no lah, the better malls and places use a system whereby if you had checked in before and you try to scan again, it will be revealed as you had oredi done so based on the last 4 digits of your nric .

isn’t it so much more convenient for the staff to just close an eye instead of the need to expose him and to file a police statement and stand as a witness if he claim trial .
so mah fun for an offence that does not hurt anyone .
but i never check out one leh .
and i can check into the same mall again .

“a lot of couples in sinkieland get married very quickly, but getting to know each other is a lifelong process, and today’s ‘fast food culture’ shouldn’t apply to marriage or it’ll be very unstable,” he mused .
ald 6 years liao where got fast food ?
really can talk his way out .
need wait until 12 years then safer meh!
so small how to piak felicia from kitchen to balcony
i hope they do one in the north .
jurong east got 2 ****ing side by side .

if open in yishun i think the people might become more atas .
myanmar and pinoys now higher than sinkieland .
really is cmi .
or continue dreaming lorl
iceland oso not all full time
yah indeed we a bunch of hypocrites mah 
i do remember a bit of dollah kassim, rajagopal, quah kim song but dont have a lasting memory so i cant tell who is the greatest sinkie footballer .
most old timers would say dollah or quah .
another good player was nazri nasir .
i would say sundram is probably by a small margin the better player .
but take nothing away from fandi .
unlike many players from his era or before that, most after reaching the local heights - malaysia cup and representing sinkieland would kind of relak a bit but not fandi .
what he lacked in skill, he strove to improve by self training and hard work .
sundram had a bit of a party animal in him .
there &apos;s a slight difference between the 2 accolades .
once upon a time, the football league in sinkieland is semi pro one and sinkieland together with thailand and maybe malaysia were the best team in the region .
everything went downhill when they turn the league into a pro one .
and btw, jin xiasuay that both the media and football are ranked 160 in the world
wow this is such a solid analysis
they participating in suzuki cup, asia cup, world cup qual, so they should choose which tournament they want to prioritise .
as for sinkieland lions, they only have suzuki cup to focus on without much distraction
can change title to 50th worst team ?
then just send them to us .
sinkie land oso turn refugees away how come us never outcry .
they dont get in , so nothing to worry about here .
cos my flip prata, they kpkb nobody help and offer their help as most are muslim, then now want to send them back cos cannot afford to have them ard or they have learned the hard way why myanmar don’t want them in the first place
and landed properties on social media ?
u pcc and cum on their face when have opportunity and then run away
diff people diff .
u cant control what they do but u can control yourself .
mute, ignore, unfriend, unfollow - so many choices at yr disposal .
you can try to doxx them by dm them their address down to the unit number .
remember watching some documentary couple years back about how some stalkers managed to dig the address of some celebs down to the unit they are staying in and their daily schedules by just analysing the small details in the photos they posted on their social media .
just saying, dont get so worked up lol .
iirc, mediacock talking point ever got a couple of bloggers, i repeat, bloggers who managed to csi where the host is living down to his unit number from studying his social media posts .
i still remembered how his jaws dropped when the bloggers handed him the "search results" .
you can always unfriend them if chiu dont like them posting on social media
it is normahl for humahns to flaunt their wealth mah .
that day i saw one ft never wear mask .
i wanted to go say him but i thought about it, what if next time he beat me up since i stay in the same area .
in the end, i just diam diam walk away
if ft, got crowd, i &apos;ll chide  .
but some pple i say, and its really they forget and u-turn back home .
in case siaolang ask me for badge 
just forgot to put mask a few days ago cos i had to pass something to my customer .
when i realized it, i really jitao jog on the spot after office hours .

duno admin will help chiu leemove thread or notch, maybe  at best help chiu mosaic face
maybe can ask them if they mask is hard to breathe or ill-fitting and give them a mask for them to try instead .
 usually most will paiseh n pull up their mask .
if lower grass ses like fw, can act moral high horse and kan
isnt that the reason u want him to wear mask in the first place ?
got a group of 3 foreign looking patients pull down mask to chit chat .
they oso had the moh form from doctor to do swab test at sash clinic, potential infected cases .
need effort and i can’t be bothered .
no vigilante actions preash .
if u kena beat, u may be left on your own to file magistrates report, pay for medical checkups etc .
if kena film getting the shiat beaten out of u, people will laugh at u for being weak .
last month i was on the mrt towards boon lay and halfway one skinny ah bang boarded and he sat opposite of me (those 2 seater seat) .
next the guy alighted and a elderly boarded and sat beside him and oso never caution him .
when i alight at boon lay, he still on the train with his face expose .

cheekon prices oso sky high 
add 1 more zero to what some sinkies spend on vnb at siam tius .
means they up-price liao ?
ts so innocent to think sinkies wont accept that offer  
is like hdb de mah .
low demand will cheaper if high demand sibei sexpensive de ler later cum out the news say which okt is arrested or burst liao then the price conberm will go up like hdb .
government cum out news say few vendor cannot tahan then hdb price pew pew up liao .
just blame ownself too poor to get it
moi nono that is why moi ask
even $2-3k once awhile oso can afford some luxuries .
but sky high prices mostly aim at those high earners or those who do pian one lor .
but most who own a condominium will not show off their kitchen cos it is fuсking small, smaller than any hdb flat .
straits times can use that heading for their future reporting : .
jin satki mens fas!
 north korea &apos;s rank is low cos they haven &apos;t been playing much and withdrew from the wc qualifiers even .
they always were a reasonably good football team in the asian context .
and when they have better players or on their day they can beat japan or korea .
youth level oso they were good .
but it remains to be seen if they can recover quickly from this self-imposed ban .
if not may take a few more years to reach asia &apos;s top 10 or even higher .
where u get all these stats and figures 
how to slip further if 160 is the last country ?
no mixed players  .
cui means cui !
vietnam will focus on suzuki cup la .
i bet my kukujiao they would not even finish 4tg in their group .
as for asia cup, they oredi qualified for the 2023 final tournament la n 2023 is still at least a year plus ah .
spore can only thrive in m league .
even got mixed player would not help .
u all remember this player anders aplin ?

do not try to act like police .
remb chuir place in the hierarchy before doing anything stupid .

just keep silent, diam diam stand one side .
there was once i offered a ft from south asia a brand new mask  but said that is dirty asked me to buy a new one  ended up i paid $30+ for a brand new box  of masks for the ft .
they dont comply, did any of the above mentioned things to you, and fellow sinkies dont come to your aid and support, instead pwn you further .
i see these people everyday leh, no mask or mask on chin .
but i dont dare to go lecture them, later kena called racist 
they wear or dont wear its none of our business they are adult if they get the covid then so be it just protect yourself wearing mask u live longer .
condominium one maybe made in japan .
  hdb made from cheena one, the cheapest type .
 very noisy one .
sometimes people come out will talk loudly one
maybe it can be irritating
condominium got security guard ?
hdb, with all the low ses and aliens, you can expect it to be very noisy .
at night can hear the lift movement .
is the si gina, neighbours like to gather near lift lobby play and talk loudly .
sometimes nearby sch students will gather there and do some actions .
u get 2 headaches
mine is old hdb lift upgrading so there’s one lift to share among 4 houses for every level .
there’s dingdong but normally cant hear much .
midnight if v quiet can hear the mechanical thud of the lift when my ear is near the wall .
my old place had a lift added after upgrading, my new place faces the lift almost directly .
not really an issue to moi .
benefits more than bad ones .
point block sibei song .
10 steps and chiu are at lift .
the lift is about 4 steps away from my front door .
door always close who walk pass oso don’t know right ?
when the people drop one by one due to covid, good luck to the economy and tourism .
dont worry, even sinkie experts have said its like flu
if you take care of your health and maintain a healthy weight with adequate exercise, there is no way you are dying to covid or even having symptoms .
but the thing is if they dont drop dead one after another then you know you &apos;ve been reading fake news, your government will flip flop their story
mask mandates and lockdowns may be doing more harm than good .
he &apos;s an ivy league scholar, so im sure he knows what he &apos;s doing .
i wouldnt go so far to say no symptoms, but i believe it will be relatively mild .
just take care of your health and weight .
you gain weight when you consume more calories than you burn .
you dont wanna take care of your own health .
it will be even more worse if you dont take the vaccine .
we can debate about the effectiveness and purpose of vaccines all we want, but it has shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and even death .
so if you are a fat ass and you do not even attempt to lose into a healthy weight, and still dont take the vaccine, then good ****ing luck to you .
lol say that in us you will kena sjw &apos;ed for fat shaming .
very scary kind that snake u in the back and displace chiur chewren from their jobs and universities .
mean and evil people mistaken kindness for weakness and will try every ways to exploit .

the managing director refuse to hand over the bank signatory even after we have added in directorship .
in dec 2919, the managing director of the company called me to assist in a loan repayment citing i am a director in the company .
thru out the cb period, the md just said that due to covid operations had stopped .
until july 2020, we realised our shareholdings and directionship had been changed without our knowledge .
any law enforcement personnel or lawyer care to comment ?
no shareholders agreement ?
funny story btw, you cannot close a company off without all directors signing, same with bank account
what is criminal breach of trust (cbt) ?
the phrase “criminal breach of trust” (cbt) may sound complicated, but let us break it down for you .
cbt usually involves a misuse of funds or property, and covers a wide range of activities .
remember the city harvest church corruption scandal ?
this misuse of funds that were entrusted to them by churchgoers is a classic example of cbt .
other cases of cbt may include dishonestly pawning off a necklace you borrowed from your friend .
according to section 405 of the penal code, cbt is committed when a person who is entrusted with property, or is given control over property, dishonestly: .
uses/disposes that property in violation of a law or contract; or .
deliberately allows another person to do any of the above .
entrustment: for cbt to be committed, a person must be either entrusted with the property, or have control over the property .
for example, bankers in charge of transferring money to another account, or admin staff who are put in charge of keeping signed cheques, are people who have been entrusted with property .
dishonesty: the person must have oso acted dishonestly .
we have file a complaint to acra since july 2020 and they have yet to revert back to us .
yes buddy, lawyer say got case, police say no case .
get caught dunno how to proceed .
lawyer fee 40 plus k .

160 means we better than 50 other countries leh .
maybe used to it liao .
lift normally wont notice much and yeah, its the people who make a lot of noise .
when they come out or wait for lift, some will laugh or talk very loudly .
in some situations, people who pressed the emergency button mistakenly will affect the units nearby as well .
lifts & lift users can generate a lot of noises if u ask me
commenter asks lawrence wong if he made  &apos;lousy school &apos; comment in parliament .
22, wong uploaded a short video of himself discussing jobs, concerns over foreign competition and unfair practices at work, and singapore &apos;s necessity of being an open economy, despite its downsides .

cheena says  &apos;uyghur tribunal &apos; that found xi responsible for  &apos;genocide &apos; is a farce .
london: the chinese embassy in london said an unofficial tribunal of lawyers that accused beijing of genocide against the uyghurs was nothing more than a political tool of china &apos;s enemies, who were spreading lies .
the unofficial tribunal of lawyers and campaigners said on thursday (dec 9) that chinese president xi jinping bore primary responsibility for what it said was genocide, crimes against humanity and torture of uyghurs and kazakhs in xinjiang .
the tribunal, which is headed by british lawyer geoffrey nice, has no powers of sanction or enforcement .
"the people &apos;s republic of cheena (prc) has committed genocide, crimes against humanity and torture against uyghur, kazakh and other ethnic minority citizens in the north-west region of cheena known as xinjiang," the british-based uyghur tribunal said on thursday .
"the tribunal is satisfied that president xi jinping  .
some foreign lawmakers and parliaments, as well as the us secretaries of state in both the biden and trump administrations, have labelled the treatment of uyghurs as genocide .
but cheena vehemently denies that .
"lies cannot conceal the truth, cannot deceive the international community nor stop the historic course of  .
cheena initially denied the camps existed but later said they were vocational centres and designed to combat extremism .
in late 2019, cheena said all people in the camps had "graduated" .
i tell you what la .
ask questions later
5 signs you &apos;re dating a liar & here &apos;s how to get yourself out of the mess .

it is very strange one, the number of sinkies willing to pay for sexxx  .
liddat they work 1 months is like work 1 year back in vietnam ?
330 for one hour one day say 8-10 clients .
3k x 22days (8days relak do nothing sleep) should be 60k or one year of median sinkie salary or 10 years of vn average pay .
you will be surprised just how little they earned back home, unless they engaged in some illegal stuff .
she deserved to ask for $330/1/1 but viet bus got what face to ask for so much
chiu ghost dome 2 gotch a few viet 220 and below

that place is a dead town even during normal times except popeye and taiwan  mala soup thingy  .
i didnt even know there is such place in orchard  .
ah gui will like it there .
these are news we need to say how badly the businesses are in sinkieland .
not how people cannot come in and affect a small minute portion of livelihood for people across the causeway who cannot go back, foreign workers and all .
take care of locals first .
like the tenants said, smrt dont bother to market the place at all .
lol i only go there when i got lost .
the phone shop how ?
yeah and that was pre-covid too .
 many people go there dabao the food there especially raining days .
dhoby i think only got just acia and blood bank ?

thanks for the excellent laugh
u all dont make scrabby ong angry hor later he chut ultimate jinx potion u all sure cannot take it
are scrabby and oyk related ?
the overlay decent sia .
he can be an actor next time
haha, and yet government & companies are complaining sinkieland lacks local digital talent - hence need to import foreigners .

in before "no one insults chiobu"
anyone know if there &apos;s any app can make jav one
tzuyu jav very popular .
but many people who read dubious news sources tio pian left right up down
since your lawyer said got case .
yes, 200k is another issue .
but step by step first lo, have to prove this is unlawful then use the verdict to wack the bugger .
if he declares bankrupt, then slowly get money back if the court rules in the favour
u invest 2xxk but dont want spend 1k to talk to a lawyer ?
bankrupt can forget about claiming money liao
ts chiu need to consult a lawyer not on edmw .
we have spent more than that to talk to lawyer .
apparently according to district judge, he declated bankrupt in august 2020 .
you read the last financial report and went through lawyer to read the company article anot  .
really sound like buying vegetable .
poh mata + call lawyer for advice .
mata say no criminality .
shareholders have no right to look at the accounts, and are you sure that you bought ordinary shares .
edmw have queens lawyer .
we push him to do it after injection of funds but he never did .
the transfer of shares part is false declaration i believe .
they simplify and let the person doing transaction self declare he have all the consent etc .
but still wont get your money back .
its hard to get back if he indeed use the money for company operations .
means not acting in the best interest of the company liao .
get back money is hard .
can get back half oso dont know
worth your time and money anot ?
just social media publish his face and company big big and xiasuay him .
jab liao trigger underlying condition how
think so far uk has been consistent and never advocated vaccine for young people
but young girls nowadays can oso be irrationally "brave", can meet him alone in his house and went inside his bedroom .
probably cant hold his lust over fresh meat  .
whosehs got girlfriend cant stray or get attracted w/ someone else .
knn i oso want to sell hamsters and hug xmm .

he openly say hes not the one means, its confirm vivi

a: no, i can assure you i did not say the "lousy school" comment .
satki liao can walk up straight
he oredi apologised for it what .
only damn bo liao people try to speculate otherwise .
lawrence wong, tsl and vb .
if he put it on record, it means not him liao .
too bad got coward dare say but dont dare admit, so he got implicated .
so did he anot made the comment .
 but i am obviously not correct since lw came out and clarified that it was not him .
meanwhile bbfas here can’t even earn $330 in 3 days
pre covid &apos;s market rate was $100 and if you offer $200 can piak raw .
sinkies are carrots good to chop, no geylang no bluewave so all paying for overpriced chicken .
liddat can just pay a bit more can get jp liao .
song song gao jurong
chop carrot until like that
sinkies still pay for it thats why they come and covid makes prices become black market as supply so low but high demand .
a lot of humsuplou oredi kena liao .
use your own hands save some money to invest then maybe one day u will oso feel this amount is a drop in the ocean for you
use hand is better rah
somemore can keep using until spoil .
those are ktv viet ladies, of cos charge so expensive la .
he mistakenly thinks its traditional herb that saves him .
and u pray sinkies dont meet a ceca snake!
bloody farking snake!
the snake was lucky not to have been laped and killed .
when he talk to me guailan .
if tomorrow you get diarrhea, report sfa & bk hq
i check oredi nothing .
and never go back to that branch ever again
i can do it for ts now
jp outlet the manager oso one kind .
think he is an malaysia indian .
ts is angtehkor clone ?
sibei satki, i clap for chiu
if dog eat liao nothing happens then you eat
so obviously dogs can eat almost anything without anything happening to them
if got pi sai inside u oso donno, eat liao oso jin ho jiak
he pcc inside the mayo chiu oso dunno  .
that &apos;s why i try not to mess with people preparing moi food 
obviously he cant do that in the short time frame  .
but its possible to take uncooked patty & rub his bare arse & then fry it
put in ziplock bag and send it for testing la .
its true, i was there heard commotion, but dont bother, so i proceed to eat my swiss mushroom double and laugh at those 2 idiots
he has only himself to blame for not studying hard in school .
just the other side (near sinkieland shopping centre) which people dont usually go .
that &apos;s another xchange .
so to come to think of it, i &apos;ve never been to orchard xchange nor heard of it before .
where is this place even located ?
unless it is subsidised by tax payers and smrt does not care whether they collect rent anot .
was popular before plaza sing extension siphoned away all the commuters .
and if tenants are comparing with ion, maybe they should oso compare the amount of rent they &apos;re paying  .
edit my bad i thought the dhoby ghaut one
nvm , completely different place lols
what is this shiat place ?
smrt is quite a shitty retail landlord, its next to ion but not even visible .
i only realised that place existed when i was shopping the t2 tea, suddenly got one opening that leads to that god forsaken ground .
is it cos of the way the escalator entry is  ?
somehow the mrt exit level and basement seems to be most popular .
smrt should lease out or sell off the retail assets to a bigger mall player .
since the beginning, never once walk past to even ssrr of what are the stuffs they sell there  .
all i can ask them is, who did they vote for ?
but business damn jialat .
smrt normally will lease the shop to event organiser like ideal connection, hemus and event business management .
similar to what we saw at serangoon interchange, hougang interchange, angmo kio interchange and etc .
mostly lease to middle man business, mark up the rent then lease out again .
so smrt will get the rental no matter if the unit is occupied or vacant .
then as for event organisers, if cannot find long term like malay kueh, handphone shop, prepack food to lease the shop, they will rent weekly to insurance, bank, electricity company to do "roadshow" for them to tout customers charging them $350 - $650 per day for a week .
why sinkieland business naming all .
like to play with x think very cool ?
that place is decent traffic since its on the way to cathay, last time went there to eat, got free flow ice cream .
but now closed liao .
total failure la .
too stingy to find a retail expert to look at it first so thats what u pay lor .
this huan not 2020 la
pika cross dress no horse run .
this one deserves a category of her .
chio, but gotch updated photo or beedio bo ?

every ndp organising chairman want to get promoted
next time count on me sinkieland & stand up for sinkieland will become iconic too .
in before motherland songs
so that they can play to keep people from talking to each other during the parade .
like if there is some interval during the parade, people may talk to each other and create noise but if you play the song for them to sing along, at less the noise is more structured .
so india can plagiarise
not really fine dining la .
wow power la bro, never invite me  ?

and mata says this ain’t a criminal case, but a civil one ?
if say never make comment, means never make unless can prove he make the comment .
i think he might have forgotten or something .
to prove it definitively, we need sound engineers or some technical experts who can conduct voice forensic analysis to prove that its really him anot .
i really salute people when everything is so obvious liao but they have the gut to deny .
hmm if he dare liddat say i don’t think he’s lying leh .
can vivian please clear this up .

i feel like a small immature kid who wants everyone to forget who he is so he can get to a desired university .
and then end up losing his aunt and his best friend and girlfriend both forgotten him .
to make this movie better, there should be a twist behind that wang came back and help him change back to the day that he first visit him .
movie targeted at kids .
very immature stupid mistakes inside .
wang as in wang leehom ?
yes, return the s$2,400+ jobs to sinkies first, keep the s$66k jobs to ramesh .
yesterday oredi say he will come out on this liao when shan ge called for debate

lol lets see 3 wood root dare to accept the challenge anot hahaha
deep fakes nowadays very good sia!

let the whole sinkieland know
nobody deserves to get cheated
the moment he refused your first request for bank signatory oredi can kick him out ?
how many % you own ?
wow then its a management decision to let him retain signatory i gues ?
tbh edmw cant help much, this is a costly thing to rectify 
are u even sure u can recover anything ?
the company got anything to liquidate ?
 what if the original owner show u accounts that they have been making losses all these while and your investment oredi wiped out ?
getting anything seems doubtful .
but my shareholders wants to see justice done .
hope u and shareholders can get closure .
lesson in life: never believe anyone(other than close family) no matter how nice or sincere they sound .
i got bitten multiple times and have basically lost faith in humans

they gotta revamp their image man .
u dont get 4 people sit in front of the telly, keep quiet and 1 person talk .
anyway what he says, sinkies oso dont like, cos sinkies find him too aggressive .
then just wait patiently for wp to raise the ceca issue lor .
but he and csj should learn how to keep their cool and debate calmly .
it is true, sinkies in general find him too aggressive .
can’t allow any tom dick harry to ask for debate .
can’t just write fb posts on this and act as a leader .
who wants a $2,400 job when i can earn $4,000 easily by being my own boss .
debates can be held in a public space as well .
cos then anyone can ask for debate on any topic and ministers will have to oblige to debate them in public .
my neighbour &apos;s black dog very humji one, only dare to barks at the weak and old .

probably he doesn’t know what to do oso since board will say no to anything that cost money, especially now smrt is privatised and own by temasak .
it will be near impossible to pull in an anchor tenant since retail is at its worst since covid .
anchor operator would rather choose to go into the mall which is keen to provide an attract rental since they will need to substantially fit the store .
place is a bad fengsui .
lots of pillar with zizag pathway with broken qi .
who is that man on the  .
“we have been trying to ask smrt to give us some assistance, but the assistance that they gave us, in the form of some rental rebate, is actually not enough to cover (our operation costs) at all,” said one tenant who runs a food and beverage outlet, and was given a 20 to 30 per cent rebate .
“how can we cope ?
i almost want to commit suicide already… i don’t really know how to move forward,” she said .
remember to thank lw for insisting that indians from india must be allowed to fly into sinkieland .
ghost town still got 30 .
top management by who .

can be fatal deh whorx .
harnorhh mmm sii lw larr is gui .
the video is quite distracting, we would think lw made the comments just cos his head was turning, but actually, listening to the audio without the video, and with amped volume, i trust that vb was the one who made the comments .
maybe he deny so that next time this wont come back to bite him in the future if he become pm .
the place is haunted… knn macham ghost story now caught on tape/ mic
zhun bo, it really sounded like him .
but since there’s no proof unless got voice recognition experts to disprove it, we oso have to accept his denial .
can he say ”must be lousy school” again, i want hear it, funny leh .
”whoever” said that just own up la, pap minister cannot handle new age pr .
if is he say, then tai ji liao liao .
can someone ask vivian to confirm he oso said lousy school ?
i keep replaying the video, and still find  &apos;lousy school &apos; the voice and tone different from vb early parts .
aiya both by vb .
no need speculate speculate ar, maybe alien .
dont look at video, and dont consider previous sentences (because someone can change their pitch when they start a new sentence) .
go to previous post with sound clip from vocaroo and keep replaying the clip from 8 second to 11 second .
didnt know vivian can imitate lawrence wong 100% .
lawrence i lost all my respect for you .
minister vb comments oso nothing wrong in first place

it really impacts one psychologically
that &apos;s a 3 years ago news about how some poor people kept falling into their own traps and never know how to get out of poverty .
sorry to hear ts needed comcare but did not get it .
isit cos you single bbfa ?
the lady in question got 4 kids to raise, probably thats why easier to get comcare
just like those edmwers whinning bto/hdb not affordable while many sinkies and residents making monies from buying and selling properties .
they need help to get out of thr tunnel vision .

how come look like hebe ?
how comes now u the one posting kym threads .
chiobu spotted   .
we do not want to very micromangaing him, but the signatory issue was never resolved .
sorry for your issue bro, cant help you, but it seems the guy knew what he was doing when he took your money .
this i will have to wait for acra to revert liao
for the share transfer back to md, it seems ts have to show proof to the police and acra that this was not authorised .
your lawyer should oso highlight this .
 without that, dont think the police or acra can do much .
it is possible to get back control of the company, if you still want it .
please hire another secretary agent or use your current lawyer to get this done .
and yeh, can sue him for the money, but unlikely you &apos;ll get back anything soon since the md is a bankrupt .
it will be good to have a shareholder agreement done up and oso do dd searches through a lawyer before investing in a business/company .
in the first place, why would this ssmc commit a $3m po to this company if the company is not financially capable on fulfilling the order ?
never do basic vendor due diligence ?
the working model is that we send in goods to ssmc on consignment .
but we do not understand how the company suddenly ceased operations oso .
roughly need 50k to get back your 200k .
hoping to get back 200k .
as i just said earlier, he decalre bankrupt liao .
so chances are lorw
aiya no need to worry .
cbt is a very powerful charge .
now find lawyer oso no use .
fight until the end, lawyer oso cannot guarantee you money can take back immediately .
but lawyer fee u confirm must give .
if you need good lawyer, let me know .
md and corp sec same person oredi an alarm bell .
then the share transfer can take effect be it via sales of share to be distributed as shareholder loan or paid in cash by the md to buy outright .
strike out companies can reopen case where fraud is involved .
if ts got a copy of that po then should verify with ssmc .
3 million usually need tender one .
this type no backing no money no other support cannot do huan .
no wonder bo lui .
he &apos;s gutsy and glad he is around in politics  but wish him to be more objective .
rather he add firepower than claim credit .
can faster fix him can anot  ?
if they really put down their faces, pride, power hungry mentality, they should form a coalition and force a good debate .

a doctor in a government hospital in madhya pradesh resigned on saturday after some congress leaders, including former minister pc sharma, allegedly misbehaved with him following the death of a patient .
while mp chief minister shivraj singh chouhan appealed to people to boost the morale of doctors instead of demoralising them, mr sharma claimed he did not speak rudely to the doctor and was only involved since the patient was a member of his assembly constituency .
"our senior doctor yogendra shrivastava has resigned after some politicians misbehaved with him .
during treatment he died, following which some politicians misbehaved with the doctor," government jp hospital civil surgeon dr rakesh shrivastava told pti .
we live in a civilised society and right now it is the time to stand together .
when contacted, mr sharma said, "the doctor did not talk to me in the morning when the family of the critical patient was trying to get him to talk to me over the phone .
instead, the doctor told them to take the patient to a private hospital .
the sad thing is he got humiliated for doing the right thing .
they are too corrupted and not building more facilities and engage more doctors with budget but rather pushing the blame to the doctors and nurses .
there are more patients than what the hospital can cope .
when politician cant solve problem, you just push or arrow .
i think for sinkieland it should be fine to open its border to accept the people over to here for treatment .
sinkieland could extend medical support and earn revenue instead and increase humanitarian image .
he can cum here cont his practice , for sure our pappy will love him  .
also, here no blame culture  .
gotch any people die due to cobid, its cos of our own complacency and fault for not listening to gahmen and @ssperts  .
even die after jab, oso will say not related to jab  .
"a doctor in a government hospital in madhya pradesh resigned on saturday after some congress leaders, including former minister pc sharma, allegedly misbehaved with him"  .
i was wondering why the doctor had to resign just cos he was naughty together with the politicians .
cecapore welcums him with no blame culture and let &apos;s move on!

which big brand want to open at a place known as ghost town ?
see la try to copy japan train station + retail/f&b concept .
linked to ion oso manage until kenasai, really is full of s*** mgmt
japan got rental caps for such establishments ?
but the paper general who took over does not seem to know how to help these shops and businesses prosper .
pap is a big failure under ah loong .
someone &apos;s vision lol, using mrt stations to milk sales, they think macam like the jap subway train stations where shops are being located .

her children can take care of her
but she does not man the stall personally right ?
he lied blatantly .
i think between them vb oredi agreed to front for all .
so many of us have been hearing his voice for so many fridays for two years oredi .
oyk how clueless he may be, i take that over lw intergity issue .
i mean if you oredi made up your mind that it’s lw no matter wat, then it doesn’t matter what they say .
if you cant take others with different opinions then you shouldn &apos;t be participating in a forum .

he oso said about wanting to eat at hawker centre or restaurant .
and how to quarantine  ?
by checking thru all his handphone, social media, email, blogs, etc to check whether he ever engage in any anti-ccp activities .
and whether any of his friends, families, associates are in the black list .
if confirmed, can send him to xj re-education camp to further quarantine .
quarantine for tiong people .
for all the ignorant ones, from sept all international travellers to cheena must enter via guangzhou and be quarantined centrally .
those going to cheena lip lai .
how much u think international travellers got to pay ?

it was an open po for 3 yrs, 3 mil was based on the consumption of the plant .
they bidded for this po before we got involve .
you sure ssmc allow blanket po for 3 years ?
they offered a 3 year cost down pricing scheme and they got a 3 yrs p .
this one not cbt ?
md changed shareholding unilaterally using corp pass .
tmd acra website facing tech issue, cannot extract info*
tq buddy, he bankrupt liao .
need to talk to share holder abt course of action .
what is the next course of action that you can take against him .
most importantly can you expose him online ?
likely we cant get anything out of the md liao .
its obvious cbt liao .
dunno isit acra see him bankrupt liao dont want to charge him .
as mentioned, if there are no implications for exposing the cheater online after consulting lawyer .
then you can report this on facebook, to wan bao, xin ming, mothership, 158 and even edmw .
i mean that cheater cannot hide corporate veil, do such things and not get caught .
then magically things will be solved somehow
i think she oredi got a job there .
ft come sinkieland .
sian of  &apos;stressful lifestyle &apos; here, still can go back country side live .
cb sinkies forever stuck here .
sinkieland attracts mercenaries .
both desperately want to get out of spore .
good continue the empty promises given to the people many ft will see it themselves .
they will never lift the restrictions no matter how many jabs u take .
and how is it sinkies fault again ?
these are the fairweather expats who cannot take a bit of hardship .
we dunnid such weaklings .
they can fug off .
sinkies are crazy to believe the promises again and again when none of it is being given .
yah fark off and dont come back .
angmo or south asia ?
even sinkies oso leeches la .
just that many of us want to run oso nowhere to run
but cooking jin tiring .
my friend said many msg
you never know what goes inside the big cooking pot of soup .
sure healthy, no msg or added flavour .
add a bit of salt .
2021 liao still got people believe the msg hoax ?
depends on how the hawker prepare the stock .
some stalls i know take hours to boil the soup and they use chicken, pork bones, fish bones, beans, onions, garlic etc .
some stalls take the short cut and just use rice water with some chicken bones, and a tonne of msg, salt and fish sauce .
if you think the soup has a lot of msg, just skip the soup .
unless they say they no put msg, usually most outsai food got put .
get those with spinach ones .
got taste, means flavour gao gao .
flavour gao gao means, simisai oso put inside .
then you dont think healthy anot lor .
can do pepsi bljnd test .
one ownself cook with msg .
one ownself cook without msg .
then can really tok
i think more like when the soup left over alot so they add water and add msg to top up so the soup is like cook long long liao then got the full flavour .
the  &apos;take hours to boil the soup and they use chicken, pork bones, fish bones, beans, onions, garlic etc .
 &apos; sound like wife cook for family then will use the effort to slowly boil the soup into flavour .
or u can refer to hospital food
nowadays sinkieland diners very smart one  .
they will siam the stall forever, unless they enjoy and dont mind the artificial flavouring .
thats why some fish soup stalls are more popular than others, and usually its the food quality that attracts the long queues .
i think the only food that &apos;s truly healthy if u eat out is salad with no dressing .
fish soup not necessarily more healthy bec its lower in oil but there are fried fish soup oso many fishes used actually are high in mercury .
soup stock wise oso a lot use too much msg .
tiagong amk that one better
oredi comes w/ egg & begedil: $2 .
aussie there have anot ?
have asian food but cannot compare the taste like that
this one no where near the best .
those power ones got an old school taste, i cant describe but very hard to find these days .
dunno how to apprrciate .
the best one should be this one .
this guy pwn everyone !
one of their neighbours lagi worse .
only belachan and haebi taste .
maybe is another style ?
can try inspirasi neighbour .
cant remember exact store .
pretty salty, haebi + belachan taste .

most memorable saga was matchy and ce_lau story .
they got to one another in real life, thatntime got plenty of gathering in edmw one .
then they got to know one another n start spendin time solo, then one day got dispute .
cuz matchy is a gambler , like to bet to soccer , thus only have $10 budget per day .
cannot spend more than that when dating, then ce_lau mm got angry and all .
then matchy blame her for not stopping him from gambling .
then one day apparently, ce_lau kena preggy by one of the edmwer here then dissapear liao .
if you think ccb is chio, wait till you see gloria

oso a bit non existent
they government has parachuted in too many inexperienced guys from mindef .
this place always nice and quiet .
the justasia always quite full in the past .
too bad the layout is damn weird
dont knw how long these malls can tahan .
sinkieland all along too dependent on ft and tourists liao to support mall businesses .
raffles place xchange .
but the shops are those chapalang accessories shop, food, etc .
nothing really worth visiting for in the first place .
58 this year liao .

maybe last time when she was young .
i can recognise that stall if i past by .
she go local uni sure kena fuck de
jus be spokesperson for some company lol, other jobs out dere sure cannot compete with the ft legion la .
seems like there &apos;s no photo of her younger days being displayed on the net 
it is unknown whether she can do it or she will become what her dad did in chasing his passion all the time .
typical greedy sinkie .
alot of my friends oso took many course .
cos subsidised by gahment .
so has she switched career now after getting so many useless diplomas ?
anyway got those voice matching software to identify the person who said that ?
need to get to the bottom of it .

the ones beside him and the one behind him are the likely ones .
i thought a heard a particular minister &apos;s voice but he &apos;s a little too far away .
the one behind vb is quite likely to be one of them ?
behind vb is koh poh koon who was an ri boy and son of punggol
think he is too shrewd to say something liddat .
moi believe too how he survive if he was actually the one who said it .
i think u r the v worked up one .
he never say he cannot live with your comments too .
wow the plot very similar to squid game episode 6, every man for himself!
lol your ear got problem .

last time quite easy to find, even those primary school stalls got that special taste mee rebus, i cant describe how &apos;s the taste like but i think most uncles know what i am talking about .
bedok 58 there got one come close, but sauce is too thick .
famous cos last time got $2
when come to food is up to individual taste .
for moi is the joo chiat one 
bedok 58 got one new stall , open beside the indian mee goreng that always open evening time .
saw a lot of people eat that mee rebus stall .
parkway parade basement before the major renovation used to have a good mee rebus stall, young that time i take special bus trip to go there eat one .
best mee rebus i &apos;ve ever had was a malaysian hawker .
boiled with crab shell, its got bits and pieces of crab there, with chopped prawn fritter and potato+tomato broth .
eat my black seaweed nicer .
amk central one better
amk one jin ho jiak .
serangoon garden … mee rebus, soto ayam and mee soto .
i stay jurong and that’s the only stall that can make me drive all the way there if i crave for good mee rebus .
for me is sungei gedong camp canteen  
rahim and afandi very good!
their so call endemic sio .
at this rate not boom liao meh
you can be lawyer .
do we have such a big population ?
yall how old alrdy still believe miw
sinkieland most probably cease to exist by now
but only on the speech, power point, and charts part .
leeplaced by even more third world fake talent who are here to leech
hood to see true colors .
take spore government gif a good ride .
then they can teh their lumpas lor .
no chance to defend them one .
before sh1t happens all gone liao…faster than you can imagine
3,000 ftrashes n ctrashes chiong in .
pinkie and his friends welcome all foreign trash talents and chennai biz park full of “south asian talents” .
many many condominiums full of such “talents” who cannot make it back home - if all of these people can fug off then i’ll be delighted sia .
if such sinkies did not and/or unable to ‘upgrade’ themselves,  .
wanna blame who leh ?
just go la 1 expat go, 3 will come replace them huan .
not the first time liddat liao, they never wanted to stay here forever in the first place  .
no mask hope they kena covid again and again until see they scared covid or covid scared them 
why open big big liao, still people run away hah ?
to replace any 1 angmo who leaves, there are at least 10 million indians from india fighting and jostling to be first in queue to swarm into sinkieland .
they wont get robbed or mugged .
reminder that pap &apos;s retarded half assed flip flopping covid policies are a result of them giving in to 3rd world trash in the first place
only sinkies carry the virus
go home and dont come back la bhutto
this is another example of half or partial truth painted by the main stream media in sinkieland to suit their narrative .
yes, it is true that quite a number of expat families have re-located from sinkieland over the last two years .
i have had four expat colleagues that left sinkieland over the last two years, citing the strict covid restrictions here .
but their jobs did not go to sinkies .
there is even one expat i knew who returned home in june 2020 at the height of the first wuhan wave .
in the end, he got a new job in sinkieland again through his white boys expats network .
so much for fair weather fts; when they cannot find another better job elsewhere, they will still come back to sinkieland .
for those who went to tourists spots like rws recently, you &apos;ll know its a dead town at all the tourist spots with the majority of the restaurants catering to foreign tourists staying shut .
at rws, the korean food court is closed for good and malaysia street is barely hanging on to its life, operating at 1/3 capacity .
so even at an infection rate of 4%, 400 imported covid cases daily simply means around 10,000 foreign travellers are flying into sinkieland every day and i dare say most of these incoming foreign travellers are not holding short-term tourist visa .
i find gloria cuter

clicking  &apos;next &apos; page of the thread continuously oso cannot catch up the last post .

the government wont lose one, retail/rental make more money than rail business .
this whole damn exchange above orchard station used to be a super huge popular bookstore .
not sure if all you old birds can remember .
they wont care whether it will rent out anot .
sounds like jialat mgt from landlord
only jollibee or starbucks with many many seats for students can survive there .
incidentally i was at raffles place x change and it seem lots of units are untenanted .
some stations has the power utility occupiying the station space .
japan underground metro malls got pet shops got arcade got a lot fnb outlets… .
sinkieland ones like walking through a ‘under construction’ site / shuttered corridor… really no life .
seems like a good location but for some reason i’ve never seen smrt advertise it or heard about it or even manage to pass by it .
japanese concept la .
city link is one example mah .
japan jr and third sector railways like keio buy the land, build the railways and train stations, then build the shopping centers around the train station .
only got popeyes and some wmother shops there
only bought food from poepeyes chicken last month, got a shock it’s like ghost town upstairs .
even pre covid it was oredi a dead town .
i only pass through to get to a bus stop .
smrt as a landlorrd can enjoy the empty hoarded stores lorr
its near the ion escalators to the bus stop along orchard boulevard .
never even seen the entrance of it before .
that &apos;s how much smrt bothers to advertise and help tenants .
the location is actually damn good .
it used to be a huge popular bookstore holding that space during the early days .
actually should just rent the entire space out to don don donki they should be able to prosper but they act smart and sub-divide it into smaller shop units now so its too late .

how can anyone be so shameless ?
yah its not lw .
but when most who heard it can identify that comment strongly as lw &apos;s unique voice, then there is strong evidence to suggest it is lw voice .
it cannot be most heard it wrongly .
to be identified later when some voice engineer use forensic tech to proof it is his voice will be a catastrophe for lw .
and how trustworthy are our media ?
there are better tools than this la .
in courts people plenty of lawyers use voice analysis tools to argue who said what in recording

rast time moi work ard paya lebar there, every 2-3 days in a week during lunchtime will jiak the mee rebus  .
those who missed the parkway basement one, it is now located at haig road hawker, facing the mall .
one thing the bedok one does right is that they give a lot of noodles, eat sure full one .
the standard has dropped a lot compared to the past .
there are better mee rebus elsewhere in sinkieland .
either the egg looks big or the plate is small

she can get multiple within 2 years plus, local institution must be damn lousy at teaching .

cos the yellow noodle itself and the hard boiled egg nothing special, even if chiu were add some cheekon and sambal in it to go with chiur mee rebus  .
actually hor, whenever moi at budok int hawker moi without fail wud buy the economical nasi lemak instead  .
the one the signboard that simply named nasi lemak  .
add 1 cheekon wing, 1 long flat fishcake and 1 luncheon meat all less than $3  .
plus a pack full of rice (50cents nia) if dabao , damn worth value huan  .
i find mee rebus, mee soto most places taste the same .
and toban extent mee siam

the one at chong boon market tried bef dont find it nice .
one of the best soto ayam is at changi village hawker ctr .
only station that oso supported local artists
think nowadays alot like to suka suka add in rapping style in song or sing song it in rap style .
but its not nice leh, only a minority of the song hear liao still ok, but quite alot sound like very forcefully put together, and some dont really rhyme much .
not sure if people taste have gone bad or weird twisted oredi .
with or without covid they would have gone to nyc la .
ask sinkies to repent ?
zhaborh here should have her mindset then can increase birth population .
the thing i like about angmo and other fts like japanese are they dont like to stay here permanently .
meanwhile ceca is bring whole village over to stay forever .
ya position can be taken by local if government enforce it
hope you got a good time here 
so that they can hire more angmo
they stay in a nice condominium oredi cannot stand it here, what about the locals who stay in cramped and low ses hdb flats ?
foreigners think sinkiepore is heaven - place to make money and enjoy - until they get a real taste of the pap gahmen .
hdb bigger size leh for same price / rental .
quite a few of my coy expats came here with the expectation that they can travel and explore south east asia .
the timing too suay for them .
the elite management style only the south east asia and cheena citizen can take it .
if cant have everything, would rather have nothing .
it would be sad and tragic if it is ultimately foreigners that can convince the gahment to do certain things while citizen opinions hold no sway .
if giant got promotion on fresh prawns, really super cheap .
go different supermarkets to buy their loss leaders lor .
can save money  .

knn pap why you let them have holiday .
can start hearing more kids playful shouting in the neighbourhood liao .
just in time for the relaxation of restrictions from tomorroww
i oso want school holidays .
it depends on how many vampires vs werewolves .
so one  scarlet witch will own them all gaogao
stronger as in fighting lor .
vampire oso mah .
before gay shinning vampires become popular, werewolves are typically use as minions or followers by vampires in many rpg setting one .
in most fiction, vampires are more powerful but i think that is really most due to their mind control and charm .
hence most vampires have a lot of underlings even powerful ones which make them very powerful .
in a one on one fight, i dont see how werewolves are inferior  .
in fact vampires weakness to sun is one major achilles heel .
being killed by sunlight is one major weakness .
cause in many high fantasy fiction, the higher level vampire, especially those ancestral lord and elder level is either immune to sunlight or have some form of sun resistance that enable them to still survive or even live normally under sunlight .
just that in most case even if they are immune to sun normally they can only fully utilize their mythical dark power (as high fantasy fiction lord and elder level vampire normally process the same dark power as demon and devil, but unlike demon and devil their dark power are weaker in the daze) at night nia, but they still able to retain most of their traditional power in daze time like charm & mind control, immunity to physical harm aka immortal, transformation into mist or creature etc .
in many high fantasy fiction the high tier vampire oso no have physical form and\or wont appear in their true physical body form one, so to kill them is have to find their hidden real body\corpse else even the stick through heart method is wont be able to kill them .
vampyres get moar chiobus
cai png sellers stronger .
they got choppers made with silver n whole body smell of garlic .
dropping liao, an la .
don forget the country has illegal immigrants too .
 curve is flattening

will you take the job if your pay is 50% more ?
piak first think later 
i took a part time 20h per week wfh job that pays 70-80% of my previous full time 45h salary .
no i dont work with any sinkie .
i work with americans and prc sibei song
hws they pays chius ?
if you are the only remote sinkie in the job role, all your colleagues are in us, then how ?
according to sinkie, more money = more priority and respect tio bo ?
so if gahment truly want to inculcate culture of giving up seat, why not charge higher fares to those who need them ?
if they pay higher fare, regular sinkie confirm obligated to give up seats for them mah .

committee of privileges will present findings on raeesah khan case  &apos;in due course &apos;: tan chuan jin​ .
raeesah khan testifies before the committee of privileges on dec 3, 2021 .
singapore: the committee of privileges has “looked at” the formal complaint against former workers’ party member of parliament (mp) raeesah khan’s breach of parliamentary privilege and “will be presenting (its) findings and recommendations to parliament through (its) report in due course” .
in a blog entry posted on the parliament website on monday (jan 3), speaker of the house tan chuan jin said the committee of privileges “will thoroughly investigate the complaint to uphold the sanctity and integrity of parliamentary privilege” .
“the recent complaint that we looked at – and for which we will be presenting our findings and recommendations to parliament through our report in due course – is an important reminder that mps must not wilfully abuse the immunity and privileges being an mp accords them,” he said .
ms khan, formerly an mp for sengkang grc, resigned in november after she admitted to lying in parliament about a sexual assault case, which she had claimed was mishandled by the police .
mr tan said in his blog that all mps enjoy parliamentary privilege, which gives them immunity from prosecution and civil lawsuits for the statements they make in the chamber so that they may speak freely on matters and issues .
“nonetheless, the onus oso lies with every mp to apply due diligence and responsibility even as we exercise this privilege .
“the committee of privileges thus takes any formal complaint about breaches of privilege seriously, and i, as the speaker of parliament, am the chair of this ssc (standing select committee) .

"if you were to summarize the march of physics over the last 10,000 years, it would be the distillation of the laws of nature into four fundamental forces .
newton &apos;s law unleashed the industrial revolution .

cant imagine if everything &apos;s nuclear powered in future .
actually what is there to suppress when countries changed their side to cheena .
they will have to share half of the globe with tiong .
big bro cannot suka suka start war like in the past they did it to middle east .
as for sinkapore, familee prefer to stand leader together with big bro than under ccp with same skin color .
that &apos;s how nuclear power is generated these days what .
i dont regard cheena as my motherland .
the chinese in cheena are not the same as those in taiwan or malaysia or sinkieland .
scold somemore la .
i oso join in and anyhow scold people .
fission is unclean and produce radioactive waste .
anyway, the point is, industrial revolution is powered by energy .
imagine mankind will be able to travel to distant galaxies etc .
actually i dont believe that the  &apos;new world order &apos; that we commonly referred to got any relation to ccp .
the commonly known  &apos;new world order &apos; if come to light, more like is a plan that is administered by various countries together .
let them enjoy la .
later they make noise again

looks like the 3g got to hang around longer liao
no one admitted  .
the one that didnt taught integrity ?
oso sounded like lw to me, but since he publicly say not him and we oso cannot prove its him, then its between him and vivian to settle liao

some say always jiak jap bentos dont make u obese like cai png .
but price diff is big sia .
bento quality, cai png is quantity .
see which one u prefer and feel more worth
cai png uses styrofoam box .
cai png all throw together, mix until like pig feed, very low ses .
you use bento tray to dabao cai png = bento
difference is some can afford jap bento .
some only can eat cai png .
bibimbap oso low ses, how come so expensive ?
should price it the same as cai png .
cai png more rice than bento .
nasi padangmore rice than bento .
but nasi padang and cai png same same different dish selection
cai png + short grain rice = bento
low ses moi is can jiak whatever thrown to moi, beggar cannot choose
cai png is life
which one more nice to jiak
cai png - easy, no fuss packaging .
my fren who always go jpn says their train bentos are one of the finest food .
bibimbap is fixed ingredients, all the texture and taste is harmonized when eaten together .
cai png curry mix with tomato sauce mix with soy sauce, all stir together is like rubbish .
cai png if different dish served in separate bowls will be nicer, like some peranakan dinner set .

cheena will resist the new world order 
the illuminati card game by steve jackson released in 1994 have many cards depicting a new world order .
to truly progress to a kardashev type 1 civ (world-city; able to harness energy on a planetary scale), it would take a literal new world order to do so .
more than just an anemic and toothless un .
there are many things that we are oredi capable of, just lacking the collective political will to carry it through and advance ourselves .
to be forced into action, so to speak .
but the scary thought is how many people need to die before that happen .
so new world order can do wat
simpsons got talk about this ?
where can buy this card game ah ?

he is a fresh graduate .
deployed him to tag along with a non-graduate technician supervisor for on the job training with a team of technicians, do some technical work to understand the nature of the work and challenges we face so that when he is leading the team he knows how to respond and have better working synergy with the technical team .
knn, the company employed him for one month and the company is willing to overpay him, to train him for a couple of months and he left only after a month .
where to find engineers who are willing to sweat under the hot sun and manage rough employee ?
why didnt employ lao jiao
the supervisor is a very lao jiao .
you pay him how much ?
he is a fresh graduate, $3 .
maybe he give the young engineer problem behind the scene ?
kor kor chiu got internship mah can offer moi
own target own time no boss to report to ?
ceca gonna take over the position soon .
knn become kkn .
my current job has met all those criteria, some days have to work unpaid overtime too but im not leaving cos pay is decent and if i change job, no one can guarantee that i will get the same good co-workers that i have now .
5k consperm alot of fresh grad will cum snatch
not everyone  can or willing to handle rough employees .
in the 1st place why hire rough employees ?
do u really need uni grad to lead the team, if the diploma holder can write basic reports ?
seems that many people keep borrowing these days
my block oso got someone borrowing money .
got lady in hot pants accompanied by 2 hunky bodyguards with tattoos every sunday morning .
all 3 wearing staki lanyard with photocard and carry files .
if the debtor chao kuan and mai pay up, they oso llst right ?
not like they can hoot the guy or hang pig head
those agency got work on weekends one meh ?
the debtor confirm feel xiasuay one please!
so much noise and the neighbor confirm wondering why
the hunky bodyguard got wear jacket behind saying big big "debt collection in progress .
not just about borrowing money leh .
business buy goods oredi dont want to pay up .
or car/reno companies take money never deliver,etc .
if the other party dont pay, you still need to engage your own either lawyer or debt recovery to get the money .
huh, like this got use meh .
the debtor can just say a few words and then ignore them right ?
where got incentive for debtor to pay anything .
yes debtor can ignore them .
but they will just keep looking for debtor non stop lor .
go house find, go workplace find .
so they take a % of what they manage to collect .
if you follow priority list of payment by liquidator, all the small suppliers practically no chance of getting any share of the money .
cos the list prioritises the big boys, liquidator first, then the banks and landlords, utilities, then anything left then will go the suppliers .
those that can take the hits are given money first ironically .
those that cannot take the hit are taking the biggest hits .
just need to look tough and flex muscle nia .
i bet they cant handle garie .
she got 1 very nice cny song .
some u use jap bento box but the quality is cannot
i think real jap bento is v diff from what we have in sinkieland which is localized .
a lot of time we buy are piping hot .
in jap bento r cold, most people oso dont heat up, just eat it liddat and they oso eat v little compared to us .
last time i was really excited to go jap eat their bento, must say look is v nice but we are more used to our cai png style of warm, strong smelling food .
these are disgusting, some of them can really cheapen the food by cutting corners and serving crap .
ingredients not fresh, deep fried dripping in old oil, some diluted curry with round grains that &apos;s not even japanese rice and they think they can call that japanese food .
i miss the bentos you get in taiwan at the train stations .
no is more rike piak a jiuhu bu vs jippun bu .
jiuhu bu is no fuss integrated experience from massage to piak .
jippun bu, got menu one .
obviously you neber go soapland in shinjuku before .
not expert but think more original jp food often is more than just the food itself bah .
got woo before ?
have dated broken/damaged girls, pua sianz when you find the wrong type of girls, all the guai guai ones all hide at home, than those loves to seek validation all running around

trust me, you got to be brave, most importantly, you got to care enough to find a gf .
32 year old, no wet hole, stay home eat polo .
you go out there right now, see chiobu, hoot, use mouth not use hands arh .
get reject a hundred time, get reject enough you will get a girlfriend eventually .
you all have diff personality, character, family upbringing, values, mindset .
23 nia complain no gf
u try dating apps bah .
is still got good girl if u dont set expectations too high .
one was a gold digger…to the point that it was my friend who made me see what i have become (basically an unlimited atm for her), one was cos i didn’t confess and she went for my friend and third the girl got bored 
got tired of it and very few matches 
this is so true, ah gui biggest regret is never chase girls hard enough while in school
heng moi know love is but an illusion .
23 only kaopeh so much for f ?
sometimes just need to have the guts to say how u feel  
since u wan a relationship .
u wols liao, some coffee shop up the prices of their drinks late last year  .
portion oso smaller liao
the hot mike problem la .
at the same time, lw saying: my nasi lemak just now damn lousy .
so happen the mike capture the words: lousy and school consecutively lah, so sounds like lousy school
why did the speaker of parleenent not get to the bottom of it ?
cant be ms vivian uttering it to mr vivian right ?
if do, need to send him to imh for checkup .
im dead sure if the remark was made by opposition mps, confirmed all in it will be identified .
sure big case till they cannot get away with just a simple apology .
vivian admitted his portion of remarks with lmw as the latter posted on his fb and at same time queried who said the rest .
if vivian said everything he wld have further clarified with lmw and lmw wld have provided an update .
looks like can see a bit of mouth movement as the words spoken but video too pixelated to confirm .
based on his personality as seen on tv and other social media,there is no telling such remarks cannot be associated with him just ytd he labelled the 2 psp ncmp as  .
bro, diam diam no admit is one thing… .
but now is go next level double down to make fb post black and white on leecord to say not him leh… .
just like covid no horsepeter beds never mind .
but steel no cb or ha to break transmission and double open up for fts to fly in fly out to worsen the problem…
pretty obvious they have discussed and one should take one for the team .
he very confident no one can find out who the other person is ?
speaker of parliament just sweep under the carpet liao although the public has the interest to confirm whether it was vb talking to himself since lw denied .
if lmw made the illiterate remark, we can imagine he being asked for evidence of illiteracy , then he oso need to apologize to ri, get big persecution liao .
yah vivian ownself talk to ownself in parliament is really sth wrong leh .
if at home or alone still can understand .
a lot of people try to process thoughts and talk to oneself .
i never believed lawrence wong said lousy school .
if lw said he is not the one, then most likely to be vb .
if this is the case, why cant vb just admit that he is the one since he oredi apologize .
the lack of clarification makes it natural for people to guess and take sides .
it is really unfair to lw if he is not the one .
the speaker should oso raise this matter up to stop another embarrassing episode from happening in future .
we need world class debates in parliament, not coffee shop talks .
everyone has to watch what he or she speaks/behaiour in parliament, be it mike on anot .
cannot be vivi senile ownself ask question ownself leeply ownself de… .
these people oso assured sinkies that we are their priority at every election .
knn need to subscribe 154 to read the article  .
is drop to 160 liao
left one is durian seller la .
look at singapore, any novice can start a durian business .
drive plane no need perfect eyesight ?
the pilots laid off had to drive taxi and private hire car .
can still get close to airpork
oh by the way ltc food taster here haha
airline captains leh .
this is just their past time business to get together and mingle with milfs and zhabors while waiting for sky reopening .
i bet their management are hardly affected .
work horse always suffer .
if they know someone who knows someone, then its easy to get in durian directly from plantation owners  .
my friend is sia pilot, still receiving most of his basic pay despite not working much for more than a year
they must be malaysian lor and have plantation back in their malaisia
they are smarter than those useless ones who work as social distancing ambassador  .
sell durian can earn gao gao like aeroplane captains .
lip lai share share 
20" longer than moi kukujiao
limpeh is 80 inch long .
1 for gaming the other watch viu disney+ netflix or surf net lor .
not so sure should change to 32 inch next time .

23", use damn long never die so no reason to upgrade/change .
those using tv rikisiao lang 
my monitor is philips 17", that time sls got promo, so i hoot .
very nice still must take teksi 
now wfh with office laptop, its hooked up to a 40 inch tv .
has been around since george bush jr time la .
why specifically only little bush time leh ?
the chinese in sinkieland are oso not the same as those from malaysia or taiwan .
you tried speaking engrish to an educated malaysian chinese before ?
can vomit blood .
yeah, we are definitely different due to our nationalities .
when i see malaysian chinese, i would ask if they studied in a chinese medium school or bm medium school .
they can be very different in their world views .
that, is a fact we all cannot deny, wfh oredi happened, office space will no longer be as valuable .
i can count at least 5 definitely came in to real life
cheena is just a strawman .
the powers to be control the whole world including nk and iran .
maybe but people who go full yolo and borrow money usually oso very thick skin one, they might just insist on not returning
you can don’t return $$, but you still need $$ to live by .
thats a lot of work for the dc without a guaranteed payout, oso debtor can wfh, do other own business or even go overseas .
not practical to hire dc to claw back tiny amount of money
just need to apply for anti harassment protection order, these bengs cannot even come near u .
my customer just go to court , pay couple of dollar, get a anti harassment order, no one can go near him .
why the creditor cannot go down personally to chase himself, he got the right as well right ?
if debtor don’t pay call police, get police report turn it into a civil case .
i think these dc can be a nuisance, especially those innocent neighbours and bystanders oso kena harress .
hdb i see many of these type of cases .
can’t hide anymore
owe money dont want pay the people will feel xiasuay de meh
no one or that specific debt collection agency ?
liddat  can always engage other agency
liddat go collect cash, who will return  ?
got higher pay still waiting for what ?
of course jump la .
now you really think got loyalty to company one meh ?
fresh grad maybe tried to suggest an improved routine using iot, some it controls then the lao jiao dunno north south east west and rejected .
how to lead a team liddat in the future ?
the company wasted so many months of salary keeping these low productivity workers .
aiya, might as well go to another company that is more progressive .
a lao jiao line manager (mechanical, process) jjww .
1st week cher tried to teach some cad and he was struggling .
tried to be a good classmate and wanted to help him, from cad to do he dont understand, reduce level teach him what is points, edge, line, dont understand, okie, reduce level teach him how to create a folder to store his cad files, dont even know how to create a new folder .
wa pianz, asked him er he do process ?
oh, he knows excel, everyday manage cnc, milling, etc proessing jobs and production control .
so how you do one ?
er, everyday got printout of excel timesheet, he takes hardcopy, qty 3, go f the technican make qty 3, end of day tick checkbox .
qty 5 only get 4 ?
nabe liddat technical manager ?
some of our seniors really it challenge, cannot catch up with the moving industries liao or scared to change .
5k of cos run road la
cut him some slack .
he may not have the character to handle and manage a team .
and he may not be a hands on guy in the 1st place .
i am in a similar position as your engineer .
he is thinking ahead to the day he has to take over the job of the supervisor .
this is the problem with sinkieland engineering scene, expect too much from engineers and split technical roles into technicians and engineer .
tbh, i find some technicians role are more suited to be paid engineering salary and engineering roles who are leading a team of technicians should be a senior technician like your laojiao supervisor .
they study so hard for degree oredi why bother to toil under sun or harsh conditions daily .
i am sure there were hundreds of qualified applicants and waiting to take his place .
dunnid to think so hard to give excuses for a poor hire choice or even attack the quitter .
fresh graduate, zero experience .
sinkies are rike dat one .
the available pool of engineers in sinkieland is hot property .
if can jump better jump now, and can demand higher salary .
i got one engineer in the company i worked in, quit end 2020 .
then last week i saw him visit, driving a brand new smy toyota corolla .
previously he take the company transport to office .
free internship can ma
knn why you never wonder why this fresh grad will leave your job .
your side toxic culture and people, many ot and lower than industry standard pay isit .
of course he found better pay of course hop la .
job hop means got job opportunities .

and how you renovate, your neighbours would still be low ses hahahaha .
actually, most condominium residents oso behave low ses   .
i dont do instagram and i dont use the condominium facilities (except maybe the gym, but then again i go to another gym) .
i prefer the larger space since that &apos;s where i spend most of my time .
 choice to work here can be easily overridden by a mask  ?
common la when their own country dont even want them
i thought only my dad &apos;s generation use yehudi .
now still many restrictions of course wanna leave lo
how come people can find job easily but sinkie just cannot get out .
more will come in from south asia
government oredi said we  not enough local talents so need come in more foreign talents .
so you expect us being no talented can find work elsewhere ?
in their home countries, they can socialise freely, go to restaurants and bars in bigger groups, and even not wear masks .
still, we cannot lift restrictions and let imported cases go out of control .
he never get invited to the big expat party at clarke quay over new year ?

or you are one of those sinkies who bought into the ministerial propaganda of sll fts are playing for team sinkieland .
whats the correlation here ?
moi can only see big breast 
yes, no one likes u .
i think after that i became super edgy and as such, the third girl got bored of me  .
thats what my friend say as well…finding a wrong girl is worse than not having one at all .
i just dunno how to care about woman at this age .
bro, i oso lah,  what to do .
i totally know how u feel

sick of people using cheena as the bogeyman .
cheena even if double or triple their current strength cannot fight the whole world .
both napoleon and hitler found out the hard way, i am sure xi wont make the same mistake .
the world at 6 billion population closing in on 7 billion should worry about how to keep their mouths fed .
with climate getting worse every passing year, wont be long before we get a famine of epic proportions .
maybe then a world war might even be a good thing, reduce the world population by a third .
if that dont do it, maybe another virus might do the trick .
that &apos;s human natural instinct to self regulate .
the rich countries will be forced to support the poorer ones .
and we all saw how successful that is .
faster reset lah
i just wanna go isekai nia 
in the end, i hope the oppressed citizens all over the developed world will eventually get fed up and revolt!
the leader of the nwo will be from a superpower country .
possibly the usa or cheena .

used to have envisiontec in my lab but decommissioned liao haha .
i dont understand why some people insist that there were 3 people talking and lw was one of them .
liang popo makes wo wo sound u cant tell
why never come out clarify this issue ?
he probably has been waiting for a long time for someone to ask the question so he can deny making that remark, and most importantly, tell others involved that he didnt  &apos;gold finger &apos; him/them .
 if i was him, i would probably get a stooge to post that question so i can answer it .
3 pax uncle beer talk oredi so low .
doubt he can survive whiter than white if he actually said it and double down to deny .
pluck out one by one .
the 3rd person who said something about how lmw got into ri; must be sitting near the above 2 persons .
people say can tell from voice, but i cannot .
but based on 2 things - his body language and his emotional bank account (eba) , my judgement is it’s not him .
 he appeared to be minding his own business as if thinking “this loose cannon viv just leave him alone”, and  from personal experience , others tend to leave such loose cannons alone cos they will oso turn on you .
the earlier viv self talk can be rubbished and i am not going to bother about him .
now that he has clarified, i doubt he will lie cos it would mean to viv and tan that he is willing to lie for such a seemingly trivial matter…though they are in same party, they are oso sizing up each other .
lpp crying liao 
can someone repeat to me the conversation again .
i want to analyse the content to see if the content and sequence can be spoken by the same person .
which means he is oso too shrewd to admit .
agree, among them lw is the only one to i say well done .
not easy but anyone can do .
if u throw in one more slim atb or vietbu, im sure will be fun

ownself stupid but blame others are the worst .
definitely partial blame .
in my opinion def got part to play .
and its not like acct holders are responding to get rich quick scams
no machine learning ai to detect sudden unusual large transfer to foreign entity ?
at least stop the transfer and get a service staff to manually call lah
how can let scammer take money out from the account holder ?
stupid jiu shi stupid simi fearful ?
ocbc could have stopped it earlier .
yup that &apos;s why i said their fraud department is really cui .
the scams can go on for days ?
only cheat brainless class .
oredi withdraw everything from the bank .
user kum gong and ocbc system not robust enough .
example if their total internet banking account is 1 trillion, everyday large volume of physical cash is transfer globally ?
all go hor-lan liao .
criminal can go there and will never be extradicted
i though should be all ocbc fault ?
im shocked people here can blame the victims .
just hope your aged relatives dont fall victim cause you would be singing a diff tune then
hope more follow in his footsteps
sinkies provide the services, manage and run the hotel business on our own, draw good management salaries and pick up valuable high level management skills .
but problem is all the high management jobs, good salary jobs and international business skills are given to foreigners while singaporeans, even very qualified and educated ones are relegated to being chambermaids to serve fts in their own  country .
why are we singaporeans, highly educated and qualified in our country be second class residents to fts hiring manager who hire and give out good jobs and opportunities among themselves within the fts expats networks ?
why pm lee like to put fts on a pedestal while vilifying and condemning our our sinkies .
if running under the hot sun and humid rain for 8 to 10 hours a days doing physical manual labour to run around to deliver food and groceries to fts working from home in their nice cushy condominium is not proof of sinkies being able to take hardship and picky about jobs, i dunno what is .
it’s actually easier to find job there now, they experiencing the “great resignation” need as much talent and workers as they can get their hands on atm
c guys will come take their place .
they oredi know the issue that &apos;s why trying to cheat on the case number to justify they can open further .
sinkieland will end up like monaco  .
in monaco being a millionaire is like someone staying in condominium in sinkieland .
 its just middle class  .
and its the french residents who stay there who serve them .
except in singapore,  sinkies serve third world indians

most sinkies are peasants nia, who cares if they live true to their peasant nature by working as serfs ?
and they voted in the same way, the first floodgates with the largest tsunami wave was carried out by the father .
once hired, dont put any high hopes that the person will stay for a long time .

the only way to have real sinkies willing to take anything is when the whole economy tanks and sh*t hits the fan .
solution - pay higher / learn how to motivate youngsters / wait for economy to tank / hire ft  (choose one!
keep it up go ahead and employ your third world engineers just cos they are willing to work harder for that pathetic 3 .

but sinkieland is oso in a new phase, with a high level of vaccine coverage, he added .
as the government continues to monitor the situation, it will oso expand the nation &apos;s vaccination and testing regime .
mr ong said about 85 per cent of the population would have been fully vaccinated against covid by this month .
added mr wong: "we have oredi reached very high levels of vaccination - we are one of the foremost countries in terms of vaccination - we should now aspire to be a nation of testing, where testing becomes a way of life .
eh fug off lah, i dont want to poke nostril everyday .
i guess he oso doesn’t know what else to do liao  .
the incompetence of the task force is allowing the virus to run amok in sinkieland community
small eye jinx lousy la  
and the unlinked cases is sinkie fault .
he oredi worked on the booster shot schedule .
strict border control is the key, with mu variant that can make vaccine useless, even 100% vaccinated oso no use
can they look at israel  ?
nation of testing means a lot of pple tio and kena quarantine .
really is ccbpap
tsl oredi said once hit 90% all can forget wfh and go back opi liao , huat ah!
siao the test fking painful, ask us test so often ?
just go back to social distancing la force people work from office for fk
i think he would have learnt from the last time he openly mentioned that hdb flats are depreciating assets .
means he &apos;s the only one from that "must be a lousy school" loh .
bro, their assurance worth how much huh ?
i can buy assure masks three boxes for $20 leh .
damn surprised that he would deny .
bros, so many people and even vocie recorder software consperm it was lau lan wong &apos;s voice liao .
if he low profile never hog limelight give speeches every week, at least maybe no people can recognize his voice .
but every week in on teebee taking the mic, how not to recognize his distinct nasal voice wor ?
lw probably wishing pple will forget about this .
bros, not him meh ?
why leeporter leeport he got share in the convo huh ?
bros, not admitting that he said "must be a lousy school" isit considered lying in parleement huh ?
only 2 voices were heard la .
where got lw voice .
bro, banter is one thing mah .
but cummed out dare dare open eye say blind words to deny when question is integrity problem leh .

and huai the weird decision to study masters in tiongland ?
i legit pinning all my hopes on cheena oredi .
i will be spending 2yrs there to do my masters…hopefully can meet someone ;(
u only 23 and going to cheena .
u know cheena got how many chiobus!
knn 26 only me 32 how   
i reckon the correct age for sinkies to marry is about 30 .
maybe this is a good time for you to learn how to date .
good night to you and for your kind words…but cheena girls expectation oso quite high 
i was lucky enough to get into peking university .
so decided to go for it but due to the pandemic, cheena have restricted border access so bo bian have to delay my studies by a year .
i trying to slim down a bit to maybe sub-100kg before my studies next year september
i oredi in the club le ah 
one of us one of us one of us
just get into local uni masters better .
just get some companion there or go with friends .
own time own target .
 u oso will sian if your wife is a b .
then cannot divorce cos you want your kids to grow up emotionally healthy
not really good sia, i sit double decker bus the upper deck have to bend down…take mrt too .
these incidents show how poor the management is given how dead silent they are .
but i oso acknowledge that not everyone is as bochup as me .
and it’s unacceptable for the scammers to transfer all money by using one otp
the victims tio scammed cos they give out the user name and password so partial blame .
but ocbc processes is flawed .
how come it is so easy for the scammers to increase the transfer limits, add new payees and new accounts so easily ?
ocbc should make it robust such that it can sustain damage from usual password leak .
and the fact itsnt, ocbc at fault
yes, they are partly to blame .
this incident is not an isolated case, it happened to other banks but the fallout on ocbc appears to be more severe .
ocbc did not act fast enough, and failed to block the phishing sites in time .
why should you bank with a bank with lackluster security ?
there have been reminders given oredi but there will still be some people who will fall for such scams no matter what .
partially responsible bah .
nbccb yes yes yes!
in the past, otp was never implemented, the user only require an id and a six digit passcode .
those who think is ocbc fault are the victims  .
with great power comes great responsibility .
banks have been giving customers more and more power to handle their own account .
can liddat say one meh .
cannot be forever .
even flu jab oso need to frequently
else you will open another thread jinx the validity of the vaccine .
until the dominant strain change to another type
still only really respect one general .
winston choo 1st one .
iirc he refused to take up a glc job offered to him
he demoted meh ?
its ng jui ping, but he oso became chairman or director of some glcs/stat boards .
the one after him  .
ah thanks for correcting me!

purposely speed up when i signal to change lane  .
depends on how far ahead u are  .
nice guys finish last
signal light not enough la .
u must position the car to signal your intent oso ma
sinkie drivers got ego problem one
you signal your intentions early and they take advantage of the situation .
they speeds up so you can goes behind them .
i more dulan those when i signals liao, they keep paces with me, and in front of my got one car just like to cruising there .
liddat lagi kena stuck .
at least if the car on my next lanes speeds up, i can fasterly zips out mah .
literally if you go see, every ministries almost all got create new post hire new staffs .
huh liddat means current civil servants more relak as got extra manpower .
there are more than 100,000 sinkie who are in working age now unemployed .
this is the reality the younger cohort of people will face .
no saving, might not be able to finish paying for their hdb if they own one by 55, no min sum to satisfy ,no chance to enjoy their twlight years .
owning 2 or more properties for sinkie .
better than no job mah .
maybe he join the safe entry ambassador, aircon and beo xmm .
ah, sinkieland employers, the only people who can look at reality and say "no way, this cant be true" .
works in close relationship with our newspaper .
5k for fresh, wet nose graduate who needs training ?
means he see u and your coy bo standard la .
ownself buey gan don’t call others buey gan .
maybe knows the grad going to be his direct supervisor he not happie so secretly tekan him till he leave then maybe u all will promote him instead ?
cos he is not trained in reading plans and calculations to deal with designers of refrigeration system .
how dafuq isit still the same now ?
even ft fresh grad in moi company get at least 4k
why dont u all send him for training or he refused to be trained ?
actually doesn’t mean that he next time become team leader the lao jiao sup don’t dare to scold him or be rough with him .
the laojiao has oredi know all the workers and got many years of knowledge, this new jiao still need his advise and listen to him most of the time .
tell boss and pm of red dot  to raise engineer pay by another 3k
as a hiring manager, i &apos;d believe and take heed from this as much as i believe the  &apos;experts &apos; on 160th
maybe he just wants a year to yolo or even take a graduate course .
5k offer is market viable, there will be no shortage of applicants .
he found a better offer mah .
nowadays doesn’t pay to be loyal liao…
all my friends refer to 160 reports when offering salaries .
i saw you wrote 5 day week but how about working hours and any ot  ?

"even though our jobs were good, it was oso very stressful and very demanding," said santos .
we sinkies dont want that lifestyle anymore as well .
for every one of them that left, at least 3 fts that are stranded in their own nations cant wait to come here .
1 mossad left and villages of motherland will pour in, creating thousands of goo ld jobbs for sinkies .
if expats stay on edmw oso kpkb them
plot twist: mossad stay here 2 years finish collect all the covid wayang intel by the mmtf .
too many expat worshippers here lorr
can you stop asking questions that hurt .
these strawberry foreigners, a little bit of restrictions they cant handle .
billions of ceca waitin for angmo to give up jods
he oredi mentioned, its easy to travel to places from singpaore .
sinkieland now cannot offer that .
so they leave to other places lorr
cos kumgong sinkies and new citizens voted for the government they deserved
condominium u dont renovate oso look like **** mah .
renovation is key to making your flat or condominium look good .
sinkieland is "easy" lololol .
this is a word to decribe those, usually women, of loose ways, aka like a whore n prostitute .
how come all your post is promoting china, bashing western countries and now u insult sinkieland ?
why dont u just move to cheena to stay ?
why dont u stay on topic n stop imagining bogeyman .
these people see any criticism of cheena will immediately jump in and defend as if their life is on the line .
on the other hand you dont see such similar intense dedication when it comes to sinkieland .
in fact these jokers often like to criticise sinkieland government and sinkies .
most can oredi conclude these people are not sinkies and are either jhk or tiongs foreign agents stirring shet here .

height no choice but weight is something u can control for sure .
u can finish your degree going further studies so what is weight control for u right ?
i went to cheena for a one month+ exchange during my poly days before and quite like the place .
so decided to take the chance
but this type of thing takes time and experience .
i am pretty much an introvert  don’t get how people do fb live hahaha
thank you sir…i don’t like to compare bah…just that got this thought especially at night
ts, enjoy in cheena .
exercise a bit to cut down weight .
ts oredi has best outcome .
idk how true is it but some of my friends mentioned that they prefer me at this weight ?
cos there was a period of time that i skimmed down a lot .
(~85kg) and my friends say i look damn bad ?
ts is very well off physically already, compared to me  32yo 2/10 face buang buibui forever alone balding shorty   .

ts mai jjww la  .
heng all moi cc maxed out .
on a parallel thread got 1x case where $100k was taken, then $ was taken from her credit card via easicredit transfer or cash withdrawal ?
but these cc transfer normally takes a day or two .
but ocbc so nua until a few days later the cc cash went into the account and again transfer out to the scammer bank .
no blacklist the scammers &apos; bank number ?
the isp oso should be storng enough to not let scammers to sms me  .
liddat i pay 118 monthly for thier service for what  ?
they will receive my lawyer letter very soon  .
ownself check ownself .
so no blame culture please
cant ocbc stop the remittance given that is such a big amount and clearance of account to overseas ?
dont such remittances (big amount or clearance of account) send an alert to the bank &apos;s cyber security department ?
how come the remit is the immediate effect ?
cant banks reverse the transfer ?
cant a bank have a system like if want transfer big amount, it has to subject bank due diligence first (eg video call customer, video call the transferee) ?
my question is firstly how those scammers know these people have ocbc account ?
is to find the culprits behind the act .
they will come up with a more foolproof scam and claim more victims .
i think the laws are very lenient to these scammers .
ocbc failed to provide that service .
if you go counter ask for life savings, confirm will hold and kena questions .
why are there no checks for large transfers ?
oso i believe the no otp issue, cos dbs oredi kena many times liao .
going down the hierarchy of controls, ocbc should fundamentally implement additional layer of securities or upgrade its security layers before pushing it down to the users .
i no ocbc account oso received the sms
in edmw tradition, those who dont have much $$ in banks will laff and sleep very at night knowing pple richer than them are scammed and made penniless .
those few bbfas will blame parents not rich dont give birth
if the police of different countries can cooperate, they can trace to the receiving end .
someone hack into ocbc database .

rook at how many sinkies jin excited to serve ns and cant wait to sign on to continue motivating people, that will give chiu a good gauge of how good they are at motivating people .
who more powerful than him ?
screw up oso no1 dare to say he wrong and instead grovel to praise him .
i heard he screwed up quite badly in oz in one of his ventures
and oso if need fight war to govern sinkieland then no one will qualify ?
his wife lagi more powerful though .
can bypass watever protocols .
the earlier senior civil servants oso didnt have degrees .
took over public transport at worst possible time, tio stoned to death by social media, did not delete negative comments on his fb, just went to fix the problems
no need to try & fit into any private or public entity as management .
exactly why he got rid of him, why would anyone help someone who will eventually become his boss ?
typical sinkie pawn sinkie .
you still newbie in management la .
just like my ahseng supervisior many many years ago, he probably thought i will get ahead of him eventually,  that &apos;s why he act like a tyrant, always try ways & means to get rid of me + alot of other shet things .
no, the supervisor will never be promoted to an engineer cos he do not have the skills sets .
i do track the learning progress with the supervisor and the fresh graduate every week .
once the fresh graduate complained to me that his working environment is dusty, hot and stuffy .
i dunnid that reply .
there is a lack of sinkie graduates applying for the job .
that is reality, whether you believe it anot is not changing my company seeing her this july/aug .
that is why the company should not appoint some one noob to assume that position .
some one with working experience will be able to get along with the lao jiao and see through what tricks that the lanjiao is playing .
the lanjiao may end up giving the noob the wrong info to sabo him .
one local employee tender then oredi wanna higher from overseas ?

they oredi take in the money when they signed membership .
so, what are they complaining about  ?
this is how ktv cluster happen
haha you got see the facebook sinkieland quarantine groups .
all the complain .
tell the expat mai hypocrite la .
knn reuters one sided leepokting again .
so many ceca still leeching here in sinkapur .
have some respect for our sinkies both females or males .
there are many more important discussions to partake than this .
to ensure other angmor expats can get jobs in sinkieland ?
theyve zero loyalty to sinkieland .
all these so called news are released to time the real bad news release of data like jobs data showing sinkies are staying jobless and unemployed while more fts are given ep-pass to work in sinkieland .
yes, i can further hypothesize that the sense of entitlement that fts had developed over the years and especially during the covid period in sinkieland is due to the fact that pm lee had over the last 20 years  given foreigners super easy access to the good high skilled and high salary jobs in sinkieland as well as put them on a pedestal .
please send some nsf to protect them
the numbers must be significant until pm 3 speeches said welcome them .
only thambi ceca stays and bang bang
continental cars are liddat .
no money send car to workshop, don’t act atas .
conti cars are made to survive in conti climate not in this god forsaken place 
knn so many problems .
wa 5 yrs liao not much problem at all .
always see my friend complain on socials  .
those driving merc ok lehb
close to 3 years old car leh .
maintain on time should serve u well, not a question about conti or asian cars .
3 years old audi is considered still ok liao .
when your warranty runs out this year, and the clever german engineers have long planned for the obsolescence of mechanical and electronic parts, let us know how you doing next year (4th year) .
vw group didnt become so big by building bulletproof cars that dunnid repair, replacement and maintenance .
u should google the issue, its a design issue not maintenance related .
except for wear n tear la .
as long as your piston rings age and get carbon, etc .
not just that but the workshop will oso hold off replacing parts that should be replaced until your warranty expires and they can bill you for it .
in my experience, never hold a conti car into or past the final year of warranty .
audi, bmw and merz cars can do away with signal lights function as drivers rarely use it .
sorry boss my car too powerful before i is signal oredi in front of chiu liao .
will the others whom are not affected be complaining about the delay in transfer of money ?
it should not be so easy for banks to transfer money else that will become another issue altogether, banks act on instructions of the owner of the money, the account holder should look after their own money ?
ocbc name is going to be shiat soon if they dont make a satisfying statement soon
bank gong gong just process the transfer of 100k from local to foreign account within minutes and not flagging it out
we’re in a ever fast pace environment that if we see urgent or in the mist of something we want to get it done asap .
if they could oso pay more attention, plus a little bit of tech knowledge .
my former managers expects me to be fast, even though i’m slower in mental processing
the banks can send otp to scammers, or scammers can intercept otps .
hope your parents get scammed so i can come in and gloat oso .
updates to a) terms and conditions governing ocbc paynow service and ocbc cross-border paynow service and b) terms and conditions governing electronic banking services – paynow default daily limit is now revised to s$1,000​ .
​isnt it a bit too late now .
ya i mean even if its late is like wut ?
u just reduce 5000 to 1000, got use meh ?
if another victim click on the phishing link in sms, the scammer just change to 50k limit and transfer  .
whose great idea ah ?
but if you are busy and need to get things done, it’s very easy to overlook the well planned scam .
how many and how often one does that ?
for urgent cases , large sum, account owner physically go to the local branch .
but moi no frens, cant scam moi frens if moi aint got no nothing
how to expect all sinkies to be it literate .

those coe conti cars might as well be brand new cars underneath the old skin, cos many of the mechanicals and electronics have oredi been replaced before or due to be replaced .
good luck to those people who want face but cannot afford .
etc diff story oredi 
heng moi drive jap car

ts no drive complain what
dont think got refurbish clutch .
sinkieland sure got people rich enough to replace parts like these
parents of the past would caning their children for not listening or against their parents with rotan but not now .
@wwenze how does it feel to share cool stories only to be debunked ?
just look at your immediate supervisor or hiring manager or whatever similar thing, cos that is how he will be a short while later .
maybe he see you as his boss he oredi half-sianz oredi .
dont even know how to use the [debunked] tag, later he do his job properly you oso say [debunked] .
he just stayed there to earn a month pay while waiting for a better job, or maybe just out of courtesy .
then they take over your role .
share oso 25% nia
maybe malaysians like you should be more appreciative towards sinkieland .
do not share too much cool stories to increase the fake profile of malaysians, especially fresh graduates .
malaysian universities are not particularly prestigious especially when they are from third world developing countries .
i will gladly hire a good malaysian anytime but if i ever see yours or equivalent csb profile, out the window it goes .
do not underestimate sinkieland engineers .
a ceca can do the job for 2 .
but add in dusty environment, sorry, i don’t want oredi .
cannot tahan dusty places .
he is a fresh graduate who needs guidance on  every step of the way .
touch your heart la .
5k is over pay meh .
if u got a kid and he got 2 offers .
30-6pm, occasionally ot, but air con environment and can wfh, especially during this pandemic period .
lol chiu ask o levels supervisor to teach a degree grad ?
its oredi a huge red flag .
if he wants to, he can go for courses at polytechnic and later at university .
be glad he left after only 1 months .
naos drives bus oso cans gets 3 .

they will not suffer or stay in a new job that they dont like at all .
she inserted her atm card and deposited a sum of cash in and receipt came out that it was another person (unknown) savings account .
my mom immediately went to the branch to clarify and the cso raised a form indicating "wrong transfer of account" as if it was my mom fault .
went back to clarify and confirmed my mom actually inserted her atm before she put in the cash to the automatic deposit machine .
but fact is my mom inserted her own atm but yet the money went to another account number .
was advice it typically take a month as they need to seek the person whom received the $$ to return .
such a big cock up oso can ?
hope your mum get the money back immediately
but can deposit into other people account ?
jitao report mas, uob will wake up their idea after tat
you ask here hoping the cso is a registered member here to solve your problem meh~ ?
system cockup sia
actually i think can be done ?
recently hackers managed to hijack otp .
you got read anot .
the uob guy said this may take one month to clear up .
if this is clearly the bank’s system fault then how come i the customer should suffer that kind of lengthy investigation period ?
must see cctv to see if really got key in another party’s account liao
so they will take note .
better double triple confirm with your mum before making police report .
deposit into other people &apos;s account wrongly is quite sop one .
somehow think this is a one-sided story .
i am oso thinking of going back to meal replacement shake (breakfast - lunch [shake] - dinner) .
i used to do that a few years back, but it was more extreme…i had 2 meal replacement shakes and one solid meal a day on top of daily exercises .
while i managed to drop to about 90kg, i was really unhappy and eventually ballooned .
i tried wooing a gold digger before…the feeling sucks and i didn’t even realised until my friend managed to “pull” me out of the hole
it is ok to worry, just try your best since you are only 23 years old still can get pretty xmm .
if you are 30 years old, you might have to start accepting some auntie-looking women .

im 25, ps i thought i was 24 back then, couldn &apos;t care about my age, didnt bother to celebrate my birthday at all, had dated 2 officially, 4 underground (means parent dunno one)
there are more sinkie girls than sinkie guys from government stats .
i am oso surprise why so many edmwers are unable to find .
you tried to do too much liao in a short matter of time, that &apos;s why you gave up and bounced back .
and do more research on compound body exercises which can help you to burn more fat and build muscles too .
rather than wasting money and buying shakes, focus on eating lesser unhealthy food and try to have a more balanced diet .
im in the same predicament as you 22m but instead, i choose to stay single as of now (probably in the near future too) cus of personal ideals .

i was looking through my ocbc sms and realized that i didn’t receive any warning sms not to click on suspicious links on dec 23 .
but ocbc said they send out warning sms on dec 23 .
did they really send to all customers ?
“ocbc added that it sent out its first media advisory on dec .
it oso sent out a second advisory on dec .

iphone / safari / chrone fault la .
how come never block the phishing website ?
maybe some suggestions of how to strengthen .
after they strengthen, some people will write in to say too many layers of protection, cumbersome process, can banks look into simplifying .
overseas addition of payee should have a 24 hr lockup period before money can be sent .
is not strengthen everything petty sum like under 100 dunnid strengthen .
needles never poke their flesh so they won’t field pain

actually i know of one such person irl .
he thinks he wont get covid cos he hikki at home lorl
jio mod 7pm tbp tonight .
oh then its prob the old staff making life difficult for the grad so once he resign can keep his rice bowl
maybe is how we worked that got him scared .
i do not really expect him to be a hands on person but in our field sometimes even the directors go down to site to teach the technicians how to clean the parts and troubleshoot .
 probably it was the unspoken expectations that we displayed .
now many engineer grads all upskill and jump to do software engineer/data analytics liao lor .
limpeh alot of friends(chemical/mech/electrical/aerospace engineering) liddat de .
no computer science background oso can go ncs/dbs/dsta and code .
all these coding jobs pay 4k and upwards, sit inside cozy aircon office, got career climbing prospects, and lesser office politics .
engineeer company need to up pay to attract/retain engineer graduates la .
sinkie grads can tahan hot weather, but not with mediocre pay .
if he were paid better would he have stayed ?
i got logistics cert can become engineer ?
job security mah .
maybe my mistake .
why cant you get a dip holder for it ?
the position of an engineer is suppose to manage the team of technicians and at the same time read plans, vet designs for new refrigeration system .
most likely he is the reason behind the engineer &apos;s quit .
we had an engineer managing him for a very long time .
even with the shortfalls in engineers, he cannot take on those roles .
u hire ahbeng or snek maybe got chance
+1 to this, i have some army friends who studied civil engineering & i would say about 70% have left or are leaving liao .
oso the lack of regulation of the term  &apos;engineer &apos; .
in europe only those who graduate from engineering schools - often 5 years - get to call themselves an engineer .
here there &apos;s no such regulation, only for those who become pes after a long while .
so anybody becomes engineer & the job scope oso becomes more of a supervisory role than actual engineering .
if threadstarter is really serious about trying to hire cheaper local engineers, and foster the local engineering scene, and actually has the power to hire people, why not ?
and even the basics you can learn from internet nowadays .
lky had the right idea with the poly system and limited uni intake .
however if threadstarter is working in a big company or mnc which has a rigid employment structure, like for example engineer-1 must have a degree, then llst, that one i oso can understand .
(and you can learn enough of it reading audiosciencereview anyway lol) .
and the problem with engineering prospects in sinkieland is that, even if we study advanced calculus, there is a lack of high-paying jobs requiring advanced calculus available here .
year 2021 still got unspoken expectations ?
close down the coy la ts .
but when it comes to training you can come and tell us unspoken expectations ?
maybe if contract got put "+s$500 to salary for every unspoken expectation that employee has to face" then he might have stayed on .
unless we are looking at the short term, actually polytechnic skills is insufficient for the growth of the company .
me too i got bona fide science degree from nus .
6 day work week 12 hour shift can tahan no problem for s$3500 .
aiya, why limit them until liddat .
just hire a dip holder for a fixed term and see how he swim or sink .
just like my current job, they want simi master in it with 20 years experiences in enterprise db management + ai, in the end, i just sit there and watch that stupid monitor for error .
unless you have a lot of time making friends with workshop owner .
it seems like audi sedans got more issues ?
5yr q5 no issues with regular maintenance and quite fuel efficient too .
so is it oso due to driving style ?
typical conti problems are oil leaks, gearbox, engine parts like the injectors and ignition coils .
add up easily more than 10k to replace .
not so many electronics .
e65/66 oso not bad, can last .
f01/02 and f10 turbocharged era onwards with tons more electronics, air suspension, electronic self leveling system and stuff, can forget it .
for conti turbocharged cars, it comes even earlier cos of the relatively high wear and tear compared to lower powered and lower load on n .
volvos a lot made in tiongland now .
got jaguar, land rover .
made in england, check for new strain covid
to be fair, all those award-winning german engines of bmw and vw are technologically advanced, efficient and powerful .
so just buy new, sell after 3 years to 5 years, and you wont regret owning one .
simpler design, compound with local dealers stripping out as much as they can to lower omv .
audi needs to churn out cars fast enough to grab market share mah, now bmw oso lost to audi in terms of market share .
buy old 2nd hand car complain so much .
hemg moi i only bmw(bus mrt walk)
classic edmw thread .
where all the jap/kr car owners start their argument with i-drove-a-conti-last-time .
fkn arm chio  .
rl quite diff hor ?
maybe makes sense also, since jap/kr drivers tend to be a budget sort, whereas conti tend to be more willing to spend to upkeep .
so those making noise people are those who from one group but jump to the other group unsuccessfully .
bo lang support ?
a master student with rich family is oredi half a battle won .
but due to the p2ha i sorta of lost my momentum and am trying to get back .
i typically do one hour on the treadmill .
my plan is to do as much cardio as possible before switching to weights to build strengthz
i know that i have a lot of opportunities that some others might not have and i am grateful for every single one of them .
i think someone in this forum did ask about doing this as a single and how their parents will view it .
ok, can try walking outdoors, hiking etc .
anyway, dunnid to look for love now la .

its a proven formula .
so little where got full ?
if i order chiu kuay, i will always ask for more chai  po .
i guess that can be the way to do it .
 outsource to mumbai la, see what you get .
they all add up eventually and now you have people losing their life savings cos the whole thing is so intricate, it’s hard for the general population to discern .
every agency says it’s not their fault, sinkieland government does nothing about it .
should have an act to sue the outsource coy .
they have such capabilities on internet banking front end, recording of the personas for every individual *this includes geo location as well as transactional behaviour .
and, by right it should be blocking if suddenly a foreign ip is detected logging in where the actual personas of the individual is always in sg…:: .
the lapse here is why it is not working/turned on .
these days its all stp, unless its manually track which is expensive
banks can even check it the new xfer receipt is totally new never seens before .
ask for confirmation .
if the money is mine, its definitely ocbc &apos;s fault .
if ocbc pays me to defend them, its whoever they think is their fault .
while ocbc could have been more proactive and done more to safe guard account holders’ interest .
the weakest link is still the one holding the phone .
these cases account holder literally did nothing and can do nothing .
those who click "no" will get scammed soon and cry
tried 30min again, dbs had oredi blocked the phishing site, i dont see this happen to ocbc .
e banks can definitely do more .
kinda like its  an act of sabo .
like somethin &apos; where u didnt do it but got accused of
it takes 2 hands to make a clap
the only thing weak is sinkees,  cannot do anything .
just koe how to comprain & go bedok reservior .
can they at least waive off the $2 admin charge if the bank balance falls below the min requirement ?
dont worry, the bank will send lawyer letter to the receiver if money not return within 3 days
pester them every 3 days la .
cannot let them take 1 month .
this bank is very wols and lousy one .
take it as lesson .
deposit and open eye check account number properly next time .
hence why, never let older folks to such stuff unless its online, at least can zoom in to see the process .
and those bank tellers, techies and front end developers oso la, use so bombarstic engrish for who   .
smelly trick like those axs payment machine lor .
key in liao then purposely go out of way then one blur f go use and tio liao
scary, is that atm kena hacked
yaloh, if got insert own atm card but $ .
got cctv oso got atm log mah .
otherwise just issue lawyer letter to bank .
for dbs, we cannot insert the atm card if the previous person left, but the atm hasn’t ended the session .
if it’s the same, then cctv should be able to prove your mum inserted the card, hence should not deposit money into another account .
wa this is spectacular
but of course the receiver can play the game if knows how to .
i wont advise how .
lol no lawyer will stupid enough to sent to bank
u go ahead and send wrong people and try lor .
if it is an offense , i will just abuse it and sent to anyone i hate then call police liao lor .
never double check meh ?
i thought normally will ask u to confirm
of course i did the correct thing and exited for him and chased after him to get his card back .
i oso had another experience lately, where a gal left a few notes behind after withdrawing .
people dont get tempted by such silly things, these are all offences if you retain/withdraw something that isnt yours .
peole use $$ buy the parts, pple pay for the power as well .
haha wasting power .
then gaming not wasting power ?
personal entertainment not wasting power ?
talk about environment etc, how about smoking ?
pollution + die of cancer etc .
drunk drivers kill how many oredi ?
drinking got any health benefits ?

when can we have dine-in at restaurant, food court, hawker centre, coffee shop ?
14th june or never again ?
sick and tired of dabao .
heng ts not scrabby else sure tio jinxed
isnt dabao the same as dine in .
just dabao and go is the best .
i hope lawremce womg extend the dine in ban until august
 after awhile, nea may forget they have a thing called return your tray .
gobment say will review and not confirm mah .
scarly, increase 5 pax but no dine in how ?
government never provide free mask that can be use while eating one .
cant wait to go coffeeshop jiak huazai roast pork 
as long got unlink cases, please dont be foolish to unwind p2(ha) measures .
will require more tightening and more suffering time later on  ?
ts is silver serpent anot ?
cannot say ocbc faultless .
kena nearly 500 scams in 1 month but act blur meh ?
disgusting elites helping themselves get richer .
businesses like ocbc take advantage of the lax regulations .
prob that time is holiday period even it pangkang so took so long to block that phishing site
ownself click on some random link is whose fault ?
my transaction all fingerprint only, and i only use the app, never in a browser .
as much as i think the victims are at fault but bank oso cannot escape its responsibility
people notice money transfer out call ocbc but no-one pick up n stop the transfer is ocbc fault .
money gone due to we call them but they unable no response so conclusions is ocbc fault .
 but the incident response by ocbc clearly shows that it is not up to par    
ocbc just has very poor security protocols in place .
if all the 400+ cases occurred within a very short period, then bo bian, not really much ocbc can do .
but if the scam has been going on for quite a while, ocbc really should have done something earlier already
no, it’s always ahtc fault .
last time there is a official ocbc member in edmw .
dunno why haven come out edmw clarify yet ?
edmw oredi do the poll for your bank .
can see pple not happy here!
your boss still dont want do anything ah ?
partly to blame
knn 23yo still young la, im 32yo never had girlfriend before
actually, getting a girl is not complicated .
for the rest it takes work .
but if you want it enough you can get a gf, or at any rate a girl who &apos;s genuinely into you .
marriage is another story .
auntie staying home everyday waiting for my handsome oppa to one fine day drop into my home only .
make me feel like a playboy, play around with different girls, but dont feel pain when i break up .
being said, i told myself not be so hopeful, can find jiu good lor, if not life still goes on .
oredi know what type of girl i like, in terms of characteristics & personality, parents & friends can accept & acknowledge the girl im dating, able to cook & keep fit is +1
then when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired, this is when you know you are ready to settle down .
this is how you know she is the one .
there is one more important reason .
when married, you will be more determined to never look at another women again .
after all, you have oredi "been there and done that" .
you know how it ends .
many married men philander cos they married their 1st or 2nd gfs .
this is how marriages break down and how their children suffer .
she can suck my helium gaogao
ask friend intro girls oso can .
what you have severely omitted is that this group of girls are statistically unattractive by proportion to the entire dating pool of girls available 
go hr can find le .
most likely will tio hiam by them .
just take time ah .
most importantly, dont be too despo ah .
no single mothers and above 30 peeps
80 percent wants the top 20/5 percent mah .
in tinder, its all about looks mah .
never about your personality .
23 is still young sia why so emo so early ?
i personally do not use any dating apps, but i know people who have found long term relationships on them .
so imo, it’s not the app, but how you sieve through all your scammers and nonsense people who are wasting your time .
since you’re still studying, it is probably much easier to forge genuine friendships in school instead, then see if anyone can click with you and can develop to be more than friends .
this is oso why it’s much easier to find relationships in schools than in work places, since the latter oso has more politics and individual competition .
that being said, there are people who have oso found love in workplaces (non-cheating case) .
put yourself out there, take the risk, be vulnerable, and play the game .
you have a girlfriend leh!
but recently, she found out you are seeing 2 ladies name pfizer and moderna, and girlfriend feels sad leh .
u wan which girl to like u
parents being able to feed them is one of the reasons, the other is that they know life is too short to be stuck in a job that they would be unhappy in .
working and work-related activities take up at least 1/3 of their day .
notice period is one month or 3 months ?
only toxic people can thrive in toxic environment .
like how gut bacteria can thrive in the rectum .
he local anot got gone thru ns anot
just need to say or show how tough or bad the environment or the job itself etc, will have lot of shts or whoever difficult work with etc .
if the person lacks of experience anot his preference to such working style or people, ya most likely he wont waste time n zhao .
best way is tekan till the new guy cmi and auto leave, he will be the last man standing and who knows he will be considered to be promoted and take up the higher role when you guys cannot find any better candidate .
just ask your boss post on jobstreet la .
5k salary alot fresh grade and even experience sinkies will apply .
last time my company post within 2 weeks 80++ cvs came in  .
must state first mah .
own conti before, if not how to join the conti bash bandwagon ?
but only can afford sibei old conti .
only one rule: .
yup as cars get older or have more mileage .
 can switch to slightly thicker engine oils if notice oil consumption going up,if not planning to overhaul .
these oils may form some kind of a plug effect to narrow the leak but not always 100% .
inbefore top up a bit for .
my previous audi drive 10 years until scrap no major problems leh, just wear and tear replacement and tighten engine mounting .
see luck and how u drive
however, i go back jap just so i can buy super big item .
the feel of torque and speed when you step the accelerator .
na jap cars cant compare .
still cant kick the habit of the  step accelerator torque and speed expectation .
now i step nia .
can hear engine zrooming sound very nice but car no move as expectation .
doctors that fear no work life balance
dunno how to make field hospitals ah .
maybe they lazy to watch over so many measures .
pinoy doc must be thinking heng he kena fired from his job or else now he have handle all this sheet 
could it be the ratio per population is low in the first place, especially for icu ?
can talk about everything in punggol .
here nothing good has been said about punggol leh .
you know punggol got rental flat ?
not at kovan meh ?
no wonder i can’t find after up and down
end up i ate lasagna in punggol again
all playgrounds, basketball courts overrun by ceca
not that true la .
alot of low ses strawberry staying there .
got the sinkieland canal of venice .
oredi sold the lous bto low ses place and moved to town
punggol is the son of malaysia
take medicine first then you realise you still living in your parent house
1) a lot of entry to mid level (5k to 15k per individual) white collared talents staying at hdb in punggol .
2) there are company provided buses from punggol to cbp for a number of banks and tech companies .
3) with the upcumming tech park in punggol, you can expect more delta talents .
we are cecapore, cecawhoreans
u need humans to eye ball manual transactions ?
operations budget are very tight .
can see results are like pappies vs oppo erection .
mummy &apos;s fren just comed over and she buyed a gift over, telled us we can unwrap now and eated, then moi unwrapped and sawed its ferrero rocher chocolate, jin disappointed  
ferraro is low ses auntie buy one .
now is give royce, godiva and laderach
got ferro better than none
still a decent chocolate treat
moi neber heard of this laderach brand before .
means moi is low ses ?
huh beri good liao leh
… your mother friend got dotter ?
every 5 min got new stupid thread
i always offer that to my relatives .
got rocher to jiak still better than me  .
me jiak 4 days old ang ku kueh
damn low crass…
can dont give you anything
i got use uob deposit machine i oso catch no ball how is this possible .
if you exit take out atm card the receipt is ejected and the welcome screen shows liao .
i really catch no ball how come the previous user’s account is retained in memory .
old people are forgetful .
check see the money is send to india or .
old people might have blur blur keyed in wrong option but explained to son otherwise .
happen many times before .
if take out atm card means logout, it should never happen .
i can’t imagine what other innocent error could happen .
recently got overseas buggy telco allowing sms to be diverted for fraudulent credit card charges .
criminals are getting more and more sophisticated .
you can key in other people &apos;s account number .
but pretty sure with atm card inserted it would be a system error for another account .
ps: uob automatic deposit machine dunnid pin number to deposit cash .
my guess is on their end they oso don’t really believe your story
cctv/transactions for banks there s a law must keep for 6 years i believe .
ok so once you did a genuine mistake, that one can kao tim, but repeatedly do it ?
but he knew how to answer .
he escaped the charge but it was just a one off and the amount wasn &apos;t large .
but you can take some time to return it .
but large amounts no excuse .
grab went to wrongly credit 250k into a guy &apos;s account, he act blur refused to return even a bit .
he was later charged .
sentences will depend on amount, 250k will easily get a year or more .
how can this be possible
cannot be put in own card & key in own pin and money goes to another person &apos;s acct .
unless is during deposit ts &apos; mom went to choose deposit into someone else &apos;s acct & manually keyed in that person &apos;s acct no .
cannot sinkieland banking laws make it clear must keep for a minimum no of years and if no reports then only can delete/overwrite
kyn my own user name and password, keep getting into other person account .
login again and it displays other people account details .
i am not surprised, but come to think of it, we dont exactly know how this covid virus is spreading, on the surface that have been contacted ?
no one knows for sure what kind of evolution the virus is going through .
he was wearing mask in preparation of the noodle and take off mask after packing,  there is no one around oso .
bro, look carefully, the one preparing and the one packing are 2 different person .
people are doing whatever we can so that this pandemic can be over .
it only takes a few individuals to spoil everything .
please report it to the relevant authorities
i see the local or don’t know msians or whatever eating inside stall .
i oso saw the indian chef wearing mask but liked exposed underwear see his nose n beard .
i think is sinkieland indian .
they should be sitting at customer place to eat not eat at their station
haiz, all these cant be helped .
this one is a little too blatantly doing things .
youncan see from his other tiktok videos, the number of people he mingled with during his off days are .
i am not against him meeting up with people and shooting tiktok videos, but he should do it outside his workplace whereby the products are being supplied to the masses .
which authority to report to ?
arrest, cane and deport .
alot of people go toilet pang sai no wear mask
the repercussion will be very great if he somehow has contact with the virus somewhere .
he can do it once, cant guarantee that he will not do it again .
oso not cooked food leh .
aiyah ever since mask wearing became compulsory, i have even seen it in restaurants .
chiu all dont be a poosy .
that why asians more inferior to angmos and angmos are dk .
got any serious repercussions ?
where can i buy fresh banmian liddat as a consumer ?
doesn’t matter which u blame when the root cause is the same
not moe issue, even if u gahave the skills, companies will lowball u
how u know is the salary kena low ball or just everything else over priced ?
u have people like lesson paying peanuts to get uni level grads and expecting poly people to know uni leveel stuff  .
in the past, the society was engineered so that there is no overabundance of of graduates or a group with certain specific skills .
all of a sudden, there is a shortage of skills/talents .
nobody should be blamed .
did you see pritam blame anybody yesterday ?
ceca has no authority nor any clause in it that can bypass mom to allow anyone to work in sinkieland .
u miss out landlord scream for rental income and property appreciation
ns for sinkies .
ceca will bang table and slap sinkieland if not allowing more ceca in
its proven that ceca allow more ceca work and play in sinkieland .
didnt our minister has oredi clarify that it is not the case ?
report liddat is proof that we are not letting them in as they like .
isnt that what they are for in the first place ?
then send your evidence to psp .
so that they can bring it out in their coming motion if any .
yes blame our education system for not teaching us how to sell snake oil .
some more he paid in full cos he wanted the credit card points and now he has to tell his guests they cannot go and then hotel refuse to refund or even upgrade the menu sia .
can kpkb and complain to authorities .
so long as service not performed can refund
jin satki hotel

my limit only 2k nia

smart ones don’t even hold banquet .

the hotel is a quite atas hotel in orchard area sia .
he oso kena stun when hotel say no refund or upgrades  .
maybe can, but my monthly not high la .
why cant refund ?
if is uob just be happy they never ask to take more money from you
or dabao the food and pass it to others .
tiagong hotel cannot make this arrangement .
wa when he call me today to say i cannot go he sound sibei sad sia
dabao the food give to dormitory
near basketball court in front of punggol plaza .
basketball court has chinese playing on one side, the rest all ceca .

all cannot make it
my flat in amk reach 5 years  .
my brother getting a new unit  .
many people are in relationships or married cos of companionship .
but i think your view is severely flawed .
i was never single since 16 .
i can tell you they can easily find better looking and richer guys .
in fact, dont flame me, my problem is the opposite of many here .
too many women .
up until a few months  ago, there were 2 more ladies that crossed my life .
very attractive ladies with no lack of suitors .
cos (decent) ladies are more attracted to whats inside a man .
no offence, if you cant eat sweet grapes, i can understand you will say the grape is sour .
there will always be many types of products available .
so you conclude that "such girls are statistically unattractive by proportion to the entire dating pool of girls available" .
the truth is, if you know how to polish whats inside you, they will come in the truckloads .
maybe convert to bi, then got more choices to find ghey oso lorr
you want date me anot ?
moi 30+ yo still havent hold hand or pika before, u kiasimi ?
better be prepared for next 30 years of singlehood n focus chiur energies on other things
if you are scare of free weight, even the machine ones oso will give you result .
then u will get a gf
you think people who are attached or getting married found love ?
50% of marriages cmi, the remaining tahan each other .
you will never fulfill your full potential .
hospitals all collapsing now, cant deal with imported cases also
sinkies gg this direction isn’t it .
if they believed it to be endemic, surely they expected people to get infected right ?
the government stupid lah, covid local cases still on the rise yet wants to go ahead open to tourists .
prostitute sinkieland still dying to spread her legs
its a bad idea , deltas is beri strong
anyone with a brain knows it will fail from the get go .
meanwhile sinkieland government want to live life like endemic .
countries that don’t take covid seriously should be dealt a lesson they will never forget .
so it covid numbers never come down countries remain shut forever  ?
yah lor i dont see any alternative if your economy is dependent on tourism or intl trade .
they dunnid any pilot program if they study our imported cases .
“put in place a temporary ban on tourists leaving hotels” .
lol simi lanjiao, local population got spread, tourists end up getting shafted ?
all ceca chiong there with fake vaccination certs ?
sure will make sure the healthcare system there collapse .
as part of efforts to enhance the international exposure of our students, the youth interns exchange scheme (yes) was jointly established by ministry of education, sinkieland and the ministry of human resources and social security (mhrss) of cheena in october 2019 .
originally scheduled to be launched last year, the scheme was delayed due to the #covid pandemic .
but we remain undeterred and the implementation agreement was signed by singapore’s ambassador to cheena his excellency lui tuck yew on moe’s behalf and mhrss’ vice minister mr you jun this week in beijing .
yes will help about 500 full-time students and recent graduates from polytechnics and autonomous universities from sinkieland and the equivalent from china, to participate in overseas internships in our two countries .
our students can look forward to updates on internship opportunities in cheena on the yes website (yes .
oyk, when he was moe, wanted to send kiddos to india .
another jinx project ?
to cater for sinkieland pr a legitimate route to go back cheena and never come bk ?
cheena is the best!
who in their right mind wants to do internship in cheena ?
our innocent buey gan youngsters go cheena to get makan alive ah
i assume you are an ethnic chinese sinkie so maybe you are not interested in india, but how sure are you that indian sinkies are not ?
cheena is where my ancestors came from, so i have some interest in that country .
   but you dont expect an indian sinkie to have the same interest in china, from a cultural and historical pov .
 it is only logical that his affinity is for chennai if he is a tamil sinkie .
sinkie girls scare go there, .
sinkie guys wont want their prostitutes .
go tiongland better .
can find prostitutes mls fls standard better than what is available from boss sam &apos;s stables domes
are you sure sinkiebu scared ?
 you need to mix around outside more leh .
 a lot of sinkiebu are now dating ceca hor .
 they work in banks and it together, and then love blooms .
the rest is up to your imagination what they do in the bedroom lor .
please lah, doesn &apos;t matter what race, sinkies will only want to go angmo countries .
cos cheena is no longer behind singapore, it is far far ahead .
of course there are still banana cheena haters who are behind the times .
can tell this is spoken by mountain tortoise who have never worked with cheena mncs
next time we go cheena work as coolie riao .
how come sinking girls scared to go there ?
thought they like dhalsims a lot ?
or maybe she accidentally saved another &apos;s account number by error and then deposited there .
but i forget even though i have 2 uob cards, i think uob deposit by card no need key in pin no .
but i forget if this is true .
never pay attention to such things .
a lot of people pull down their mask while talking on their phone inside bus or mrt .
scared stay at home .
very muffled talking lah
take their photo and send to sda lor .
i oso pull it down to hide 1 corner makan
eating not the same mah
yup, seen many times
u must be one of them .
i just take them off .
eating drinking dunnid wear mask .
brisk walking dunnid wear mask .
why need to do that leh ?
the phone mic can pick up a lot of sound one  .
so far office meeting many wear mask and talk still can catch what they say .
today one pinoy lady call .
i use alot of brain juice trying to understand what hospitalisation plan she talking about .
cos our mrt the world noisest, the system announcement repeatedly with 4 different languages kept over swarm normal conversation, u should ask authority mrt operators cut down the high volume long winded announcement from suspicious article to trace together bullshiiittt
heng i no friends .
huai never find out tooth and ask parent whu they voted first ?
how to blame moe ?
so how do uptron & spu got jobs tat sinkies would be qualified to do so ?
blame pap not moe .
i blame my parents .
i think if u trace back to the root of the issue then u should blame your parents
in before blame ownself
moe has a part to play too
blame both, so who is responsible for it
same reason why edmwers blame sinkie girls when their cog smol
ministry of trade and industry has a role to play too
on the onset of covid, during the glorious day of government declaring no sick no need mask, almost non of our food handlers wear mask .
no outbreak leh .
chiu tik many homebased food sellers got wear mask oso meh
those inside restaurant and hawker stall, the spread is contained within the premises and the spread can be contained and slow down with the trace together app/token .
can the bags of noodles be traced ?
actually if u walking around the dom at night, can see a lot of foreign workers nearby chillax not wear mask properly
those walking around the dorm unmasked, even if they have confirmed case, it will be contained within the compound itself .
if situation gets worse here, they always have a choice to go back to their homeland, whereas ordinary sinkie like us have to suck thumb and stay on .
waseh, want so serious boh ?
arrest and deport is good enough liao, still cane ah .
cane to give him souvenir to bring home ?
hr bo do work lorr
for that you will never know cos nobody will disinfect plastic packaging .
i saw one cook putting the meat ingredients in a stretch of bowls probably ard 15 bowls .
after that he stacked one after another put beside the boiling water container easy for him to cook for each order .
this is quite similar to the tzechar stall practice .
as long as they dont give you that bowl to hold your food is considered good oredi .
sinkies not hygienic la .
we are a cleaned city not a clean one
everyone please do it, if 1 person report maybe the authority heck care, but many many report, they cant turn a blind eye on this .
i have oredi reported .
day after day, ahmad risked his life to come to the airport with his family, british passport in hand – only to be left behind when the last evacuation flight departed .
now he and many others who hoped to be rescued face an uncertain future in the new afghanistanahmad – not his real name – left afghanistan after the us invasion began in 2001 .
he sought asylum in the uk, and eventually settled in glasgow, finally becoming a citizen last year .
when the capital fell, ahmad, armed with an email from the british government calling him forward, came with his family to the airport, in hope of a flight out .
now he and many others who hoped to be rescued face an uncertain future in the new afghanistan .
how many piece ?
tell you to unwrap and eat now isit cos goign to expire ?

then ask them dabao the other half and deliver to those not attending .
the rest 150 can be reserved and consume later

have to close down the program liao .
now these tourists go there hog up the medical infrastructure of the small island .
then what will happen to the islanders there when they kena the virus too ?
see how fast will toh .
can they seek oyk advice and guidance  .
fly jinx ong over to fix their mentality
iirc the phuket population rely mostly on sinovac vaccine  .
it really was for them, they think vaccine is magical, can mean covid-free .
actually hospital capacity oso not for politicians to decide .
its simple: get rid of the virus then open up .
otherwise you end up with this unnecessary unending escalating cycle .
should track death cases la .
no more thailand for the next 5 years .
heng i go thailand is to buy gold nia .

so this one is the prc students who take scholarship to study at nus/ntu etc, sign up to sexchange back to cheena for internship ?
cheena sexchange not so popular, but still 500 slots should be easy enough to fill up
whacked him harder whenever my character travels to **** land to face him .
best is can teleport to the back and give a good kick with extended legs .
jin songs sials can go cheena find atb!
i think once they experience the cheena 996 work culture through the internship there, they will truly appreciate sinkieland work culture more when they come back .
dont forget 1sgd is 5rmb .
the workers there are paid peanuts compared to here in sinkieland .
unless they are an expat working there at expat rate, no sane person will downgrade their lifestyle to work in cheena and earn lesser .
so i think is good that they can go there to know what a working hell looks like .
sinkie go there to work in bed nia .
free one who dowan .
 salary can be negligible la .
let’s not be narrow minded and if you have the opportunities for overseas work, please go for the experience .
just make sure salary, etc is right .
you will be surprise at the kind of opportunities you might get when you return .
go there tio lape n scammed ?
why cheena and not india ?
sinkieland has ceca arrangement with india no ?
if its cheena cos its the near future gateway to the world then why not "ceca" equivalent arrangement with cheena instead of india ?
it makes no sense that we import this many indian pmets into sinkieland and yet our workforce do benefit from india!
get beaten up then raped ?
go tiongland without tiong vaccine need to poke karchng for covid testing right ?
we could all learn a bit from you .
sticky 40+ never touched ger before 
5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill for overall warm up and getting your heart rate up is enough .
you need to build up muscle by doing weights training to burn more calories .
you can start with lower weights which you are comfortable with and slowly push to heavier ones once you can managed .

so many examples for us to follow yet we choose to do it differently
even if they dont uplorry from covid they will uplorry from poverty/bankruptcy
 objective of the vaccination programme is precisely to prevent collapse of our medical infrastructure .
 with vaccination,  just recover at home if kena covid
can always come sinkieland .
they should follow our lead to declare total victory and make it an endemic la .
exactly sinkies dunno how fortunate they are to have oyk .
the second coming of ah gong for us… .
it’s sad to see end up get quarantined in hotel can’t go out, cos i think they really don’t care they will just cheong everywhere if you let them .
if continue to open, sure a lot of people not scare die one cheong phuket until high death rate .
local hospital how big only, can save so many people meh .
between economy and human life, we witnessed the history has always chosen one side, cos no one can take care of you or your family forever except yourself .
if not open up, die, open up oso die .
open up and let the stronger ones live .
except that there isn’t any clear path to getting rid of the virus, is there ?
it will take the world many years more to (mostly) fully vaccinate, and even then vaccination doesn’t mean virus eradication (as we see in uk us israel etc) .
so should countries lockdown borders for another 5 years ?
must be too many piak piak right  
so … i see your plan is to close all borders forever then .
but im surprised sinkieland has chosen to follow that philosophy, even worse that many of our leaders have gone through ns .
do 1 time good one, then can go back bunk .
but no, have to make compromises here and there, airport cannot close, citizens can come back, end up we went in and out of cb achieving nothing, ha here and there and achieved nothing, daily cases still around 150 average, begging people to vaccinate even though 70% of the key demographics vaccinated already, while countries with 30% or less vaccinations have been open for months cos they bit the bullet and suffered for a while, now no need to care about vaccinated, no need to care about masks and distancing, back to normal except for airtight border controls .
if we close, and enough countries close, then all the closed countries can open to each other once everything settled .
yalor, why flip prata so fast ?
anyway i oredi predict that this will happen
can suucck thumb only
get the hotel to dabao the food for the 150 guest .
get the brothers and sisters who your fren will cut out cos of the 100 limit to then deliver the food to the other 150 guest .
oso get them to collect the angpow &apos;s for your fren .
actual intention is to collect angpow to cover ?
this is 1 of the reason why some people can have 45k spending on the cc even when the limit is only 10k .
want to get more angpow la .
of the 250 pax, how many actually want to go ?
wa siao he say now sibei sian need to call a lot of people to tell them they not invited .
will get them to respond
wa i ask another fren he say he oso not going sia cos uninvited  .
fwhaaa jialat leh .
but taking a huge risk when planning rike that wor
this type can only blame himself
ts got a lot of imaginary friends
couple got quarrel over this problem .
maybe the wedding won’t go on as planned .
but at least dont film ownself without mask .
ouh what a way to get lots of views for your videos .
preparing one with mask look like at or vk, whereas the one packing without mask look like jhk
no la, not my video la .
the one without mask is definitely not a jhk .
well well, whats done oredi done .
where got time for all these things ?
cant even squeeze through, that was the time when  &apos;social distancing - who cares &apos; attitude comes in .
how you know if this is a local factory anot ?

not really leh .
i part time driving grab wear mask whole day while driving oso very difficult, and i am not doing any physical labour as well .
1 man &apos;s irresponsible action may lead to the suffering of many many others .
anyway sometimes need to close one eye .
unless people are sovereign and whole day no wear mask, then that one must pawn gao gao lorl
some things we can close one eye, some cannot .
for this, if one eye is closed, the situation may get out of hand .
closing one eye is still depending on case by case basis .
they only say received my feedback leh .

from his posts, this is not the first time and certainly not the last .

basically repeating the mistakes of our forefathers .
ayia u see how many guys do treadmill on gym u know liao .
there &apos;s no such thing as converting fats into muscle, you need a calorie surplus to build muscle, to burn fat you need a calorie deficit .
you cant both burn fat and build muscle at the same time .
i dunno whats your body type now, but you &apos;re on the skinny side, just consume more calories with high protein in your diet, and lift low-rep sets with 70% max .
if you &apos;re fat, you can do both cardio and weight lifting .
some people watch too much tv, got preconceived idea of how love should be .

you invite people to go your wedding, they oso force to give angpows .
now economy oso not good too good and these attendees oso must have to fork out money .
if die die still want the attention, hold it next time after this pandemic has been eased away .
nobody cares one la .
marriage life oso between husband and wife only .
you can put so much time and effort to plan your wedding day etc, we as attendees, only go eat the food, look see look see, congratulate you, smile smile and we leave the place and go about our lives again .
use brain a bit .
so how much is he going to lugi ?
wa people suffering oredi still kena suan .
tiagong they follow the government regulations exactly lei .
but later mp asks him who he voted for
when restaurants cancel booking or take less customers, when airplanes dont fly, yet their staff and landlords are still getting the same pay, where is their pay coming from despite doing less work ?
believing it’s endemic is one thing, it’s another to have the policies and capacity to deal with it , especially with the low vaccination rate at the moment  .
i hear an echo so near sia .
this is a warning to our so-called endsimi strategy  .
ends it before its too late  .
so many examples happening ard they still wanna push for it…… vaccinated or non vac oso e same
cannot blame them la .
thailand too dependent on tourism .
go youtube watch pattaya video, entire town dead liao
many sinkies really think they are special .
if not for reserves built up over the years and the government can give some help, even more would be retrenched .
when you are retrenched like those in thailand, you will be desperate to open up too .
just cos never affected your own rice bowl, you say people stupid, really bunch of retards .
everyday only know of getting the government to give them protection via lockdown etc etc .
such protection cost money and cannot do long term .
put you in their shoes, no job, no money etc, you will oso be desperate for economy to open up .
fell and bloody smack flat on the pavement face down squarely now .
90 is their gahmen threshold, just move the bar to 200 and life goes as as usual 
considering sinkieland does not have huge pool of resources to spend on disease control and management like china, suffer-once concept will not work .
given that all it takes is for one mistake to slip through, who can guarantee new variants wont seep through the future border control once we open up for all ?
mass vaccination is the key to protect our population by statistics, 99 .
this is not a dictatorship cruelly nor ethnic cleansing, it applies to the general rule of the fittest survival, the weaker ones always lose out, in almost all aspects of life .
it took almost 5 years for ebola vaccine to get approved officially by the fda and is not guaranteed 100% safe .
i think we just need to be a little bit more realistic that even we cut the time by half, it will still be 2 years away until covid vaccine can be fda approved for x% of safety applied .
if we dont open up earlier, everything we hold dear now, our job security, handsome income, foreign investments, lower cost labour, life conveniences, will disappear one by one .
before the long term vaccine effect hits, let say affecting 20% of the population, the 80% of the population might run out of options to have a good life in sinkieland .
everyone will want to downgrade the hdb to get some cash in the pocket, we got so many 1-3 rooms hdb to downgrade for people ?
can you compromise on your kids study and tuition fees ?
sinkie needs to travel overseas twice a year to feel good, can still afford ?
mnc and local big corporations will hire older people over younger fresh grads for 5 times cheaper cost when the labours flood the market ?
even you are willing to take over our dear bangla brother &apos;s road work, the construction company oso cant afford to hire you at the salary you needed .
one small island oso cannot declare endemic .
we one country going to be endemic soon!
haven start oredi know the end result liao
who can guarantee ?
of course cannot, but that &apos;s not the goal .
the goal is to do everything in our power to prevent it .
vaccine is for the individual, contact tracing is for the community, border controls is for the country .
you can go on and on about vaccines, but its not choosing one or the other, all are needed, multiple levels of protection, cannot skimp on one and rely on another .
we have more than enough construction workers in dorms, still need how many ?
when the whole country is clean, no need to worry about their health, instead of right now where dorm cases pop up here and there, whole place needs to be shut down .
whats your plan b when you finally realise vaccines are not enough ?
plan b is if vaccination fail, will find some excuses to say that we need to continue working on more effective vaccines .
from here onwards, vaccination is oso plan c, plan d, all the way to plan z .
one bottle of oyster sauce can be used to cook many different dishes .
seriously lah, the problem is not about blocking out and not letting virus in, the problem is that as long as a country has to depend on others for survival, we cannot close the border .
at the deeper level, this is not how the viruses work oso .
you think when the patients recovered from covid, the virus is eradicated 100% meh ?
there are some left overs in them being managed by their own immunity system .
if time is right, the body is weak, the virus outbreak can happen again on the same person .
no matter how rare it is, remember, it just take 1 such incident to populate the virus back to the whole nation .
under such circumstances, how many times and how much money you want to spend repeating over and over again on tracking and curbing ?
not everyone like us and cheena when money not enough just run to the printing machines oi .
i oso dunno which country in the world only have local residences without foreign workers or tourists of some sorts .
the useless sia can keep giving billions to do nothing, we have more than enough to tank the problems for the next few years if we stop spending on stupid things like sia and businesses (who dont pass on any of the money to their workers anyway) and paying fines to the indian government cos of nonsense investments .
if we keep our country clean, we can open to other clean country .
i &apos;ve said this before, the "new normal" will be one world split into two, the covid-free world, and the endemic world, and i dunno why you want to choose the second option .
how long have they been chasing the flu virus, dozens of variations that every flu season need to guess which vaccine is suitable for that place and that time period, and still not 100% .
the covid vaccine strategy is praying that the virus doesn &apos;t mutate faster than the vaccines can catch up, but now with the added handicap of vaccine makers being stubborn and pretending their products can protect more than they really can, and subsequently not making new vaccines and having to go through the whole certification process again and again .
its this failure of seeing the big picture, always wanting to take the easy way out, always thinking about the economy in the short term, that has us going around in circles liddat .
mouth say only, open open open, but the reality is that everyone knows its unacceptable, ndp postponed, schools closed, dining in banned, dining 2, dining 5, dining banned again, bloomberg and other countries arm chioing at our fickleness .
 i can offer my services as exercise partner to her .
exercising with a friend is oso more fun, so i hope to keep this up and make it a habit .

if u gain 19kg during the pandemic will be covid lor .
not like some spend their weekend drove to airport and sneak into staff cafetaria and jiak ho liao .
all classmates say he is very friendly and soft spoken .
then one day he woke up saw his watch is 04 .
so he waited for her to class by , ask her to patch back .
when she refused he slashed her forty plus times n after she was motionless on the road , he took off the panties n lick the private part n took off his pants n tried to have sex with the corpse in front of public .
no one dares to go up and stop him .
sometimes smart people a bit siao
fast act than our multi-minsters
heng that time didnt manage to apply for the tickets
maybe this year got chance cannot celerate again .
if you &apos;ve oredi booked a ticket, you will be able to use it to attend the next istana open house event .
every youtube videos i watch the comment section got him .

i read if never do a thorough sanitised wash might kena chao goat cheese and worse tio fungus growth!
that &apos;s why moi kiasii aways standby dettol liao .
not many viruses can withstand 100 degrees celsius .
need to use mac on kukujiao thats why got mckukujiao
yes will wash thoroughly for hygiene  .
use saliva clean la cos tiagong saliva can kill germs too .
that &apos;s why after pew liao, must ask the girl to cum your lil bro to clean it .
if you pcc, then you ownself cum your own lil bro to clean it .
yup, my fb/fwb always suck/lick it clean after every piak piak session with them .
shiok shiok feeling at the head .
if one person is oredi infected .
just take a look at tfr bottom list  nearly all east asians .
most of them are reminded of the hardships growing up in a family with many children
different races in sinkieland have very different birth rates and going in different directions .
so whats wrong with east asian culture that create such low birth rates ?
his son about to ord but cannot travel home by himself ?
this audrey should be the one that wakes up her f**king idea .
god damn entitled snowflake aunty .
most soldiers dont make such decisions one .
ah boy dunno how to go home himself meh
btw, got book out so late meh ?
current generation is liddat one unlike those served in the 80s .
all damn satki one .
gxgx the son can officially resume the rat race after the "2 year behind" the girl of his age .
oh wait steel gotch 10 cycles of reservists .
those poor families son how to go back after 12am .
never hear this before when i surfed 20 years ago .
they dunno 2 years wasted meh .
2 hrs is insignificant .
bunch of gu niangs .
soldier la still need parents to pick up and complain ?
u think dad your father company ah ?
you havent come across ict release from camp at 2359 sharp on a sunday night in a god forsaken part of sinkieland one .
saw on tv, experts claim expect traveling on year end .
media interview one local girl who claim going to plan go japan and thailand this year end .
saw her house seem like stay at orchard rd one of the condominium there .
this one has rich high ses parent as support .
path oredi created for her
go dome l start listing can alr
she can be capable and like you work her way to success .
or she can just marry a successful spouse and take 1/2 with wc .
today &apos;s younger women can even explore "new" paths that are not open to males like sugarbaby and onlyfans .
comfortable good enough liao, dunnid to compare .
nowadays women earning power r higher & faster .
u cant compare gen y/z nowadays .
they got parents with high earning power
corporate job many ceca and angmo .
u wan them hire local man or young girls
during my internship in cbd, at the dua kee meeting between the head of each departments, moi notice more than half is zhabor .
you comparing to women ofcourse la .
women got so many options last time is gaylang now just do onlyfans or sugar daddy can easily earn more then an average salary comfortably .
mani dress sexy can earn more than moi lor .
standard on ig post photo showing some  cleavage who knows got sponsor come ask how much to promote  .
on facebook sell thing oso show some  cleavage attract people to see  .
do streaming play game oso show some  cleavage .
want to impress boss every day show some  cleavage make boss happy thus get promote faster .
zhabor earn higher no surprise .
the 2 year headstart can easily overcome the ns privilege pay .
husband just cruise thru life song song
female privilege in sinkieland .
you have to play mind games .
i try to justify my actions this way: before marrying, it is an open game .
i am exploring the best options for myself .
just get physical and go with the flow; bed her .
often business contracts fail to materialize cos both parties are too busying negotiating - and disagreeing - with the details .
this is the same for relationships .
why must one make things "official" or ask questions, and in the process ruin everything ?
i have asked a lady to "go official" in one date .
i never like this term official and can tell you most ladies do not like it too .
the fastest i got a woman is 1 night, or ons as they call it .
typically, it takes me 2-3 weeks to land a lady .
on the other extreme, i have "gone official" with another lady only after 2 years .
the intent was never to bed her but alas .
do not give the lady the assurances she wants (to keep her wanting more from you) .
here is another sad truth .
i never uttered those infamous 3 words "i love you"  to my girlfriend / wife before marrying her .
last part really meh ?
girls can be fickle minded, one moment can agreed with going out with you, the next ghosted u
by then too late liao
confidence is a fine balancing act .
plenty of other women you can meet and flirt with
later your wife see u in the group how ?
move on liao la
never say never, op .
b cups cannot, got tats cannot .
1% cannot, 30+ yo cannot,  hair not long enough cannot, got boyfriend before cannot, a bit of comestic surgery cannot, etc .
like almost everything oso cannot .
good luck and stay safe .
i think one the reason is our sinkieland pool is too low to search a mate, need to explore overseas liao .
quite impressive that chiu can be heypi even with painful imprint in chiur life .
moi oso kena stuffs in life that made moi numb liao .
sho moi cant be humourous or funny .
but this usually goes away when you encounter older women with more experience, they can tell you what they like and dislike .
when lao kok kok if you rich oso can get 18 year olds to sark chiur deek .
brother, how old  ?
it is a noble but yet un-executable notion to find a life partner without first exploring options, and at the same time, try to be "honest, sincere, loyal and plan future" with every lady you are with .
yes, you can label it cheating .
the takeaway is i was not married yet and every one is entitled to explore; in order to find the one .
i go in, with the intention of finding out if she is the one .
i do not do it consciously to a lady who has good intentions .
at the same time, some ladies just want to have fun .
you got to open your mouth to ask .
do not take rejections personally .
if the answer is no, you can tell yourself at least you have tried and it was not to be .
i have had ladies ask me out before .
so i prefer to do the asking, so that i can choose who i like .
like lets play mobile legends .
so got time limit ah walan
the interval u sent and del cannot be too long 
sent picture la .
like regret sending .
better dont send pics in the 1st place ?
dont tell me mackukujiao type hor
that’s cos you can only delete for everyone within a certain time window .
there is a time limit one .
after that time limit,cannot delete for everyone anymore .
heng moi use telegram
why？ u send your d picture to some one is it ?
but picture receiver oso can download save
likely phone issue or your whasapp &apos;s other parties have to oredi read your msg so the option auto disappear lor .
this one i dunno .
can set whatsapp photos to appear in the phone gallery .
never experiment before
in response to essential and front-line workers not having enough places to consume their takeaway food at, many malls are opening up their foodcourts and public places for this purpose (designated eating areas at malls, extended grace period at carparks, may 23) .
only one diner is allowed per table, which must be placed at least 1m from the next one .
by the same token, why not allow food outlets to resume dine-in service on the same basis, in addition to serving takeaways ?
outlets that are able to rearrange their seating into single-diner tables at least 1m apart should be allowed to resume limited dine-in service in order to supplement their takings from selling takeaway food .
this way, the impact of the recent covid measures on food outlets can be somewhat cushioned, while less takeaway waste is produced .
cheng shoong tat
i started a thread on this idea oredi .
and so did many here suggested this move as well .
this cheng shoong tat shud just stuff egg tarts into his mouth/brain
one diner per table will just diam diam and eat, not talk until virus fly everywhere .
should be liddat like having o level exams with some spacing .
if overtime got alarm sound until the diner leave his seat .
give it like 1-2 more months lah, should go back to allow dining up to 5 persons liao .
one diner one table eat and shout across next table ?
yes, finally can eat hotpot alone without people staring
actually, i oso think this is a good idea .
bbfa dream is everywhere can solo dining
moi is pay for girlfriend cai png niaa .
she testing if you are the reliable one but u backstab here .
change another gf
why you so beh kan ?
after come back cruise can write a similar to legendary shanghai uncle story
on the last night, still no piak piak, dont care .

did your friend initiate in the first place ?
wa cruise no piak piak, but sleep on bed together ?
is it a must to piak piak ?
cannot sit down and talk meh .
complain to the gf &apos;s mom ?
its not about just doing the right thing, it is about having a system that can replace the depleted resources fast enough so that the system itself can self generate to maintain the current balance .
one must always ask, what balance is this system trying to maintain .
hahahaha why never treat it as endemic ?
own bank balance lah
1) money can be printed and given freely and unlimited in sinkieland .
2) sinkieland can afford to close itself to the world for the next few years and reopen to see a world full of rainbows  welcoming them with open arms and sinkieland will just pick itself up and lead the world in anything  .
3) if it’s not affecting me, it’s not my problem and it will never happen to me
if vaccinations are not able to effectively  reduce the number of deaths in the event of new variants, no one would want to come into sinkieland .
these are still relatively unknown and is currently downplayed .
we oredi have free flow of goods and services .
 we are not as dependent on tourism as thailand and we have the resources to pivot away from this .
so the obsession is to import more ft and let their bf/girlfriend and whole kampong come in while we citizens suffer the consequences of lockdown and deaths ?
yalor, they must learn from our elite government .
i believe there is relation in restrictions in travelling  and mental health of people .
i know stories of people who committed suicide as they are unable to travel os - to do business or visit someone .
well its fun while it lasted .
where got house 220k so cheap ?

but one vege stall is so much cheaper around fruit stall, one old uncle is selling)  than the usually stall which has many customers flooding to buy from the stall (fat uncle wearing huge gold chain) .
amk 631 wet market opens very early one .

will relate to my mum .
ah soo mkt have better choices .
i personally dont have any except for a hospitalization plan for emergencies paid via medisave .
are those monthly insurance plan, e .
u can go read up  .
endowment, investment linked, others - only if you got spare cash to throw
can always go yolo mentality
must get hospitalisation, term and critical illness .
early critical illness and cancer coverage is depends on your family history oso .
got family yes very impt .
depends on how much you tolerate uncertainty .
insurance is pretty much exchanging the uncertainty of a large loss for the certainty of a small loss .
insurance damn important .
if nothing happens then you dunnid it - nay .
it all depends on individual and affordability .
this guy huat big siol
he in switzerland now .
sorry, is wang lei by any chance wlh relative ah ?
can sic the group ?
for me, my dad was a violent man with a nasty temper .
you see, the only escape for me then was laughter .
if you keep things bottled up inside, you will one day go berserk when the volcano inside you erupts .
cos no one cared about me, it was a comforting feeling knowing that someone up there does .
but before you get into a relationship you need to understand a few things .
you will have certain criteria that you think you will like to have in your dream girl but most of the time, when you get a girlfriend, you will realise that your girlfriend is nothing like your dream girl .
i know it is tough during this period where many outdoor activities are unlikely .
 joining charity and volunteering groups and events can be an option .
btw, it is a group for divorced / sexless marriage / troubled relationships .
i was 30+ when i had a failed relationship  .
went traveling (like an emo bbfa) and that was when i met my current wife who was oso single and we didnt expect to find love outside sinkieland  .
she is oso sinkie  .
and found out she and me have some similar hobbies  .
what you shared about getting women makes a lot of sense, from my observations and personal experiences .
i find there are a lot of single guys here who are bitter and its very sad because, there &apos;s actually a way out for them, as people like yourself and a few others have generously shared .
but many prefer to justify why they cannot find a partner, rather than taking the effort to actually change themselves to improve their chances of success .
just ended my first relationship .
in before edmwers come and ask u liao .
if i may speak on mly &apos;s behalf, i dont think he means that he is constantly  &apos;advertising &apos; himself to find the next better buyer .
but he can if he had too .
yeah good advice, just go overseas and do what you like .
but how do you know what is the love that he thinks he deserves ?
i am always planning something for myself .
right now , i am planning and still deciding if i should go to ce la vi at the month end .
dunnid to be emo about single
for me, once i get the vibe of being unwanted, i start seeking other options and try to detach myself emotionally .
not sure if im sick in the head but it beats getting hurt, i &apos;d rather be the first to leave .
some times, what appears to be a blessing - the ease i get women - manifests as a curse, in the long run .
you nailed the problem in the last para .
yes, many here are sceptical and cynical about women .
hence they conclude erroneously  that the problem is with sinkieland women, not them .
that gc i alluded to has 300 people putting the blame on their partners .
my hubby is seeing another women .
my wife displays no interest in our marriage .
micheal jackson said it best in his song .
the problem is always with the man in the mirror .
if you want to make the world - or your relationships - a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change .
you cant change the bbfa here .
but you can change yourself and make life sweeter for yourself .

sinkieland - sports programmes for children and seniors have been halted temporarily, national agency sport sinkieland (sportsg) announced on tuesday (sept 28) .
in a circular to members of its activesg platform, sportsg said that all programmes catering to children aged 12 and below will be suspended until oct 10 .
in addition to the suspension of activities, sportsg oso said that while dual-use scheme (dus) sports facilities remain open, users will be required to adhere to a reduction in number participants allowed .
for team sports like netball, volleyball, basketball and floor ball, only two people - inclusive of a coach - are allowed per half court, oso down from five .
for dus school fields, up to 50 participants are allowed at any one time, but they can only be in pairs .
for users of all dus facilities, participants are required to maintain two metres &apos; safe distancing between individuals and 3m between pairs .
sportsg oso reminded activesg members to ensure they and their group members are fully-vaccinated before booking any dus indoor sports halls, as a mandatory verification of vaccination record is oso in place .
you dont see ugly or fat people complain about discrimination .
its always them blackies
sometimes its not the color but their aloof attitude & their self entitled nature .
i isn can understand the frustration of these gheys .
the new trend that’s coming up now is referring to asians as urine due to the color of it .
ownself partner is ownself choose de, now chiu telling moi cannot choose ?
cos chiu will be offended its cos of chiur race ?
chiu die die huan force dem be wit chiu ?
everything oso racist .
cannot have preference meh .
while they themselves oso hiam 3 hiam 4 what  .
gay oso racist  ?
melissa zeh zeh ?
prostitutes/fls oso can choose clients, no say them racists ?
knn self entitled farkers
useless thread without poloboiboi and adam lambert
you have put it correctly lorl
im a ssfa auntie living alone .
i cant change my past .
at one stage, i churned women to hurt them .
fortunately that thinking was short lived and i snapped out of it .
as to the unstable relationships, i can understand you cannot accept such a situation .
this is not postulated by me from theories .
this is how the game is played .
you only get stability after you marry .
she can bail out any time she wants .
was so sure she was the one .
nothing hooks a lady more than a thriving romance .
well since we cant help the bbfas maybe we can help the ssfa auntie  .
no one has to remember anything the next day if they dont want to .
and maybe yours hehe 
in the end how u get your waifu ?
chop chop settle within 2year of courtship ?
if there is such a thing as official haha .
i only started to date when i was 24, married to my ex-wife when i was 29 only for her to cheat on me 4 years later .
trust me, the pain of that was worse than not having a relationship .
so young wanna get married liao ?
later age 30 divorce and get pawn by wc every month pay maintenance
but you got eat outside these 21 years right ?
this lifetime is all we get .
but u wan to court girls as a bbfa then good luck .
dont say u dont have choices as a bbfa u have but most likely u will end up as another average couple  .
the choice is urs u can change if u wan to change .
if not dont complain
i dont think i ever complained about being alone  im actually enjoying it .
im oredi planning where to go next at month end .
going alone most likely to ce la ve .
or maybe a change of venue at last min .
i was expecting step sister stuck in washing machine
others didn’t want to collect as they had oredi gotten their own oximeters last year .
temasek foundation have no plans to sell its oximeters .
those who wish to have extra oximeters, may consider buying online, from lazada, shopee, qoo10, or even carousell .
the cashier will scan and retain the redemption tab, and give you the free oximeter .
the scanning is linked to the warehouse system so that the participating chains know when to send top up supply .
if the outlet doesn’t have, or has run out for the day, just pop in to other nearby outlets or come back another day .
the prime supermarket folks have oso reached out to see if they could help with the free collection .
temasek foundation folks are working with them to see if they can come on board in the next week or so .
** didn’t get your flyer ?
these cases will be escalated to singpost for further checks .
yah, there are some folks who try to get extra oximeters to make more pocket money on carousell .
selling on carousell is fine - others who need them could buy them from carousell or buy others from other online platforms .
those who genuinely had a problem can called 1800 738 2000 to leave their name, contact number, and address .
for cases of non delivery, the folks will escalate to singpost to check and rectify if needed .
they are good hearted and thoughtful folks who are trying their best to help others wherever they can, esp during this covid pandemic .
**what will temasek foundation do with any balance oximeters after 5 aug ?
a small balance will be kept to enable exchange for any faulty oximeters up till end august .
the balance will be donated to moe for distribution to students, teachers and staff, in schools .
so don’t worry about balances with temasek foundation, hor ?
temasek foundation had been donating oximeters to places like nursing homes for seniors in singapore, and to other countries since last year .
so this is just a stay prepared initiative: .
- to familiarise ourselves with our own levels of oxygen intake so we know when to get help .
one lady did that, and was so happy!
replace batteries, and she took her own readings .
the next stay prepared exercise will be for disposable medical grade surgical masks, and disposable n95 masks .
after that, it will be another for povidone iodine (aka pvp-i) mouth gargle, which could be used as mouth spray .
this is currently planned for sep/oct period .
cannot just say local dont want .
please refer to our population ratio .
actually you can get online with free shipping for < $15 .
how would anyone want to make few dollars selling the temasek ones ?
an mrt trip to and flo to collect from any place would oredi cost $4-$5 .
ownself earn sky high salaries .
her entire family salary oso paid by tax payers leh .
don’t see her feel paiseh about it
earn some dignity, got wrong ?
if ordinary sinkieland folks are rich enough, will we have to resort to this ?
or only can buy high sell low ?
if house rent out, tenant can collect ?
die liao die liao .
carousell kena mark liao
those who extra not scare kena shame meh .
sinkies are always pawning sinkies
power is an infinite element .
when the old man was alive, where was she ?
if she was to place her son as the third generation pm of this country, it would spell the end of sinkieland .
sinkies really cheapskate .
if u have proper morales u can list it for $0 so people who need it can obtain it without cost as it was provided to u without charge either .
i’m sure the organisers can find a way to donate the remaining to needy users
too little power leh .
my current car oredi 6s to 100kmph and i find it low power
can easily stage 1 it to 230 bhp .
with the kind of body size and weight anything below 210 bhp and low torque is under power .
if want to buy e class, should buy at least e250, e300 .
a bit overpriced cos is a new model, but c&c does offer high trade in so the effective price could be just arounf $250k range .
moi favuorite chocolate bars is: .
awefully chocolate buttered waffle (60% cocoa)  .
just bought 100 bucks laderach choc yesterday .

those cmi jc or strawberry poly are the worst .
i remember most of the cb ns sergeant from there one .
ocs all the cmi leaders one and most likely help one another .
during my time they always claim that sispec is more siong than ocs .
not sure abt it cos i’m just lorwly cpl lorl
sispec/scs is alot more physical and training to work as a section/platoon .
occifer only thinks abt themselves
he use the wrong term la .
there is very few things the recruit need to huan loh after last parade .
no ocs one 40 yrs old
ocs quite nua one, probably the toughest part for me was rifle cleaning into the early morning before u are allowed to sleep after field camp lol .
very relak one lei .
u tell me tough ki lan .
even sgd cdo oso not siong one
their training not suitable for us bbfas la
ah yes, now that you put it this way, i can agree with you .
actually, during ns, being a sergeant/officer is a real pain in the arse cos you cannot just let go after last parade .
what’s the biggest heartland in sinkieland  ?
i am staying in 4room hdb .
omg $12 cannot afford .
well everyone loves it mah .
no one asked for apology either .
walan property tax so low still come here complain
i don seemed our pay oso up that much lor .
i am just pointing out your miscalculation .
inflation occurred yearly too .
with covid , many co freeze wages increment lorr

snowden, an american with conscience ~
the damage is done liao .
and cannot be like everyday go send people to say he liar and everything he say is propaganda right ?
he &apos;s going to slip up one day, then he will find himself forever in an american prison .
 the revealation of us government spying on its own citizens could be a guise to get other country to accept him .
spy world can be very complicated .
now there &apos;s people labeling him as a spy .
yeah, now rotting indefinitely in uk prison .
live in russia shiok meh ?
he how to live survive .
i think the russian will not trust snowden too .
he is there seeking a shelter, all it takes to putin to warm up to biden or whoever with the intent to bring snowden back to the us shore, snowden is a goner .
he probably still have cia secrets, thats why the russian are still providing a safe haven for him .
apparently there’s a different between something you have oredi collecting every month as norm, vs something you just started to collect it the first time .
dont say liddat la .
the reverse oso got where those people bought new item realize no use and give out free .
can see this in scratchback .
so is one rice feed all walks of live case, not all as cheapskate as bro thought one .
maybe its not sinkies ?
now sinkie core contains cecas
just give back some of our taxes and we can decide what is important for us .
saw one flyer lying on top of my mailbox .

the reason you write this oredi proves that you are not going to do something about it .
lament here lament there wont help .
sinkieland - getting a booster shot with either the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid vaccine further reduces the risk of infection by over 60 per cent .
those who had taken a moderna booster shot after two doses of pfizer-biontech saw a further reduction in infection risk by 72 per cent, while those who took a pfizer booster shot after two jabs of the pfizer vaccine saw a 62 per cent reduction .
he said that the health ministry had recently done a study on the relative effectiveness of pfizer and moderna vaccines as booster shots in terms of reducing infection risk, and compared the two combinations .
one possible combination is three consecutive shots of the pfizer vaccine (two regular jabs and one booster) while the other combination is a moderna shot after two regular doses of the pfizer jab .
mr ong noted that results for other combinations, such as a pfizer shot after two doses of moderna jabs, do not have large sample sizes and hence may not yield meaningful statistics .
mr ong oso explained why singapore &apos;s reported vaccine coverage of 85 per cent appears to be lower than the reported figures in some other countries .
"this is cos some countries report vaccine coverage against the eligible population, whereas we report vaccine coverage against the total population," he said .
"so if we recalculate this based on eligible population, we are around 94 per cent vaccinated .
it is one of the highest coverages in the world .
not going to get booster
why never study mm + p and mm + m ?
compared with 3 doses of moderna how ?
sinovac/sinopharm still trying to play catchup to mrna 2 jabs with 100 jabs of their own .
if u want to play it safe get p p p or m m m, if u want better protection but must accept more risk then take the mix ?
of cos this is not saying take it p p p or m m m will be 100% safe either ?
doesn &apos;t matter which combination to take, all will end up killing you .
if your body oredi familiar with pp or mm .
no matter what combination, died alryd means got underlying .
end up still will get even thought paper specs say until got hill got mountain .
so that big pharma can collect more data as the vaccines are still in the phase 3 trail .
my friends who took moderna all complained of much more severe pain .
not gonna die pain lah, but more pain than i felt .
but those who prefer lighter skinned partners are oso racist wat, why they dont choose their own same skin fellow 
dont like move on lor, why must kpkb online ?
i dont get it .
i always say ceca here will make problem, and as the number and power grow .
curryna huat am moi reading ?
lgbt oso want to complain about racism .
its the pot calling the kettle black
do you see anything peaceful in south asia ?
u cant even call them india anymore
cos for some dumb reason minorities cant be called racist .
and a lot of our younger generation are being brain washed by such thinking
gotta agree that its not abt racism, just personal preference .
latter still few & far between i .
i am totally ok if indians, germans , french, africans don’t want to date me .
then landlord state prefer certain nationality as tenant oso racist .
if everyone dont like you hor, u better look inwards
i guess it got to you .
simi sai oso racist .
this sjw nonsense getting out of hand
if u are not muscular with good looks and young, u will be discriminated
next time ask atb to dress up in wonderwoman costume n piak
seems her sword got thinner too .
this the siaolang that attempt suicide right
single childless can be wonder woman har ?
moi want to be batman
m &apos;sian influencer cathryn li shares photo of suicide attempt on instagram, deletes post shortly after .
so rich and chio and still got mental issues .
this one is fake one
or she got very good earning power  ?
thought she sweetside uplorry oredi ?
i prefer chocolate ice cream .
very good to eat those in sinkieland weather
moi favourite but need the semi dark .
moi favourite too .
but no more liao 
gone for how long oredi ?
the expensive ones that i can kope from others without paying a cent
ever managed to find in thai but think they discontinued .
not really a chocolate person but i will occasionally eat: .
ate few years ago and never look back .
but its really expwnsive so only once a while buy treat moi self .
chocolate origin not bad right ?
their dark chocolate cake and their soft serve
they can use cpf to buy one 2 room apartment and no more mthly, still own the place, can sell later but instead choose pay 2k for a rental unit to live independently from parents
good for landlords .
how many such people in 30s renting ?
heppi can riao .
those 30+ people still hope to merry wifey and apply btos next time .
wont waste their time buy a 2rm when single since it will only make potential zhabors hiam their low ses status .
better rent 2k condominium to attract potential wifey to piak and preggy for marriage
building flat is long term lease too
liddat then can support rental market .
i know someone who rent condominium while waiting for a bto cos his wife cant stand living with his parents .
lots of people with different circumstances la .
im not sure if you actually did the calculation of buying vs renting .
last year i checked (not now), renting a 4 bedder condominium is $3 .
ps: if you are comparing with a 2 room bto, then this calculation wont work though one needs to wait for a few years to get one .
35 years old + 5 years waiting = 40 years old then get to move out .
you have to understand, only those 35 years of age and above can buy a flat using cpf .
condominium got all the facilities leh
they happy is can riao
people got money .
if ftcan afford it why sinkies cannot ?
ib cant count properly no wonder degenerate to be an ib
actually less after adjusting for inflation .
my week long salary not enough to pay .
a few dollars to them is a lot of money .
actually  i oso never rent out leh .
so fast come in liao ?
it just makes you look like you cant do simple math
he told me many drivers returned their car to co (early retirement anot worth driving now as need as earning not even enough to cover rental, carpark and petrol)  .
37 million households in sinkieland .
low ses non matured estate leh
design getting worst
for the same generation, swift more chio and got turbo ?
the car in real, i fins it not bad looking leh
cos satki black vios better
85k are those few options nia .
wtf look damn fugly .
too girlish liao
i was just replying someone &apos;s claims that guys have to be tall handsome and rich to have pretty gf .
but hor, if you really want to hold my hand, we can discuss la > .
1) frequently working late .
she got pregnant a couple of months after our divorce was finalised .
lets not blame each other, both sides have their own expectations .
never suan lah, ask ask only .
you ownself know what to do can liao .
by the way never saw you for months .
nowadays got many guys use cutesy nicks .
but ya lorrrr 23 years old only .
any red flags before you got married which you thought nothing of ?
gotta agree intuition most of the time is right, something must have happened to make you think that way .
i very disappointed in u ah .
now complain you same situation as ts!
to be honest, there wasn &apos;t red flag prior to that .
9m guy in his late 30s that have not dated before no matter how much he wants to .
that is one of the trait people judge you at the first initial appearance .
shorter guy just look meek , weak and physically unattractive whereas taller guy are just much more confidence and attractive .
at least with dedication and hard work , weight can still decrease and can still slim down in the most natural way .
but for height increment , without going through the painful limb lengthening surgery , even if you have 10000 billions of net worth there is no way your height can increase .
in your opinion, guy what height then considered short oredi ?
your online persona really cmi wor
as long as your girl is shorter than you, its fine .
7 is alright ah .
lanjiao + lanjiao = smlanjiao .
cb + cb = smcb .
lanjiao + cb = lanjiaocb .
cb + lanjiao = cblj  
too many stories from both sides
cheena technology still the best .
chiu bo read cina or england properly, reduction % and effectiveness % meant differently
why cant they state every line in similar terms .
one vaccine says effectiveness and for another brand use reduction .
they just like to add a bit of confusion to the public
not so sure about how moh measured .
but hor, there are a few test groups in that nih study, the ppm and mmm ones, only 2 groups(1 ppm and 1 mmm) uses 50mcg moderna boosters .
did they check whether they get the correct data ?
all other uses 100mcg ones .
wonder about sinkieland stats .
then the same nih study actually oso hab test groups on mmp ones .
sjws want to control what you can say, who you rent your house to, and even who you date .
for a group that keeps calling their opponents nazis, they sure act like one .
i hope pap gets 99% votes and a ****ing strong mandate and biden forces everyone to wear 10 masks and take 10 vaccines for every illness every other day and eveyone has a tracetogether token inserted in their necks to track their every movements
soon one day they ownself create their own party liao .
these libtards are telling people you cannot have preferences or else you are discriminating .
curious if that gay an neh considered dating his own race though or did he specifically target chinese/malay men ?
ignorant youngsters are the easiest targets to be influence by such .
therefore, parents play a crucial role in educating them .
truths tends to b manipulated if too many people at the same time twist and turn giving it another name .
95% of racisms are actually just preference being manipulated by bad people to fit their evil agenda  .
then spg who pick only angmo is racist too ?
chao gheys jskm!
when comes to relationship is all preference .
if some one dont like durian you cannot force feed them right ?
or force someone watch football or horror .
preference la dood
next time even if ure not gay u cannot reject them i think
yeah and the same person probably rejects a fat gay bbfa .

after the germans began world war ii with the invasion of poland in september 1939, the nazi regime employed propaganda to impress upon german civilians and soldiers that the jews were not only subhuman, but oso dangerous enemies of the german reich .
