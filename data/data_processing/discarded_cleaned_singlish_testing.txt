parosmia is dysfunctional smell detection characterized by the inability of the brain to correctly identify an odor's "natural" smell.
instead, the natural odor is usually transformed into an unpleasant aroma, typically a "'burned,' 'rotting,' 'fecal,' or 'chemical' smell".
it the smell of the waygu beef lungs.

50th best team in the world ok.
if the rankings were upside down that is.
vietnamese netizens often regard sea as the 'bottom' area of the football world.
so the world cup dream still on?
same same but different   
same as newspaper?
they regard sea as the "bottom", but they themselves treat the suzuki cup so seriously and they celebrate their victory parade like as if the sea tournament is the "top" area of the football world 
but the 2 i have seen that are great are.
special mentions to baikakki and subramani whom i referred whilst they were young teenagers.
both are very disciplined.
but its between fandi and sundram.
skill wise and natural ability.
he was truly very disciplined and strove to improve himself and thus had a longer and more successful career than sundram.
so greatest that i have seen would have to go to fandi but best would be sundram.
viet should have some fatigue legs.
160th best team —> this sentence  sounds weird
not bad not bad, we are in the top 160
not bad, same as out press freedom ranking.
show off their condos .
isnt thats what social media is for?
bragging & humblebragging
true, but they could be more subtle about it.
you will earn their respect if you show off your condom and mistress on the social media.
wow thanks for iging.
show off my hdb back.
they may think they're being "subtle" enough to do it online.
if not subtle is do it irl.

after all he is maskless?
cos u scared he spreading virus right?
was at gp clinic to see doctor.
the clinic assistant did not force them to wear mask so nothing i could do.
other people die is not my problem.
u so eat full nothing to do?
though he has a mask but the mask was pull down to his chin leaving his mouth and nose expose and there a guy sitting beside him but was busy texting and listening to music.

buffet will be a thing of the past in the post covid world.
feel sad for bbfas
in fact, i missed all buffets.
its the joy of recee left and right for food that makes the buffet experience.
love buffets where they bring the food to you.
kids will probably miss the experience of running about checking all the stations.
cecapura is fked
fearmongering with words like impacted construction (bto) etc.
but who open the flood gate without strict border control?
im not concerned with those india indians dorm workers.
they are confined to work sites and dorm.
its those disgusting sp and ep ceca who mix in our community who will spread their disgusting diseases to us.
they always mention the low ses workers but dont dare to stop the rameshes frm entering.
if they ended up fixing the wrong problem in dormitories than in hotels, we will end up with more covid.
what is he talking abt
he mentioned that india indian restrictions will impact bto and construction.
they dare not talked abt high ses ceca
conveniently he left out ceca again.
covid has exposed several weaknesses in our ways of doing things.
meaning we need them back as soon as possible?
he is trying to do a zhuge liang stunt trying to confuse people.
those ceca coming in are pmet, not construction workers.
air tickets cost a bomb nowadays, those construction workers wont afford.
wa so long no see your post!
just sticking to my usual chit chat threads.
so much anger and negativity around.
more so than usual.
was expecting a nonsense karma thread, but the content turn out ok, fostering a good culture is definitely the way to go 
after i make her come then she will turn around and make me come
i like the new edmw moderators, very matured and with rational thinking, not like those in the past with lotsof ginna pis.
probably a good respite from oyk and ceca thread
my outlook and thinking before and after ns very different.
thish is the narratives of the entitled old unreasonable people.
sho long as i is not entitled and unreasonable.
and use quotes rike the above to justify old me being entitled and unreasonable.
confusion philisophy teach this.
but reality teach us the opposite is true.
just saw at dome 3 under vpremium.

you from which era?
20k per month where in reality mostly is 2k to 3k per month.
wanted to go with first paycheck.

if u need to ask this, your in the wrong thread my friend
what ts expect.

ts, have it ever occur to you why you wasting your own time on other people life ?
that is what i am doing now.
oh no ts salty again
“st retains top 160th ranking in press freedom index”
if he didnt score own goals, would we have been higher?
why are those jokers at fas still being paid for failures?
its been years.
fwa the ranking 
actually this is an anomaly.
a tournament they have qualified twice for and came close to reaching a number of times too.
a shade below south korea , iran, japan and now of course the aussies.
but their standard always around the reasonably good middle eastern teams like the saudis or iraqis.
wa same as state media.
sama-sama as our media
lion's ranking same as sph ranking  
this is a question of what could have been.
nobody exactly know the definite answer to it
coincidence that media and football are both 160?
must be oppositions fault for fielding a bad khan.
not meant to have this sport.
vietnam world cup hopes.
is close to 0% cos they are in a group where at least 4 teams is better than vietnam.
lion would not even smell the top half of the m league table post 2017.
better report to police.
let police do their job.
we dont have a badge.

doing the gestapos work for free.
u did the right thing.
i wont say anything but will distance myself from the person like he/she's kind of disease
don’t kpo go say the ft or offer them mask.
must do risk assessment first.
if you say them, following are the possible outcomes:.
they dont comply, scold you instead.
they dont comply, saying that they were brisk-walking, and may even report you for being racist or xenophobic.
they dont comply, and sneeze/cough/spit into your face.
they dont comply, and beat you up.
dont bother, you not sda
you’ll be arrested for racism.
even if you’re the same race
i scared they ask me “where is your badge?
i will not go forward to tell them, and quickly walk away.
think about it.
u wear mask is to protect others, not urself.
so they dont wear mask u are in danger, not them.
what for i risk myself to argue with those irresponsible people.
is it very noisy?
my condominium unit just beside lift, convenient and not noisy
surely not hp right
generally noise not from lift itself.
its the people using it.
technically if the lifts have loud "ding!
" sound every single time it opens/closes the door or reaches a floor.
high ses owner.
if yr door gd won’t hear.
but try not to pick unit near or worse facing lift.
my main door is the lift unit.
good luck to you ts.
lift not noisy.
unit besides lifts usually comes with central bin.
new hdb may be noisier cos of thinner walls.
depends on your tolerance and sensitivity.
in both cases,  i usually do not notice the lifts except when some rhino or bunch of monkey comes running out of it 
in my situation, each floor has 2 units.
i don’t even notice it.
autumn is near good luck to them
what at the expense of your own people's well being!
a sign of things to come, trading material for well-being
personal responsibility > lockdowns
personally if you ignore your well being there are plenty of activities that have huge payoffs, like being a drug mule, or providing sexual services to hiv positive people.
im supporting mr desantis stance on the covid 19 situation all the way (even though im singaporean).
very well said… people seem to have “outsourced” personal responsibility of their health over to lockdowns and vaccines and their government, and worse, they want everyone else to do the same
then you are practically invincible to covid or any other flu.
its really that simple.
if you are so busy that you dont even have time to exercise(which i believe is just an excuse), then you have to watch what you eat.
if you dont exercise, simply eat lesser.
maintaining a healthy weight is really the key to longevity.
wanting more lockdowns and vaccines is just ridiculous.
millions of people are gonna be pushed into poverty and suicide.
well then too bad for them.
but those jobs have little impact to our local industries.
"many of the new arrivals from india work in the construction, marine and process sectors and live in the dormitories".

me and my friend invested 2xxk into a company in aug 2019.
we did the shares transfer and director inclusion via corp sec.
abruptly in oct 2019, our share holding and directorship was removed from acra by himself holding on to the corp pass, without our knowledge and approval.
the company stopped operations.
i issued a cheque to hong leong finance, but the payment is rejected.
at thus point, our names had been removed from acra and the md did not informed us.
we tried to approach the md, but he is not contactable.
does any of this sounds like a cheating case.
just call police.
police bochap, say civil case.
the company is not closed down but ceased operations.
the md refused to hand over signatory after we were added in as director.
our agreement is that once the company is doing well, we will sell back the shares to him.
it was all over the news when the 6 church leaders misused more than $50 million of the church’s funds to further the pop music career of pastor kong hee’s wife.
elements of criminal breach of trust.
misappropriates that property;.
converts that property for his own use;.
entrustment is easily found in cases where a professional receives property.
this means that they must have had the intention to cause someone (such as themselves) to wrongfully receive a benefit, or to wrongfully cause a loss to the victim.
who is the corp sect
the corp sec is in yishun and did not have any knowledge of the md transfering back the sharea to himself.
he has to correct it.
after the company ceased operations (not closed down).
the md transferred back the shares to us.
what damages you looking for?
i understand bro.
actually i am trying to gather some advice from probably ex agency officers to see what type of evidence is needed to prove my case stronger.
we will restrict ourselves to within the state court court limit.
otherwise high court will cost more.
no, as in the 'cheating' what loss was there to you?
how much will u tip each of them ?
no tips to them at all

u invested 2xxk and didnt took part in day to day ops of the business and to rectify internal control issues.
yes,  we are seeking to recover part of our investment.
its not we are not involved.
we were kept out of the operations.
basically the md is screwed if m&aa is crafted well.
whatever will be, will be.
we have invested more than quarter mil.
easy for us to say.
money not entirely mine
tq buddy will look at this route
thanks for the advice.
the md came to see me with a 3 yrs p.
i called on a friend to help him.
we gave the company 2xxk for 51% of his comapny share agreeing to return 31% back to him once his ops stabilised.
after transfer the shares and money, he refused to transfer signatory of bank accout.
he just mysteriously stopped operation and trf our share holding and directorship.
and became uncontactable.
does it sound like we have a case against him?
but proving expensive
investment was over quarter mil, seeking to recover 200k

an embassy spokesman said it was "nothing but a political tool used by a few anti-china and separatist elements to deceive and mislead the public".
"anyone with conscience and reason will not be deceived or fooled," the spokesman said.
what the "tribunal" said.
and other very senior officials in the prc and ccp (chinese communist party) bear primary responsibility for acts that have occurred in xinjiang.
the world uyghur congress (wuc), which represents the interests of the mostly muslim uyghurs in xinjiang and around the world, asked nice in 2020 to set up an independent tribunal to investigate accusations of abuse in xinjiang.
in a statement on thursday, its foreign ministry dismissed the wuc as a separatist organisation under the control and funding of anti-china forces in the united states and the west.
"this so-called court has no legal credentials nor any credibility," a ministry spokesperson said, describing the testimony given as false and the final judgment as a "political farce performed by a few clowns".
xinjiang's stability, development and prosperity," the ministry spokesperson said of the uyghur tribunal.
un experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly uyghurs and members of other muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in xinjiang.
the munich-based wuc welcomed the tribunal's judgment.

yup, by right right right, corp sec needs to meet up all parties to sign in his/her presence and he/she will endorse.
but most cases, people just pass that document around for the next person to sign.

call newspaper, pick up headline, let his supplier/clients know.
means they not going to jab kids for this age group?
they are recommending to not vaccinate the healthy teenagers, and only vaccinate those with underlying conditions.
quoting from the article:.
"the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation did advise widening the existing vaccine programme to include an extra 200,000 teenagers with specific underlying conditions.
oyk going to pofma these scientists?
means they are not going to jab their own kids.
don’t worry according to mtf everyone has underlying conditions so all will be eligible for jabs under these uk guidelines
this guy should be taught a lesson.

samster sees hamster becomes monster.
hdb keep cat is illegal.

from hamster to xhamster.
om case, not penetration under 16yo, not so bad.
he was 21 years old then.
the girlfriend still with him
maybe the girlfriend used to buy xhamsters from him before then accidental fell on e bed and the rest is history
he will just remain silent on the matter.
the ri comment, the tone of that sentence totally different from lousy school comment.

why they even choose to rent that space?
it was forever21 before them iirc, all cleared out and partitioned.
the level between ground floor and mrt exit seems like accidentally built.
this is the taichi master ceo's legacy.
supposed to become the main money generating arm of smrt during the rail maintenance negligence years.

it’s very 90s loh!
woo ricebox was good.
the concept was great actually, using leftover space beside the mrt for retail.
but the wayfinding is ****, so hard to go in and out, and the interior is so dull and dated.
sometimes they dont even have aircon in the deeper shops.
cos they're made by gen x.

$12 cow leather from aliexpress.
bespoke crocodile leather wallet.
me bought a picard from a metro sale before.
its stitches went loose bit by bit over time.
rendered it 'useless' to me to even continue to use  it 
it was bought 12 yrs ago   .
after discounts around 30+ iirc.
original price was 50+.
but its not a full wallet.
more like cardholder but it has enough space and size to put cash.
bought a new piece recently cos this model is very hard to find, even other brands dont have.
so buy and standby first just in case.
pic of my 12yrs.
seems like every year same story….

he yrf everything back to himself via his corp pass without our approval.
it sounds like him.
i still think its him.
i think is from wp.
r we able to do anything abt it?
could be someone else then ?
replying on fb comment seems to be a good way to clear his own name
means its all said by vivian?
otherwise means his a even bigger ass 
i find it difficult to believe that vb made those comments himself.
the voice sounds different.
i still think lw made the comments.
anyways, this requires technical experts from edmw to prove it conclusively with some voice software or something.
seems like him    .
told u that house is haunted.
the way “lousy” is pronounced is a dead give-away.
 it’s lw; hear enough of his speeches and you know.
initially it was just elitism.
if not him then who?
 he looked when he heard it.
title say raised voice.
inside post hum chee ask what will happen.
i dont usually give dispute resolution advice on the internet but my 2 cents:.
kan him back shout at him loud loud like ballsy gangster
no wonder theres the ceca n cobra joke all along.
whats more lethal than a venomous snake?
how you know the snake is a he?
hope it is not a csb.
what if c guys learn this and bite us?
the snake met his greatest nemesis.
ceca snake deadlier than venomous snake.
why kill own kind?
so its not a myth.
if you see a cobra and a ceca.
kill the ceca first
the story of killing ceca over cobra is true!
rip to the snake.
if 1 ceca and 100 cobras, in a room.
who will you kill first?
for me, cecs first.
n release 100 cobras to the wild.
i had a very bad experience with c guy.
actually they are not worth comparing to snakes.
snakes are thousand times better than them.
i know they eat snake but this is ….
like to see him do that when a mosquito bites him

if it dose't then post big big!
report to wanbao and mothershit!
i am more disappoint with the various agencies on their response and advice.
will think abt wjat u said.
yes buddy, we have the acra printout of the subsequent change by him and its indicated made by him.
this subsequent change is without any sipporting documents or agreements between share holders.
the puzzling point is that the police do not see that a crime is committed.
and acra is not responding.
what other agencies should i be approaching?
i wanted to talked to commercial affairs but they told me to lodge a police report and was assigned an io.
obviously the io do not find any problem with the investigation.
just did a insolvency search and he is bankrupt.
we may try to pursue the criminal aspect.
it not our decision to retain.
he refuse to add our names in as signatories after we added our names.
really angry to feed scammers .
in after revert back
i find it hard to believe acra didnt inform ts.
usually gt email informing the directors.
isnt this cause to terminate him on the spot?

shan challenges leong to a ceca debate and leong gamely accepts the challenge despite being up against a formidable minister.
will shan accept lim tean’s challenge on a tv ceca debate?
why should 3 wood root accept a "challenge" from a nobody who is ranting in fb?
we all have time.
hope he join forces with leong to help him with the debate.
talk so much for what, he should help leong with preparations.
only mps are allowed to debate in parliament.
dont be surprised.
when phv drivers and food and parcel riders say .
 there’s no rule that restricts them within the confines of a parliamentary assembly.
if shamugan and other pap ministers thinks ceca is a very good deal, they should come out and debate outside parliament
want to debate why must go parliament to debate ?
just open a facebook group or facebook page to open debate.
let all join in
that is a wrong approach.
who is lim tean to even ask for a debate?
he is just a private citizen like anybody else.
just by giving speeches, posting on youtube and facebook doesn’t give him any right to ask for debates.
it is the correct approach if the topic of debate is of national importance.
 and it’s not about lim tean requesting.
lim tean is really my new favourite politician now.
you know the drill.
they are bullies.
would be good to have miw vs dr thum, lim tean and of cos the person who was challenged lmw
but its always been dead what.
is smrt a rail operator or property company?
shops here are doing better and better.

in this thread?
selling only 30 boxes priced at s$6 a day, she said it is nearly impossible for her to cover rental and overheads each month.
smrt has proven themselves to be blood suckers
the obvious happened and virus infections spiked.
then they impose ha phase 2.
30 boxes of what?
transactions during p2ha!
same group of people will be taking over.
that's the reason why no improvement but price increase.
that's why always shoot the .
so the joke about indian n snake make sense after all
they swim in granges river and exalt cow biowaste.
venom has nearly no effect.
i had my fair share of experiences.
i was under very immerse stress mentally.
even until now.
it’s a snake eat snake world over there
makes perfect sense what.
means ceca is more dangerous than snakes.
bitten by a krait is no joking matter lei.
hope he survive.

"every school is good school".
who's from monk's hill then?
seems lw still want the pm post.
unless cos he turned his head away and affected the frequency or something
i suspect vb will be the fall guy for lw so as not to tarnish lw for pm.
i wont be surprised as vb is a cxxk sxxker to those above him.
i hear 3 different voices.
just listen to that "must have been a lousy school" sentence.
whose voice is that ?
wow double down on his lies.

where is @sticky
i think is photoshopped the face
but good effort
he was seeking funding for his operations.
he did not let us know the full extend of his personal liabilities.
his personal liability is actually more than 1/2 mil outside.
when we invested he showed that he used the funds to buy raw material etc etc.
little do we know suddenly all just stop ops.
thank you all anyway
ts say the md is a bankrupt?
he should be disqualified to be director.
was he the only director before you joined?
ts hold 51% shares in the company now?
ssmc issued an open po to the company.
ssmc then will used the materoal and we will bill on a monthly basis based on stock drawn down.
the md over projected his sales figure.
reaching on 20 to 30k per month instead of at least 100k.
he was not contactable since feb 2020
but if counterparty no money, your 50k will be poorly spent.
usually this kind, people will still sue.
have seen people spend more than what theyre owed just to spite the other party.
tq buddy, our investment is over 1/4 mil.
aimming to sue for 1/4 mil at state court.
minus 50k legal.
once reported and proven guilty, you then proceed civil suit.
posted with aos is my fav hardwarezone forums app
if he has a po of $3mil from a reputable company like that, the bank sme loan section would be more than willing to loan him that measly $250k.
sounds premeditated to con
didnt read the 8 pages.
corp sec should be independent.
corp sec needs to draft and sight the signed director's resolution that says you agree or resign from your position as director of the company.
check if the company has been strike out or did the md hire auditor to wind down company.
likely it is strike out as its cheaper.
unlikely will be issue to small vendor.
just read this.
your chances are nil.
now its whether you want to spend more money and put him in jail for fraud.
wait till senior position in banking, it or any others sectors dominated by ceca national.
just wait for wp to raise the issue.
why stop there?
should open debate to edmwers too.
vietbu dont cost anything above 100.
now demand over supply.
sometimes 6 a month.
what does 1/1 mean?
you need to pay tax but viet bu don’t need .
the sooner you end your misery the better
you need to wake up from your cool story
i know my life.
you are just some miserable troll.
these vietbu 330/1/1 earning more monthly than most of us  here
so time to report these stables

dr yogendra told his family his condition was too critical.
a video of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed mr sharma and former congress corporator yogendra chouhan purportedly shouting at dr yogendra shrivastava.
cm chouhan tweeted, "saddened by the incident, a senior doctor has resigned.
creating furore was neither in public good nor right in the fight against covid.
snake eat snake world out there.

it isn’t the doctor fault.
it is the government failure for not being prepared for the pandemic.
just pull the mask off the guy shouting at him with expletives.
cause no point since india medical facilities are breaking down.
probably resign to save himself.
imagine doctors working 18 hours a day now
so, he will be safe and protected here .
on a separate note,  .
anyway, the doctor quite poor thing too.
he should cum here!

lol, pap keep building shiny malls like what era alr, and pump up reits but cnt capitalise on e-commerce
copy good idea, but **** execution  
building a mall before a row of sbopping malls is a great idea
these shops are nothing new and not a novelty, every train stations in other countries has them.
he just dont bother and leave them to their own devices .
very sad, its pathetic
ironically its warrants a fine if u eat and drink in the mrt .

da nasal voice jiin dangz leii…………….
i could winner this post a million times.
no point they sacrifice 2 right?
well well well.
then who could have it been.
need edmwer with voice analysis software to sexpose lw and disgrace him for good.
tsl just said he's from monk's hill.
nothing bad about that.
the "lousy" word is an 1000000% dead giveaway.
i lost all respect for this liar.
cause as long it doesn’t match your conclusion, it’s fake news
i though they should be whiter than white?
most likely vb was told not to say its whom, same goes for tsl.
so vb is taking the fall for him
lol, why you so worked up.
i didnt say yours fake news.
and its not i made up my mind.
im just pointing out possible alternative.
if conzfirmz is liang popo, will lose job?
the other thing we need to consider is personality, who is more likely to utter those words.
lw is more careful and conservative type.
vb is the "commentator" type, he likes to comment.
this is his personality.
meanwhile lw did not ever make such comments.
so i think the sentence "must have been a lousy school" is more consistent with vb personality and vb previous sentence.
its more likely to come out from vb.
quarantine for what ?
camping here, will up your points!
this type usually braless at home  and wont hesitate to press her boobs against her brothers or dad.

people say outside food all unhealthy try to cook at home.
is fish soup healthy?
i find kfc healthier
buy raw fish, buy boiling water from drinks stall.
cook the raw fish with the boiling water.
taste the natural freshness of the fish cooked to middle well done.
just fish plus water.
i tried to cook fish soup at home.
with tofu n spinach.
u find the soup tasty and your mum cooking not tasty?
gxgx tasty food usually is unhealthy and your mum cooking is healthy that's why it tastes healthy
its usually the soup stock that may be unhealthy.
 minimum salt and no msg.
you want healthy, you want to hiam no taste.
i ever talk to a friend doc.
most of fish soup is full of msg.
sodium and salt.
it is infact very unhealthy.
tell me to eat ok.
but avoid drinking too much soup
one outside hawker.
i usually skip ramen soup.
u should benchmark the taste of your mum's cooking for healthiness if u r unsure.
once they detect the high level of msg and sodium .

think as an nsf i stare at maps even longer for topo .
it’s not that’s interesting.
why look so long?
i hardly use google maps
4 letters, e p i c
since you lumped in tanboonwa in the 2.
this 1 is for you.
the ending meetup for what.
during my time when i first log into edmw without a nick, it was epic.
i think back in 2005 towards 2010 has alot of saga n very entertaining in here.
but matchy is still here.
how dare you insult edmw legendary goddess?
the tbw sagat was legendary.
no fighting required, just pure epicness.
go to 3:10 of the video
this is for what sickness?
so she brought retail into smrt.
lg desmond kwek didnt change too much from previous.
lg neo is more engineering focus.
even before covid
but after rental was raised, swensons pulled out
these days retail is mostly about f&b or services.
yea don don donki.
or they should have jus put their ion hawkers' street there.
you see the don donki at novena mrt.
first time hear where is this ?
i think all shops in exchanges doing badly.
u guys move further down to suntec and marina sq will see even moar ghost towns.
there are a few.
dobby ghaut xchange.
very good for her
some people further their studies for leisure.
most do it for survival.
wa, means she must be some hot diva in her 20s-30s.
i am not sure whether she actually earning if her main income is from the tv station.
i dunno about what side income she is doing like what her colleague ben is doing.
if there is any, then it is good for her.
her children are still young.
it is uncertain that chen xi will make it in the station with so much competition.
i understand that her gal is still studying.
who want fuck her?
she is not those hot looking type.
no need go out of the house.
what a waste of money.
not sure what value addedness are there
what is her husband doing
nus dont have any1 who likes this milf type?
the voice was so distinctly .
its someone who's angling himself to be the next pm.
its about integrity and that's a very serious matter.
there are obviously 3 different voices.
1st vb, 2nd lw, 3rd tsl
the most smiley, friendliest people out there are typically the most conniving.
 they just hide it very well to make you let your guard down.
 in the highest echelons of politics, even more so.
lets assume lw lied.
if its lky era.
lw just dugged a grave for himself by putting it on the record.
denying saying what he had said.
anyway, i think pm lee knows the truth on who said that "lousy school" comment.
miw will be the first to backstab him and downvote him no need all the who who sjw owl come jjww riao
if not him, then tell us who loh.
he definitely heard it anyway since he was sitting in the middle of the conversation
the lousy school part is a totally different pitch and intonation
but lousy school comment sounded like different pitch and tone and intonation .
i assure u that i will vote for u nxt election
its not up to anyone's interpretation.
so tt vivian made a statement and he answered it himself?
they should admit who said that
keen to know too
speaking of which, mine too…….
buy wholesale electricity.
once you go wholesale, you wont regret.
but sp wholesale no fixed rate right
time for them to recoup.
i just signed up sembcorp for two years.
rate per kwh is 0.
inbefore sp wholesale
state your average usage per month.
else just use sp wholesale if your usage is high > 500/600 kwh/month
nth is unhealthy.
as long as everything eat moderately i think should be fine
simple guide: anything that tastes good is unhealthy.
yong tau hoo rice with soup should be healthy as well.
u need to marinate the fish with soy sauce and sesame oil let it absorb then boyl
have you tried before in public?
dirty af, i know, but seemed like he was taking stock of his bread.
a person of culture, i see!
i am partial to tremere.
definitely this guy.
sadako trumps both!
the other half of the stories, are born with a werewolf gene.
and then there are stories where there are both werewolves that were created and purebloods that were born.
i’d say it’s a draw against living forever.
u all dunno.
snakes, king cobra are the strongest.
so who stronger?
they like dead people during the day.
easily killed then.
if course vampire
one of the worst actually
thick peanut sauce will be in amk central hawker centre .
it’s like super thick
the famous nasi lemak stall at changi point.
everyday long q.
but to me it was average.
in fact neighbouring mizzy stall taste better.
sadly its gone, now his franchaise called ramly mee rebus is all over but taste not quite the same.
still good though.
and they are not proud.
they have been preparing since sars.
they are still preparing since sars
they yolo and couldn't bother less.
you die your problem
preparing vs prepared
recover at home
they are brain washed and felt entitled.
we are not them
oyk say he's prepared for 10k daily cases.
now near 5k only.
no need to panic
imagine if they din.
they are well prepare.
when **** hits, then will scramble.
good quality ft who actually create jobs are leaving.
most are fairweather people.
this is why we need to implement a defence tax equal to what local pay for cpf
1 ftrashes out.
3 ftrashes in.
1 ctrashes out.
300 ctrashes in.
1 local their letters.
they should pay for public services like police, scdf, defense.
when choosing a city, expats are not bothered by mask wearing + group number limits.
this is the truth.
they want safety for themselves and their family.
they want extremely high pay.
they want generous housing allowance from employer.
they want maids and servants.
they want generous car allowance or free company car.
they want a city where everything works.
must ban face mask for foreigners !
one group of expats go.
another will come.
these expats (might as well call them tourists) will seldom be happy to settle here
do not come back here to work ever again
it went to new fts coming into singapore, two for the first time.
and i personally know of two expat families i know personally that just flew in over the new year via the quarantine free vtls from the us and hongkong.
but came back in december 2021 cos he couldn't find a job back in his home country for 1.
else, you think the 400 or so imported daily covid cases are all incoming tourists eager to snap pictures at the merlion or sentosa?
i was in that thread.
fastest thread in edmw history.
quarrel until fast and furious.
very interesting thread!
camping for more
hope they are no longer around -1sss.
n0ng n0ng time ag0 before edmw was n0thing but bbfas.
chomp chomp really small hawker centre
cnt even protect own parents.
why want to fight but keep on shouting to call police?
what started this?
who the guy wearing the white cap lul.
is it cos they order nasi babi at rk house again
police post closed?
quick call police call police.
you scold my father/mother .
someone tried to order nasi babi again?
make sure he learns not to hit a woman again.
but yes it is.
maybe even way before saw's era.
smrt used to own all these spaces since its paid in full with coffers.
i suppose that’s the familiar scene all over town.
still smrt has not maximized its real.
estate potential with it commanding all prime real estate space.
dhoby exchange and then marina bay has fantastic empty unit for ages.
any other country where the government use public transport’s marketting business and real estate business to subsidize cost?
want to copy the concept from the japanese but fail miserably….
the underground metro mall thing is not a .
its all over the world even in.
just that this dunno what xchange thing was.
ya is like sandwich upstairs.
who da fug would wanna go there seriously?
relocate the mrt gate entry to b1, and shops to b2.
this will make more economical sense.
everybody misses the retail and f&b there unless you are taking mrt and transferring a bus back home.
just directly above orchard station all under shelter.
young time very airport.
suspected she go enhancement.
one of the riches mediacorp actress/actor.
most pple haf to study to survive
i once did some work for her and edmund chen in their home.

else feel more tired.
im still in my nap.
im replying from my long dreams.
little wonder he was a divorcee.
liar liar all the way.
no integrity is worst or lousy school is worst?
as they surely will 
every 4 yrs, this guy will always change parentage .
the voice is so distinctively lw's  i will need to go for ear examination soon.
if only a few heard the lousy sch comment as lw voice, then there's high chance these few heard it wrongly.
he is really taking a huge risk.
nope, public hair on fire better.
no need boyzillian!
what do you suggest?
ever heard of onscreen personality?
media will say the audio/video online are doctored?
when in doubt, vote all of them out
nice very nice.
too skinny for my liking
do you remember you started a thread with literally the same thing?
first year you pay less, second year you pay the average rent and 3 year you pay more.
to help tenants cushion some of the impact with their cash flow.
only new units?
for renewal contracts, need to bargain with them and tell them due to covid business been hit.
traditionally, vampires are some of the strongest creatures in games.
werewolves strong but not same level.
must see is which type from which movie or drama.
pap vampires are the most dangerous.
werewolves fast attack speed.
greater werewolves - super high regeneration.
vampires not so strong damage.
vampires level drain you - a kind of weakening.
all your attributes drop.
i think is pontianak 
vampire control werewolf.
active at night.
vampires stronger, werewolfs only brute force, use saliva to fight.
 that’s why the vampires rule the werewolves.
 human have sex.
 doesn't mean dinosaurs weaker than humans.
movies always put it as vampires smarter, werewolves physically stronger.
duno shift to where nao
this stall famous for mee soto, u go eat mee rebus?
this isn’t central right ?
at chong boon food centre?
where’s the marine parade mee rebus anyone knows?
those born in 80s would know
haig road , good ‘n’ jolly
it is our neighbors.
when young selling them in school tuckshop.
now old grandma .
but still made for us only
one of the cheapest ard, yes .
afandi hawa & family mee rebus, haig rd: mee rebus made with shrimp, flower crab & mutton
ts have a simple life.
satisfied by below average food
definitely not true that inspirasi is the best mee rebus.
i have eaten more than once there.
haig road food centre has a stall that sells old school style mee rebus
really thank to pap good foresight
then save fore retirement
no country is perfect.
which country buy house.
lhl is a great leader!
i just realised he looked like hp baxxter from scooter lmao
but it we need to always compare all these negative demonstrations to show that we are good, we are ignoring the problems and will soon lose the plot
no need loan buy house?
fairer to use multiples of annual income to judge affordability
grads come work earn 10k per month, no traineeships at all.
multiple of annual income .
he was not wrong.
choose between matured estates, town and new estates.
house so expensive.
he in ivory tower too long.
totally disconnect from the ground.
float like butterfly sting like bee style was the best?
depends on the what you want believe.
not steven lim?
well known for his dazzling footwork and his unorthodox defense style.
dunno about goat but i think tyson is the most dominant boxer ever.
and all his knock outs are extremely impressive.
tyson is a beast lol, ali i think is more of a tactician.
note i only post those who posted their images public on social media before aka facebook / friendster / blogspot era.
u know that owe money dont pay biao kia?
geraldine wo ai ni

dancing with kiwis
she is much better than me.
i've only obtained multiple fractures.
it’s been about 2 years of covid pandemic.
i would like to give her multiple orgasms
actually at her age is just for fun or goal fulfilment only.
likely she is studying for interest, self fulfillment etc, not for a new job 
no uptron no talk.
she may be calling it quit if the tv station decided to give her a lousy contract and showing her some major disrespect.
2 yrs obtain multiple diplomas?
is there a catch in the article?
what browse are you using?
chrome on mobile 
but do keep it coming
meow meow so cute 
paging koizumi to come back

feeling very sorry for not providing a second set of covid measures for him and his family and his whole bunch of friends, its our fault, we apologise
jews are very cliquish in big companies.
to me, i consider them to be the white version of indian nationals.
they have this under-siege mentality and always keep the lucrative jobs among themselves.
good luck securing a bed if dio covid.
please dont come back.
goodbye and goot riddance cecapoos!
popping champagne now
of course not happy
dont talk so much and go!
make sure dont come back.
they really think they are talent?
people have option to go countryside live a less stressful life.
ntuc "fairprice" really is "fair" price.
like buy 2 free 1.
fairprice has 10eggs for $1.
ntuc is pricing itself out of the market.
wow i think cs would be unsatisfactory.
not every items.
some are more ex
500gm for 10 eggs, that's abt the decent size.
45: newborn eggs from ss.
a wee bit smaller, maybe lesser than 500gms in a pack.
not that bad imo
now no more liap
pasar eggs are not the cheapest now.
fp inhouse brand smart choice is 1.
its not fixed.
that's why if u see it as reasonably priced, must fhfl .
maybe he found something?
even if he finds it.
that is a crazy amount of money.
not stored in cloud?
0 still ok at times.
seems more "listenable" 
im the same way.
all sounds like sheet
i only listen to gold905 
i really, really miss lush 99.
not the lush 99.
5 when they decided to end it .
that god-awful indie crap and rosalyn lee stinking up the airwaves.
i miss the original ”sexy.
that was basically the only station i tuned in to until they decided to turn it into an indie + local acts themed station 
0 is the worst.
quite naise what.
you need to move on with the times 
obviously you haven't watched "van helsing" .
i thought vampires are faster than werewolves?
maybe you saw them is faster movement, switch to flight mode all that.
combat wise they're more caster, spell type, drain 'essence' eg.
werewolves are stronger on full moon.
vampire bite werewolf becum what.
werewolf scratch vampire becum what
mix of both better.
tiagong werewolves are vampire's pets, maciam dogs are human pets.
rich > vampire = **g off.
rich > werewolf = **g off
i thot edmwers prefer zombies apocalypse
train to busan?
when did he say this?
why must degrade other countries to make yourself feel good?
credit must be given due .
needs to produce the pap elite who said it.
otherwise saying i didnt do it is insufficient for matter to end just like that
no need to doubt that all of them are from the same party and are doing good cop bad cop routine.
means pap is a party that condones liars.
what a lousy party!
but i won’t be surprised when vivian is goh chok tong’s age, he will write book to reveal the truth about the ri is a lousy school comment 
if it was workers party who said it, be prepared everyday media start shaming them for being irresponsible, no dignity.
i assure you, his reply is as transparent as pap.
who wants to buy such crap.
irony is someone who come out and urge them to admit it and apologize cos integrity is so important .
that person is tt vivian
till now, none of them dare to admit?
luckily, these comments not passed by opposition,  else we will see this becomes our daily headlines.
if not him, then who?
dont tell me vivian was talking to himself?
use the "lousy" comments to compare to his own speech.
not interested in dating anyone now
that time she came edmw kpkb for a few months lol.
n4sha iirc -1sss
but now is rook rike what riao?
yucks she love youyongku that hypocrite
innocents n cutes

amk ave 10, blk 409 food market has the best i ever tried.
food king recommendation?
its normal but its cheap.
super expensive some more.
the chicken is dry and tasteless.
feel like eating mee rebus tomorrow
mee rebus is just mee rebus.
just some noodles with sauce.
i think not much different between different stalls.
tanglin halt best.
freshly ground spices.
the "secret" of mee rebus lies in its sauce or gravy , that what make or break the jhj-ness of it .
old school is using sweet potatoes based gravy.
they famous for satay sauce on mee rebus but after tasting  find it very normal.
noticed people order mee soto > mee rebus.
abang only open stall after 8pm and always long q but worth the wait
helping friend ask
i apologize first.
this a very ghey qns.
listen to money fm 89.
mainly listening to 90.

best news article for the day
one less of these virus spreaders.

they were disappointed these years due to covid restrictions.
but dont feel sorry for them, they are on inter coy transfer and free to go back after 3 years.
robert sun walk home .
other nationalities will struggle.
its very different mindset.
these expats come here to command and conquer meaning making decisions.
not listening to decisions from our elites.
serve and fxxx off.
byebye, dont come back then
ss eggs or other stuff , sometimes it is really cheaper than ntuc.
but ss fresh prawns, sometime is more expensive than giant.
you mean their egg price will change according to demand and supply?
the supply mainly 
500g onli per pack.
all the small small eggs
ntuc is the fairest price set by government and unions.
too cheap is unfair price.
that is call fair price not cheapo price .
maybe this week cost $x.
next week cld be either up or down by xx cents
which low ses outlet store it?
amk hub, tpy mrt, j8 all hab.
usually frozen stuff.
but some of their drinks are slightly more expensive though.
ntuc stupid ng chee meng
how freaking ironic
cheap where to find $ for them.
will solve alot of sucession issues right.
no need to mind games so much like that
but shopping malls will be super crowded
brace for ginnas
super crowded everywhere
yes i am very happy  
should impose covid school holiday curfew.
must be back home after 9pm
if two vampires against 20 werewolves, werewolves will win.
by the way vampires and werewolves rumoured to be from the dark hold book.
depends on your definition of stronger.
have you seen werewolves own castles?
not fight money.
vampire stronger unless full moon
so in most story vampire is much more op than werewolves or even the master of werewolves.
i know werewolves weakness to silver but come on .
werewolves better cos vampires suck.
think is depend which fantasy setting.
who cares 3rd world country problem  
their dom living condition and country hygenie is not so good.
pap ibs taking a breather lolol
muhyiddin best pm!

all rook rike ghost
nice chick there.
would be great sugging a cawk.
every year same thread come up
error 404 nothing to see.
why people still confused?
ccp is not china, ccp is not chinese people.
fuck fascists ccp.
common sense is not common to brainwashed people.
but the people enables them.
silence is violence.
why must you open a thread just to say this.
ate since 10 years ago.
now everyday queue is still long.
* cricket silence *
not all mee rebus are made the same, if u know u know.
that gooey albeit edible 
your reply above is way off from my question asked 
this thread really making me hungry!
no just tao cheo, peanut.
yes, though rare.
residents in this estate all know him and say his mee rebus is kyky
i love the mee rebus at old tanjong pagar railway station.
feel like me am dead set on a bowl right now!
why are all the good food  stalls located way out of my zone?
amk 409 is best mee rebus.
the stall at our tampines hub just up their price to from $3.
 with 10% kpt card discount it is $3.
60 which i still find it to be expensive for noodle, gravy and egg.
not worth traveling more than 2km for mee rebus.
the real deal used to be the stall at basement food court of parkway parade.
big portion & yummy.
just different people here will type in their own way
so i do believe him if he says its not him.
but if its proven its really him, then my belief above will no longer hold.
dex wong failed to ask the obvious follow up question.
then sld ask him what does he thinks of such person that gives such comment?
let's all go the bdsm way      
and papship kopes.
monk's hill is tsl.
no doubt, character is permanent.
but there is still other voices.
so now vb is holding something of lw.
ccs should nose house to pray this game
that dex wong did not ask lw who did make the comment?
wong asking wong 
whoever made the comment does not matter unless it came from the mouth of the person heading ministry of education.
even on parliament, mics suddenly turn 'hot', minister's mind wonder 'back to the future' in sec schools, even  talk to themselves.
anyone here or it is normal if someone had 'habit of self-talk' ?
(because i don't).
does miw need to see by imh?
dont let the door hit you on the way out .
sent by a cotton-making sheep
have a safe flight out.
naise way to put it.
could be retrenched.
all these so called expat talents are a drain of good money.
good my nsf son no need defence them.
don’t go back ever again to work
correct rental alone is 18/2k.
see my other thread comment on same topic.
in new york crime rate is very high.
so this article is not telling the truth.
they are moving for other unspoken reasons.
not even counting tax rates in us and ny and nyc.
need to go private schs
you wont be missed.
thank you for leaving.
its always been like this.
now, for that "other group" of foreigners, better if they move to united states to make their home and pursue their pot of gold.
bye, and dont come back.
i think she look more like jiang zuping known as xie mingming

edmw is like this.

the wlh news have shifted the attention from referendum vote in tw today …
kmt have no future in taiwan anymore after what ccp done in hongkong.
your view may be true but kmt still have more capable people than the ddp
where are the more capable people leading the referendum?
the turnout rate was  low isnt it
i thought the pig issue will pass cos its health issue but they seems like dont care

50 bey sai hiam and quality wise above average though not at excellent level, in my opinion.
1st stall facing main road.
opp the stall is a satay stall.
for me its toastbox mee rebus  
who having mee rebus today for lunch?
holy sh1t u found it.
meerebus satay sos.
i think it will be more interesting to go for cruise on wooden ships than modern metal ships
authentic as back then.
the whole wp will be found complicit and wp will be voted out of parliament by overwhelming vote from whites through passing motion.

meanwhile the ivan the terrible case no sound no sight?
is a gift that keeps on giving.
 to the pap that is.
that will likely rule out lmw, lt  you name it and be like the pe going forward.
this is my guess.
what is the point of all that drama if you do not milk maximum political currency from it?
pinky panties so wet in 2022.
please continue to fix wp and waste taxpayer monies
inbefore mass sympathy for miw      
half the article is talking about other stuff!
dont go there then 
politics above everything.
opposition stirs referendum what.
don’t eat the intestines and liver should be ok.
what talking u people?
i think should hold a referendum on the gold stash by general chiang kai sek.
any things else are just distractors.
this guy must be edmw's no.

online voice recorder.
vocaroo is a quick and easy way to share voice messages over the interwebs.
could be dr cheeeeee on the speaker phone.
they were on a live call
is he really from ri and lousy sch same pax?
good to know its not him.
afterall, he was the previous minister for education.
lw: "character means having integrity, having honesty.
looks like the conversation is between vivi & tsl.
this shows the credibility and integrity of pap style and their ibs.
you die your own problem(talking about v coming to own up) everything will be pushed to the person who died.
saying its only 1 person.
its so simple.
that guy has been doing videos on social media, interviews and so on.
just have the balls to read out "must have been from a lousy school" and let everyone hear and judge if its really not him.
just listen to lw's speech.
its his way of speaking.
again like what i've said earlier, go listen to the audio again for 10x.
until this incident.
will vb admit he made the lousy remark.
why keep quiet when the ground point finger at you?
the cs, institution all the same.
just different group leading.
new broom sweeps clean.
all cleared up, lw for pm .
some people really is no see coffin wont shed tears 1 .

@tuv2008 your good friend.

third, cost of living will be reduced.

ts must be ceca.
cos those are multi racial pax?
i tried to pin the voice on vb.
but its very hard to imagine vb saying 'lousy' with equal emphasis on the 'zee' sound.
why someone always like to run to centre stage during covid.
who is throwing oyk under the bus right now.
dont think its him.
so obvious its lw who said it.
then why as a minister, he did not correct the person who made this comment?
he agree not all schools are good, some are lilousy?
it’s obviously the voice is lw but if he dare to say it publicly it’s not him then we just have to suck it up
hmmm, not lw then who.
parliament must be haunted
who's school is lousier?
see he turned his head towards his right at the same time saying those remarks when tsl just seated down.
maybe he overheard the private comments and just turned his head.
 the comment so rude and loud.
i listened to the audio.
 sounded like from the same person.
 but i not csi or audio expert.
 he’s wearing the normal cheap surgical mask.
bento package look nice.
bento, all the different dishes are separated in compartments, taste not mixed.
some ask mother to cook and leech off the food.
price big difference
just like fu cking an atb is vastly different from fu cking a nipponbu.
sounds like food court jap bentos.
integrated dishes for a wholesome experience in dining.
bento - compartmentalized dining to taste different dishes at their own peak.
end joy the same.
as it goes, anything foreign is more expensive.

after a month, he tendered his resignation and refused to share the reason for his departure other than he has found a better offer.
i suspect he is strawberry, unable to handle the work environment and his colleagues.
most likely he left this job for an air-conditioned office job.
my boss just texted me to seek for overseas engineers to fill this position.
civil, mech , electrical, chemical or marine?
mechanical, refrigeration system.
the supervisor is the to?
he is on a 5 days week.
he opt to do food delivery?
no wonder your junior engineer left.
what is wrong with going for a better job?
what job is it anywhere?
i fine the to is ok.
he may be rough, stern, spews vulgarities but otherwise willing to teach.
he knows that this chap will be his direct supervisor in a few months time, doubt he dares to give him problems.
there's always two sides to a story.
think about it, if the job pays decently well, good environment and good co-workers, why would anyone leave?
i think u r better off in employing experienced diploma holder for 3.
just a thought.
is it the supervisor didnt treat him well?
now they good business?
oh you bet it is!
good business huh?
maybe u see wrongly.
those guys are her pimp
lots of people need to use debt recovery services.
you win court case and court awards you the money.
they are notwhatyouthink
they go over and talk only.
the creditor now waste even more money as need to pay fees for debt collector also
look like bouncers kor kor
i saw a rooster
it does seem most of the time, they are on, no collection no pay.
most of the time the creditor is no more moves left, then go look for debt collector.
basically the priority is skewed towards the big boys.
and you wonder why they are unwilling to wait for liquidators to come in.
some people would give in to pressure cos they have no where else to move to.
if you rich af you prefer jiu hu bu or jpmm?
atb more supply and higher mileage whereas nippon-bu more kc.
is about the journey, not just the destination.
cheap and good, and the quality is quite high too, for the cheap price.
you must pick before hand which to experience and they do 1 by 1.
the pricing tend goes into the presentation, ingredients, and brand perhaps.
food court bento is scam.
especially those sell both ‘japanese’ and ‘korean’.

mic was on and recorded, considered as part of parleement speech.
tsl only quipped his monk's hill portion.
you say lei,no need to think so hard.
he took a deep breath before turning his head.
come ge 2025 the video/audio clip will come back to haunt him.
he is free to say what he likes and deny everything 
the most dispensible.
clown chun sing sit so far away from rest of the leeders means what?
not me, not you, not him.
then must be ghost.
he so stress huh?
but in parliament?
those who wronged him should apologise
monk's hill confiirm is tsl.
but 1st and 2nd sounds like vb to me.
rhetorically, 1st and 2nd possible to be said consecutively .
this is the minimum expectation of any representation of the electorate.
assurance is a feeling, not a fact.

if it’s me, i would just whack those mofos up.
ask his edmw name
this is s real case i recently encountered in some training settings.
my company just hired new ft for 4500, what you offering
some people are more suited in handling work alone by himself.
firstly to have a fresh grad with little experience to lead a team few months after on the job training is asking too much.
not just purely base on roles and titles.
youngsters these days prefer jobs that are office bound with aircon.
just assume they had a better offer and wish them the best.
when he was here we were paying for his on the job training.
due to lesser/zero new engineers from myanmar/phillipines/india recently.
then he pass me his name card, senior technical engineer!
after jumping ship, now he become better off.
u offer better pay if u want engineers to sweat under hot sun
5k is too low these days le.
and in case ts didn’t know.
most fresh grad / uni grads are loaded with money , either from parents or from investing in stocks and crypto.
so what is that $3.
you say overpay.
maybe to the employee is not enough?
everyday 9-6 is just online/ at office to show face.
ds is broadwell small 3?
first and only edmw girl with leaked videos 
i 2008 member, dunno any of these
should show more photos of wd.
this is quite sad.
its not 2020 version, they are all old edmwers.
there are no new mm for 2020.
face it,  good majority of hardwarezone and facebook users are 30s-40s
all bbfas here need a chance 
upz your points.
but no swimming pool.
but at least the condominium is more instagramable
 our jobs here is so unattractive to them ?
all refer drv grab here.
i sympathesize with the expats.
the only thing to do about the exit of fts is to tap the local workforce.

expats are foreigners with no roots and loyalty to this country?
who would expect otherwise from them?
good good, 1 way ticket right?
sorry bit what?

there is only like 1 woman so far, that made me want to look at her instagram.
what is the ideal age to have gf?
no luck means no luck.
ts, love and marriage is not a race.
this is something young people like you need to learn.
when you have a child and have to live with someone you once loved and now hate, that's when the nightmare begins.
love and marriage is to be enjoyed.
not re-marry 3 times.
go find a sales job.
no need to regret.
if u are someone of a gd character, am sure your so-called friends could put a gd word about urself to the gals that they knew of.
even to intro their gfs'/wives' female friends if need be.
but i still pressed on brother.
and look forward to my life and hope that something good happens.
my friends are mostly guys lo…don’t really have much female friends 
tnats what i told myself at 20 as well.
i think they need to hire real full-time delivery guys for food delivery, with incentive for performance.
if performance dont meet kpi, then fire.

lg 49-in ultrawide 5k monitor.

but we are not into body-shaming.
a couple of prefects are bigger than him, but the assistant, a monitress, is rather petite.
find 27inch too big
no more trump ma
find some excuse to kill each other.
whats the new world order?
who's the king
the new world order will be countries losing sovereignty.
basically there will be no nationalism.
people will have free movement.
probably a unified currency too.
basically the eu but  globally.
the smaller trial run failed but the geniuses believe if they extended it globally, this idea will succeed.
but who is the overall leader then?
i think globalization has gone amok and affected societies.
 the ordinary joe have realized globalization only benefits big corporations, corrupt governments and the wealthy elite.
 societies have paid the price in terms of economic outsourcing, wage depression and uncontrolled immigration waves.
 this world really needs a drastic reset to put things back in order.
 even if this results in anarchy, violence and destruction, it is worth the price to pay to address the corporate greed that has damaged livelihoods, distorted trade and polluted environments.
the conspiracy has been discussed since the old george bush's times.
but here, the new world order reality is ceca.
kali projected onto building and shiva at cern might not be simple.
someone from rome 
rome is a tool.
infiltrated and positioned to push for it.
but if its the usa, the usa would be nothing like it is today.
and its not someone the people elected.
is hulk hogan 
is too big to be united.
if u do it by force, u hurt yourself more.
human mindset changes  very fast, especially if it doesn't benefit them.
let's simply ponder upon this point.
we need the disparity between the rich and the poor to make the world function.
cos dont have youtube account.
anyone, please feel free to upload to youtube if you have account.

i know an edmwer that has that hobby
i only hear 2 voices in that video clip.
pinky sit so near to them.
he probably hears them every time.
only this time the mic was on.
im not an elite but its too big to coverup moreover miw is not a small company.
tan see leng is from monk's hill.
vivian b has admitted he said.
go and  check the video of the telecast debate.
 maybe i didn’t on loud enough or what.
 then only when tan replied with ‘i’m from monk’s hill”, did he turn.
likely cos tan just spoke and he felt what tan had to say could probably be something to note i.
it seems obvious to me.
of course, no discreet minister would have uttered those disrespectful words had he known the mic was recording.
the emperor has no clothes.
meaning:​this expression is used to describe a situation in which people are afraid to criticize something or someone cos the perceived wisdom of the masses is that the thing or person is good or important.
you should reply him on his fb page: "i knew you wouldnt have said such disrespectful words.
the person who uttered those words and not owning up must have been a hypocrite without integrity!
yes, agree this is not a trivial issue since it involves the integrity of our ministers.
anyone remember snali_f or something?

mas and banks could have strengthened the security protocols.

go for the strongest bank.
one question do the banks hold physical cash?

scammer trf the money without otp notification triggered is their fault?
i dont mind being a hotel if that's the business model.

they run away for the most minor of issues.
so whats the big deal with them leaving?
good riddance to the leechers and spandex warriors.
yes that's right.
they have tons of multi millionaires & billionaires .
so an entire economy is created to serve the rich .
and stuck in endless infection of covid all variants, unfortunately; there is a good reason for mask wearing and social distancing .

they more driven and positive altittude.
dont waste your time.
my boss asked if we should cast our nets to overseas engineers.
good luck with your offer.
what are the future job prospects in your company?
or will be stagnated after sometime?
propsperous free market economy.
obviously the junior didnt feel the equilibirum , no matter what you think/say about him is irrelevant.
by then, even $2k everybody will be fighting for the job to serve you.
end of the day its just to keep depressing wages of enginners and yet expect alot of responsibilities from grads.
have you see fresh grad lead a team on first day?
maybe here's the problem.
indeed, there are numerous benefits in this practice.
a luxury you may not have if the outfit is small.

mnc or  sme company ?
ts working in bedok?
underpaying people again.
no wonder jump ship.

edmwers said no to vaccine.
means you jab early you lugi

sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.
though really dunno who is it.
wearing white bikini.
but that was very long ago.
mr wong said the recent increase in the number of cases is not unexpected, since more people have been going out following the loosening of restrictions earlier,.
all he cares about is his vaccine kpi!
ask him to poke his own backsai everyday luh.
economic growth at all costs .
new citizens votes at all costs .
holy prince to become king at all costs
it is tied to his performance bonus.
should be order from the top.
the death and infection are inevitable what ?
what more do you want him to do ?
do a booster dance like what jc did ?
high vaxx rate but their cases spiking like no tomorrow !
oyk is right, his focus is now on vaccinations rate and not number of cases.
only kumgong edmwer still so concern with daily case count  .
this aljunied loser's performance bonus is pegged to vaccination rate is it?
bro, why he no dare admit huh?
leaders without integrity is a big no no.
vivian & monks hill.
you guys stop imagining things just cos rk was caught by spf for lying.

from what i observed, people who marry young divorce faster.
they are mentally unprepared for the challenges of marriage.
then there is enough maturity to handle quarrels.
i was married at 30.
now married 20 years.
enjoy your single life.
once married, there is no turning back.
yes, there are some learning to it.
what seems to be the problem?
too shy to ask a girl out?
i want your height  
huai lucky enuff?
count yourself lucky.
tour the world without worries.
and totally not on the same wavelength as you.
the bank security suck to have this kind of thing to happen.
no afford at all when it comes to pr.
i personally ignore all sms and emails from banks.
if it’s that impt, call me biatch!
thats what 2fa should do.
both has fault.
this looks legit?
everyone needs to make the effort
this could happen to any company, not only the banks.
it is a very unfortunate lesson learnt for those affected.
need to see investigation report.
there were news that some posb accounts were hacked simply cos the passcode was easily guessed from their birthdate, ic etc.
this is the reason why otp is implemented, yet such scams and hacks till occurred to this day.
slow work process.
not enough safeguards
one day u give your house keys to a guy unknowingly.
that guy then wants to enter your condominium.
the condominium security should stop that person and verify his id before letting him in.
that guy has the access card.
go by side gate .
which security guard company the condominium use?
their security guards are so well trained to recognize all the residents there   now all wearing masks too.
those who think is the victims fault are bbfa edmwers
some people are not risk averse, too hack care or clueless on what all the trade off for these conveniences.
ask him to provide data to support what he said.
not like we paying $$$.
until covid mutate.
this is the way.
it was like a rough gauge by him.
better you dunno.
my guess is 2 years
first full minister to be demoted.
that's lg ng jui peng.
the cdf after winston .
winston choo - wikipedia.
ng jui ping - wikipedia.
winston choo went on to work for chartered industries, now should be some st coy immediately after retirement.
heir to the throne.
just ask who has war experience will do.
who lost more lives during peacetime or who lost more taxpayers money during post army career lol?
drive companies to their grave counted?
surely there must be anecdotes of it?
if neck and neck speed up nothing wrong
please dont jump queue .
when people are queuing.
will you let a guy who wave and signal at you to jump queue in front of you?
at least 10 metre away
yes i experienced the same too.
whereas in private is cut staffs.
according to leong data.
if they dont do something or massage the figures.
it will be terrible if they are required to present some data of some sorts.
but if these people go into the work force, they will be under paid for the current cost of living expected ,( better than no pay) and they would waste their best working yrs of their lives away.
is but a wet dream.
how much you pay him?
his first job, $3.
if u so good why he quit?
he do not have chance.
i rem 10+ years ago when i grad, engineer starting pay was 3.
what is the difference?
why generalise based on the decision of a single fresh grad?
my company has no problem paying 3.
since he was undergoing on the job training, 3.
5k was about right.
thereafter we would increase to 3.
8k or even 4k after probation depending on his performance.
how were his hours ?
you don’t eat skin?
have fish is not simple riao.
see when is father day.
i eating at dining table lmao
"we didnt want that kind of lifestyle anymore.
i’m climaxing when typing this 
now is time to finish assignment and go us to share intel with cia about the unknown status here.
that's like asking why bbfa is single
just feck off we are full.
his motive is to enjoy life, travel etc.
so its same same.
im seeing more cecas and their family at bedok reservoir.
easy come easy go
or for start why dont u move to tw or murica?
almost as if there is some monetary incentives to do so.
guess wad feedback he received?
looking to downgrade to 23/24inch fhd.
younger gen uses reddit or other forums.
here only left bbfa
oso used to work as show girls at those exhibition.
she was an edmwer?
anyone know who is this?
it was the signature of @evilduxy
a degree holder doing masters soon that is something very good i must say.
based on your height and weight you are quite overwhelming even for guys in sg, let alone gals.
really don’t see why u should feel depress.
40yo bbfa reporting.
didn’t try for local masters.
oso wanted to experience a different country….
thank you sir for your kind words.
my friends always calls me baymax 
dont be sad ok, you do facebook live, i donate stars for u.
i enjoy being married.
one must choose carefully though.
how old are you, may i ask?
why are u so insecure ?
you have the height, education and rich family background.
please stop the comparison with your peers.
be thankful that you have all these attributes .
some edmwers like evilsun, say porkgai, golem, noobdriver are in a poorer state than you .
u have the height
single is the best .
fat or muscles) then lean…
either u do something about it or focus on other things
its iphones fault .
its a called "smart phone" for a reason .
if not smart enough to detect the sms is phishing then i spend so much money to buy iphone for what ?
same goes to singtel .
i paid month for thier serices .
no consumer prottection at all .
all the bank apps are busy advertising their services in their app rather than security.
dont tell me the bank has no obligation to look after your money?
what is the most important thing is not to find fault.
if the culprits are not caught and given life sentence.
only a few years of jail after being caught.
that's why more and more joining to be scammers.
cos the risk to reward is good.
like our pap election
purpose of bank is to provide banking service.
i think majority is still bank fault.
this scam has been going on for years and worsen recently when they all move to e-token / sms log ins
mass spam only.
same thing for little kids if died in accidents.
orr chee bee chee ought to shoulder responsibility
all money transferred should be traceable from source to destination.
overseas-chinese banking corporation 
i dont think its possible to perform transactions without auth from the owner.
its possible that the phishing site was setup and the first otp could have been provided by the victim through the phishing site which the scammer then used in the real site to change the phone number that the otp was sent to?
have not eaten this before, so red .
name of the dish ?
dunno y it gives me the super unhealthy vibe
your meal looks more like breakfast
used to always eat in little india…….
anyways, is that tea in the cup?
rike eating a bowl of chilli 
eat dat red bowl hw to sleep at night?
he just need wait they activate booster shot, from 85% vaxxed to 0% vaxxed
percentage percentage percentage .
vaccines vaccines vaccines
see through this small eye cunning fellow
then their gdp will be achieved.
we forefront among countries with highest vaccination rate = we become case study for other countries when bad consequences happen despite high vaxx rates.
85% probably not enough for him.
wont be surprised he tasked the expert community  to look into vaccinated infants to increase the rate further.
now u mention, really looks like a rat .
small eyes pointy nose.
typical of a cunning evil person
today's number exceed 200 with 109 unlinked.
they are so chill about this?
now i believe we are just numbers to them.
 if tomorrow i die from covid, it will just be a +1 on their death statistics.
that's what happened when u have a incompetent team.
ya its either underlying conditions and it is inevitable.
generals who fought zero wars and maybe have not held a gun for years.
its like calling someone casanova when he haven't had secks for years.
most sakti of all 'generals'
all i remembered was that winston choo was an ambassador to somewhere.
papship sure triggered .
winston choo formal education only o level,  ask him be perm sec or senior government official is bky.
so only assign him diplomat roles on the account of his staff officer experience in army.
if general need touch gun then i scared lol.
self elected almighty empress dowager.
dedicated to army.
i dont really know the real reason .
helming ntuc very well!
do not expect him to work ot.
he is only a hands on person.
both the supervisor and i was stunned and kept quiet for a few seconds.
what’s wrong of leaving for better job?
demand and supply
we hired a utm grad.
the new gen are more used to using the mobile than using their human skills to work.
the new engineer may not be able to learn any thing from the old bird and end up not able to perform his work.
actually whats wrong?
5k pay and have to work in non air-con environment?
must add in at least $500 hardship allowance 
5k so high he dont want.
5 and no aircon, no wonder leave.
please do the needful.
please, he is on the job training and the pay is around there with a chance of increment after probation.
maybe he was bullied by the group of technicians he was assigned with.
if really as per what you said, i think is very good for fresh for acmv contractor.
unless your ot hours is ungodly.
if i freshie that time receive this type of pay and working hours in construction i will very happy.
karma for pressuring customers to sign package
squeeze as much as possible
their days are numbered.
this kind of lousy non essential service with hard sell tactics.
faster close better
fake news, nex is packed every day.
too long to read
everywhere in the world is suffering some kind of sort.
flooding in china,oman dessert 2 yrs of rain fall in 2 days causing drastic damage.
when earning money that time dont see them come out to do charity or donation.
the owner must be very rich what so why worry over just 1 month no business?
they are having no customers to cash out the voucher now.
better start offering rub a tug.
really makes your blood boyl
it is the pandemic.
it is the same everywhere else.
in fact it is their fark up attitude of not wearing mask and fond of gathering and partying that kept the pandemic longer.
if you dont agree, please leave.
ya , when sheet hit the fan , just head for the exit.
thank for leeching.
fair weather folks.
 mtf not producing outstanding results, expats are neither comfortable nor confident, so they go.
not only audis, generally conti cars have more problem.
i used to drive vw golf gt.
everytime go service and repair is min 5k and above.
now driving a humble honda.
2 brands with worst reliability audi and bmw.
the more complex the car, the more problems it has.
every electronic sensor etc installed is a problem waiting to happen.
audi, volvo and vw especially.
the infamous mechatronic?
driving a audi a6 here dont encounter any issue at all.
alot people say conti car leak engine oil and need to top up, i dont encounter such issue before.
wait till your warranty end then tok.
keeping finger crossed.
 same goes for bmw.
they are in the business of selling cars, maintenance, and parts
this is so true
ex colleague drives 5yr old a6, he carries a bottle of engine oil in his boot.
btw, the audi eat eo was previous gen issue.
i think newer gens dont haf.
some oil will seep into the combustion chamber.
my old a4 eat eo like sai.
one week top up almost 1l.
just top up some money and buy porsche, problems solved.
save some $$ as well.
what if 90% of such transactions are actually legit?
one thing is for sure.
customer gong gong enter bank accounts details.
if not you’ll be scolded for wasting their time.
this discourages people to pay attention in what they are doing.
i’m confident this won’t happen.
edit: regardless of engineering, mice, etc.
dont trust and dont use digital banking cos sms otp is not secure.
you wont know.
so system to detect?
bank could have hold the transaction.
i made a warning on 24th dec on my whatsapp groups lol.
how are the scammers able to have knowledge of web services api, local banks 2fa , and deploy such intricate scheme without triggering detection systems ?
our bank security are run by aliens.
is nose simpur
no damage control at all?
is this time for bbfa to shine?
90% negative topics
sure, i'd be happy to test their holes.
every single hole on their body.
even thousands of edwm hate thread against him will not stop him.
israel is useless.
i think the art self test kit is not painful.
just stick the piece slightly into the nose (no need to be deep), twirl a few times and its ok.
its different from the pcr thing that they poke the stick into the very inner depths of the nostrils.
ibs will ask u to compare with other countries where there are thousands upon thousands of cases.
she born in tiger year.
i told him be grateful for what he has.
ssfa here that i mentioned their names are at a more disadvantaged position as compared to him.
you,  @sayporkguy @evilsun , @noobdriver , @pikapika33
slim and lean i think best.
many girls not as shallow as guys.
yes de im going to do something about it.
going for limb surgery soon to gain 10cm of height
thank you  i am trying to cut down my weight to about sub-100kg.
my ideal is 85ish.
what about evilsun and pikapika uh?
i know saypork and noobdriver are <1.
be more confident .
when you are in china, do look out for your diet as the weather is cold.
it is easier for you to gain weight there easily .
i think as long as u reduce your weight, try to change your dress code and hairstyles should be a small improvements.
where u find such a group de?
do both cardio and strength training, but most importantly do at your own comfortable pace and to avoid injuries.
pika is cross dresser  i have no idea why he does that but it brings joy to edmwers
go find some guy who has gone through the divorce process and is now paying monthly maintenance and ask him to share the full gory details with you.
how badly do you want to be attached?
are you willing to do something about it, or are you just whining about it here?
love is a useless meme.
surgery for what?
rather people accept who u are than go for surgery.
be true to yourself.
you will be wearing thermal and extra clothing followed by a winter wear .
it will look better for you cos the additional of clothes hide away the bigger size of your build
what you need is plenty of money and good health to enjoy it.
love is overrated.
much better than any of the 4g.
ridiculous media trying to scare people in order to sell more vaccine.
wow who are these 13?
more people die due to suicide.
why are we not putting a stop to those?
i thot all those that die are all old people.
u mean all the people ghost there are old people?
ftom the market?
how about vaccine death?
how old were those people who died?
due to covid or underlying conditions?
so first few nv report.
wait until 13 then report?
so weird of you to quote suicide cause suicide is something different from covid.
might as well quote car crash, drowning.
hmmm sounds fishy.
so all those old people that die recently are from that cluster?
doesn’t make sense
i could fap to those eyes all day.
still like e original by madonna.
i think this is what make her famous back then.
but i dunno if she learn her dance moves from wow or wow copied her dance moves for the elves.
not bad not bad.
is she still virgin?
nothing beats madonna
gif us je en marre.
merci beaucoup ts, elle est une vraiment jolie fille.
vous êtes les bienvenus, en effet elle est très belle .
thanks for sharing .
sell after warranty dont buy second hand
you want satki than you must accept the pain.
i like this positive attitude.
update us again when you reached 5 years mark.
conti car out of warranty period better sell.
worst is those folks who go and buy coe conti cars.
clutch wear out faster
wats your mileage?
how much is a refurb audi mu or 7dsg?
frend bought a second hand a8l told me quite cheap as owner difficult to sell it.
drove till scrap
clutch alone is 2k.
mech unit about 3-4k.
maybe refurb half the price?
good luck to those owners then
i have tracked his weekly progress.
maybe you dunno about this, but there is a quick and easy way to see what the future prospect of a company is.
is that guy having a good life?
is he earning a high pay?
maybe just casually ask, what car he drives?
how's his family life?
and you become no value-add.
thus y  share lol.
work in hot and stuffy environment, $3.
all grads have to suck up to u and say yes
5k  work 8-5pm no ot from m-f, but need on site and in dusty environment and hot.
which u will ask your kid to choose.
especially during this pandemic period, wfh much better and safer
actually he left early now is better than waste everyone's time after completed all the training.
for the record, i do not think the pay is fantastic at 3.
i think its fair as the company is currently employing him to train and for the tasks he is doing right now, we could have employed a fresh technician at 2.
the company had high hopes in cultivating him, improving his career prospects and the next generation of engineers.
maybe he need guidance from you more than the supervisor whom he is supposed to whack when he passed his probation.
why your co nv groom supervisor to reach the required skill sets?
he doesnt seem to have the drive to learn anyway.
better then train for few months or a year then resign what
i believe you are saying that the supervisor do not have the paper qualification for the role.
did you inform the new engineer of the actual working condition during the interview or you are not involved in the interview ?
seems like there is some mis-communication or the noob lied about being able to do the work in the harsh environment.
i think that the present gen is pretty straight forward.
they will resign immediately.
their parents will be able to feed them.
my mom done cash deposit to uob using the automatic deposit machine using her own atm card.
the cso supervisor then voided the old form and amend the description.
uob cso said it could be someone else account but my mom put in cash.
but this is a technical error and not a wrong transfer of sum.
my mom wass adviced to wait for about a month for uob to investigate and conclude.
not sure if anyone experienced such situation and what are the options besides waiting for uob to come back?
im skeptical that uob just revert with "case close" after a month of wait.
i suggest you to file a police report
i thought insert am card will be own account.
how much is that amount?
insert own atm card.
key in personal pin.
how could this error be technically possible when she inserted her atm card?
let them investigate loh.
this sounds like a major atm/comp.
cos when you do a cash deposit there will be an option "deposit to own account?
and if you press no, you key in the other party's account.
provided what u said is true.
this kind better file police report then put big big on fb/mothership/xin ming/wan bao/.
ts maybe your mum did this then entered the wrong account number.
file police report
then what you want them to do~?
call wanbao, mum ship, mas.
pawn them deep.
i am trying to hit the gym more often nowadays (trying to do 5x a week) mostly cardio.
that’s my main worry…to be at 30 and still single
no need to scare him he is still a young chap.
love might find him at the most unexpected moment.
we need to encourage him more than trying to give him negative comments on dating and marriage
i prefer (double) filet-o-fish
what kind or cardio u doing?
i used this method to lose 20kg.
bfast cereal, those healthy types.
lunch i eat whatever i want.
need to be in good mood to exercise happily.
dinner, cereal again.
but i go gym 7 days.
 member of fitness first.
i do body combat, rpm and body pump.
need to build muscles, dont just do cardio
it could be due expectation mismatch.
80/20 rules always exist.
women and men who are still in denial of their own standard will be single , aiming for the 20% which doesn’t exist anymore
cut down on sugar, sugar is the real killer on weight gain
instead of forcing yourself to go 5x a week, try to aim at least 3x a week instead?
just cardio alone wont help much de.
dont fret too much, as someone who believes in fatalism, what will come, will come!
why mod dont wait until cny end then issue?
u will huat for the entire year
serve as reminder dont anyhow post for the niu year 
what did you post?
if you tattoo the mod name that given you the infraction pts on your penis.
it will be huat for you on the coming years.
you counter his curse.
dont mind the points but scare the timing only.
for what offend
what pic did u post?
lol the mistress cross examine the wife.
we will see more death soon, our icu would be quickly overwhelmed at this rate.
we arent doing anything to actually prevent those absolutely.
majority should be fine with it anyways.
my family has achieved "herd immunity".
100% of my family members are fully vaccinated.
a pack of wolves.
a flock of sheep.
should sue the outsource coy.
surprising 63% (so far) thinks its the banks fault.
those voted yes are noobs .
should i move my funds back to dbs?
i only received on dec 30 and jan 5.
23 to warn of a surge in these scams.
30, to warn of a potential surge in attacks over the new year weekend”
its their fault for releasing the fund and not detecting anomaly.
should have a sms message.
are u sure to proceed with this xfer.
i has to be their fault partially, if it isn’t then why would they implement such measures after this incident?
here we go again.
33% stupid user fault.
33% telco fault for divert sms hack
unless consecutive 50 times 100.
but sum more then 50 percent is anomaly
cos the scammers impersonated the bank, .
conned the account holders into giving details to facilitate them to impersonate the account holders to con the bank into executing the transactions under the impression that they were the ‘instructions of the account holders’?
so what would be the threshold?
i am not sure everyone’s risk threshold?
like usual month is xfer 1k around monthly for the pass 10 month.
this month 50k.
anomaly is just unusual from the normal past data.
do you wish to proceed xfer 50k question.
cos only 1 fully vaxxed died.
be like the people in the uk.
this is the new normal.
u all better go n think again .
or are we just a natural vaccine sucker?
all kiasee as usual.
suicide, car crash and drowning, they do not spread.
sing solo no nice
so they are colleague with cr7 now?
nicely written lyrics, like a poem, everything reverse
vocal not bad in cover version.
this is only 1 half of the duo, what happened to the other half?
really is friendly and just want to do music.
their concert is the best!
actually its more than the paper.
engineers need to understand drawings and vet system designs.
probably the newbies impression of the work is different from actual work.
i promise to follow the boss everywhere 
terkan to force him out.
anyway thanks edmw.
he do not even have a diploma.
he is only a hands on person, as good as nitec.
i would do that too if my rice bowl is threatened.
his rice bowl was not threatened.
this type of toxic character.
not surprised your engr run road.
the rest 25% are in engineering design firms so more office based & going down the pe track.
those on site always cite the same excuse, mediocre pay (or same pay as those office counterparts) while they pull in 6 day weeks with long hours.
its not so much the hours as the pay itself.
since everyone agree that you dont really need much of what you learn in uni to do your job.
like, maybe ask ramesh and misha, too.
lky had the right idea.
not all jobs require you to understand and use fourier transform, for example.
or advanced calculus.
so what happens?
and everybody is unhappy.
maybe hire a ceca to pawn him.
your engineer is those bookworm.
but your technician supervisor is seasoned old bird.
the saying goes; the older the ginger, the hotter it becomes.
hiring contract, all the terms to hantum the employee is all there.
the company wants to slowly groom in-house pes to increase our capabilities.
but most importantly, they have to suit our company.
i promise to buy coffee for breakfast and shine the shoes too.
it is not that your refrigeration system is very complicated.
if rich enough, just go buy brand new.
im driving a 3.
same engine what
jap car maybe only oil leak after several years.
suv drivers are less rough with their cars.
high cg the cornering not as good
bmw e60 and previous still ok.
drive 3 years better sell.
  personal experience with all of the above models.
bought and drove an audi once.
every other month in workshop.
and have to top up engine oil as frequently as i top up petrol.
changed to jap cars and no more issues.
plus the jap cars i bought are not as petrol guzzling as my audi.
engine oil disappearing issue is usually due to leaking piston rings.
most engines above a certain age will do that, including japanese.
japanese engines - owners tend to drive more gently.
vin starts with l.
german technolovy go down the drain leow.
but longevity isnt a criteria when the car industry rates these engines.
i bought my audi brand new, not a single issue after 2 years and running.
those friends who updated to conti.
all say they dont want to go back to jap/kr car.
owned by tata motors.
someone need to start selling blinker fluid.
japanese work culture very ke lian 
in before edmw "i wanna marry her"
i am just stating the facts.
i am telling him not to compare as i feel bad for ssfa in this forum when truth hurts for them.
for ts, such issue is minor as compared to evilsun, saypg, noob and gang
i am currently an anytime fitness member since may.
~5km inclined brisk walk].
(still don’t have the stamina to run).
thank you sir, my family are middle income.
in this day and age, no reason for that.
 there's always the option of paying a girl to spend time with you   
no doubt that is possible.
enjoy first k, so dont rush to slim down so fast.
enrich your life with experiences now is more important
thank you sir for your advice.
sure you surf edmw at age 15
in the end   love urself and people around u is more likely happen
that is transactional and not genuine, not what im looking for 
wow it’s been that long….
yep i initially came on to edmw-hwz to ask on further education advice and on which path should i choose after my n levels in sec 4
25 is a nice age.
then marry at 30.
about right…i hope to tie the knot at or just before 30 as well…
when you are trapped in a marriage, you will auto try to reach out.
either that or jump off a building (not kidding)
then do something abt it.
check yourself in the mirror n see where goes wrong or r u seeking in the right direction for gf
30 is a good age.
i replied you earlier on this.
now is the time to learn to date.
there are skills to learn.
things to improve on internally.
like your outlook on life.
your ability to hold a conversation.
you'd be surprised.
not money diggers who are only interested in you when you have money.
and i am not talking dinobu.
many are pretty flowers.
colour not healthy 
finish off with this .
huai no add fish cake and pig stomach?
5 i think is ky
their pau is overpriced
i like the yam too
those gcp foods.
and show them on edmw.
one piece 50 cent?
de cai bor rooks goode
no harm trying this.
singapore‘s it security has, in general, been really weak for years.
data leaks, insider scams, telco sms spams, endless calls from +65….
 still want to be regional financial hub when their security is so poor.
i received only 1 sms on 5 jan.
it seems they are giving wrong info to the public.
100 million compensate for security breech from cognizant hcl.
there is no backend ai capabilities to track/show a huge spike going into an overseas account.
somemore the scammer literally wipe out the whole account.
the bank is not even asking anything.
google has this ip thingy.
will ask user.
seems like you have login into google using a new ip address, email you asking if its you.
its an anomaly.
they have it i guess but maybe didnt turned on/not working.
actually the limit increase without the need for otp is the killer.
otherwise losses would be limited to only the daily limit
if the money is not mine, its the user's fault.
there are cases where users did nothing.
money still gone.
i received the dbs $20 bicentennial note sms, i did click the link to check on the website and key in fake id.
since nothing to lose, why not go aloha those head honchos of the bank & their families.
they need to be pushed
if this happen to me, pretty sure is my mum supposed to fulfill some obligation but gambled/give away the money and come up with ridiculous excuse.
lol very hard to justify unless the person willing to credit to you back.
i suppose she deposited to someone account before it was logged out, that means she inserted her atm card after the deposit.
sound weird but highly likely.
just put transfer from my acct to my acct .
or transfer deposite to this acct .
you mean the atm system did not “log out” from the previous user’s account?
end up in someone else account.
better make police report & inform mothership
how about uob ?
the person must return .
it is an offence not to.
people have been charged for this before.
not easy cos you'll face police pressure.
but essentially you have to return the money if wrongly received.
few weeks to a month.
not an offense.
easy to say bank account didnt check amount.
there is your answer
yes this is true.
i had such an experience before.
a chap left his card and i was next wanted to withdraw.
oso called out to her.
criminal misappropriation - 403
these pple really jelly.
watching online video etc.
why no ban smoking?
why not ban alcohol?
pay money still want question what?
u r eating the food
no to dine in forever.
let's do our part to keep hawker and foodcourt.
you have a point.
cause dine in, remove mask, then up case again.
no more eating, no more entertainment.
just work and pay tax.
very safe from virus.
isn’t life wonderful?
ban dine but unban work in office
count down to bistro-in​
i dont think the cost will be more than the amount being scammed.
pap fault for so pro business there is 0 consumer rights here.
click link is user fault.
please payback money
see the cast vote.
really like the 60 plus percent who vote for it and kaopei.
click link is user fault.
if you continue to put money there it defeats the whole purpose of keeping money safe in a bank.
the vote count like pappy supporters
maybe their boss say radio silence until they know what is going on    
all bank should have a quick way to freeze own account for such case.
maybe not in the next few years.
pull down mask chua sai.
for some lucky people it comes naturally.
its not easy.
you should be doing exactly what you are doing right now.
keep churning gfs.
you are on the right track.
this is what i did.
then you will be more determined to work on your marriage.
not look for alternatives.
when things go awry - and marriage is seldom smooth - they dont have your experience to draw from.
they "itch" for other women.
you’re those quite insecure and quiet guys is it?
23 yo only woo 3 girls is quite little.
just use dating apps and cast your net.
quiet yes…i am generally very introverted unless i know you well.
in terms of insecurity, i guess it might be that vibe that i gave the 3rd girl that’s why she grew tired of me.
any tips or suggestions?
i tried all the different dating apps le (cmb, tinder, okc, tantan) but feel like they are either 1.
very superficial 2.
what your height?
wait, you must earn more than them first.
serve 2 years ns.
loss of income is 48k to 200k for guys lol.
truly a privilege.
earn the money and find someone within 5 years younger than you.
there are guys in 40s here still unmarried
i would like to believe that there are genuine people on the app who are trying to find long term partners there.
i guess with all these “distractions”, y’all are finding it hard to find each other.
i think in order to lose the superficial feeing, you need to form genuine connection as friends first.
this is probably the hardest part through dating apps.
precisely, by that very post he has totally destroyed every shred of credibility that his advice or whatsoever has provided previously .
really doing a disservice to the younger generation of males in singapore, reported to mod 
her name is call covid 19, she is 19 years old and love you until died!
and she will forever with you and accompany you to hell too!
dont break her heart bro.
u no career no condominium no car.
he dont have to give him problem.
or maybe dont even need to, your junior engineer on job working probably saw or felt it.
that means your pay to him is not attractive enough
you very naive to think this way .
leave this detail out purposely 
if want conti, please buy brand new
and sell away before 5 year is up.
wear and tear like bearings and seals will wear off causing blow by and oil consumption.
why conti cars so lousy?
i intend to buy conti coe cars.
better than 2nd hand jap cars!
paging for sammiegirl for more insight.
under our weather and humidity = problematic cars.
japan has seasons like european countries.
japan's winter no less harsh than europe's.
hard truth is that japanese cars build quality is far better
oso wear n tear is expensive for premium conti
fleet of toy cars.
the problems are vicious cycle.
is truth that once you goes conti you dont go back jap.
even right now after 1 year back in jap car.
the next moment i release.
i've owned and driven extensively conti, kimchi and jap.
jap certainly is more reliable.
but contis just bring a smile to your face when driving.
need to reinstate their suspended doctors to help out
why they so stoooopig wan?
where is the nicest czechar?
i like crab master best.
which part of punggol is the most beautiful?
i dont live there
punggol is nice.
shame about the people there.
is all i want to say.
anyone tried punggol nasi lemak?
in before "dont be areacism".
must be inclusive of the whole of sinkapore
where you live
i only know punggol park is in hougang
dont talk cock.
you live with your parents right?
there is an indian international school in punggol hence there are .
straight thru process….
its easy for you or anyone to say but the cost to implement will be high.

[very disappointed] no pic thread again
…first world problem
ferraro rocher jhj
maybe left over from lunar seven month
if really see you no up, would have given you van houten or kitkat.
very disappointed with your “buyed”
this ts is the new yak chin?
looks like i need to upgrade my goodies.
its the thought that count.
the moment the screen asks what else you want to do?
ts i not totally convinced by your mother's story.
better to verify again.
im asking if anyone had encounter such issue which bank holds you up 1 whole month to investigate.
by then the cctv recording likely would have been overwritten.
maybe that machine card reader has been rigged.
no matter whose card u insert, it will always go to a specific account.
then very scary.
which is the concern some of the records or even cctv video may be overwritten.
by they raise this incident initially as if my mom fault to transfer wrongly and need to request receiving account holder to agree the transfer back.
not like dbs (which is cos it give you option to deposit and withdraw)
to be honest, this is such a weird situation that 99% of people have trouble believing.
i advise to make police report to force uob to expedite.
the police is not edmw.
statement taking is not just ask 1 or 2 question, you answer correctly case closed.
they will ask a number of background questions.
they will look at cctv footage of you, the person before you and after.
i had a friend who received money wrongly and spent it.
but the bank notified him that he would have to return the money and he agreed.
if he said no, after the fact has been proven that it wasn't his money he would be charged.
unless it’s personally key in the acct, there’s a possibility of kyng a wrong acct number….
reminds me a time, use a bank app.
skimmer is steal your card info.
totally different from what ts is describing
honestly hard to believe the story.
you dont be surprise alot of people do that
all we know is that the virus is super infectious and is now spreading like wild fire.
this guy shows his face and the company uniform.
this is not about stirring, we have to safeguard singapore, our home.
customer order with them when they have no mask on face (one side on ear) then they proceed to make drinks.
another is not wearing any doing pancakes.
so if u think only fw u r wrong.
or the young chaps in restaurant kitchen not wearing any masks!
eating in kitchen!
or the cashier not wearing mask n eating at counter.
feedback - sfa.
only factory workers dont wear mask?
i thought they are everywhere now
lulz, i predicted spread by public toilet.
true true, they are everywhere.
but for this case, the noodles will be delivered to singaporean's primary dining source.
you think inside resturant and hawker .
always wear mask  or wear properly?
u mean u don’t wash the noodle then straightaway cook it?
then again who am i to judge?
it’s hot enugh being in the kitchen even without mask.
of course that’s why covid spreads.
scared this scared that.
they continued living their life.
you see europe and usa.
they pay so much money go poly, the knowledge not relevant to be hired?
either way pap has failed the nation.
unfair hiring practices .
ts dont understand?
nothing to do with education, its the unfairness (kaki nang hire kaki nang) and they come in truckloads
pay peanuts and expect alot
if even the leader of the opposition did not oppose, then whats the problem?
mom has the final say on their work permit applications.
so why is even ceca involved?
ceca dont think so.
so moving on, we just need our opposition to check on them on this issue.
eip more important ok.
it’s not easy to immigrate .
especially now !
kum gong nobody pay in full
tell moh , see what is their view .
if not go social media show all your receipts and communication messages with hotel.
jsk credit card limit.
who in his right mind will book 250?
name the hotel or this is all csb
so dont wear so big swimming trunks
service not provided no?
why do we want to hold a banquet for 25 tables?
are all of those 250 people there really happy for you?
i would rather just invite close family and friends to a max of 2 tables at a nice restaurant for a meal and scoot off to a month-long honeymoon
dont think fren telling him the whole true ba
if is good credit card company with excellent customer protection policy and service.
he should contact his cc company immediately.
then open 25 tables and perform social distancing with 2 to 3 pax per table then.
waiting for your tips
have some dignity.
dont be like those losers who keep begging him to appear in the other thread.
good things come to those who wait.
if dont have dont worry i sponsor u .
family viewing a unit there .
i really really don’t want to live there .
moving the whole family there .
and rent this amk away.
i feel like living alone .
but my parents keep nagging
ts which ponggol rc u working at?
dont confuse love with companionship.
i dunno what data you have or what experience you speak of.
here is my data.
i am not good looking.
i rate my looks as 6.
neither am i tall or successful in my career (i.
but i have countless gfs and partners.
from air stewardess to secretaries to bankers.
most 8/10 to 10/10 in the looks department.
yet they prefer fugly me.
it threatens my marriage.
i wont go into the details.
i turned both down.
and i am at a ripe old age of 50 now!
not outer appearances.
or conclude there are no such thing as sweet grapes.
i reckon women are like a supermarket.
you are probably looking in the wrong section too.
ts please go buy a mirror and look at own self in mirror.
you'll thank yourself when you see your friends start going through divorce and child custody proceedings.
meanwhile, all your wealth belongs to just you.
when u post like this.
y no mention what type u looking for?
your mommy will always love you.
i think so too 
whats the group called?
give you a chance.
edmw bbfas is always here for you .
why you spend so much time 1 hr on the treadmill?
given your age of 23, that’s not going to do anything.
you need to quickly start doing the weights as soon as possible to see visible results.
walking around for 1 hr on treadmill is just wasting time for you.
though i dunno you i’m just assume you are healthy.
spend less time on edmw .
not all though, some found companionship, some found breakup/divorce.
imagine compromising with someone the rest of your life, just to have a companion.
but why scared?
it’s not unforeseeable isn’t it?
gong xi gong xi
yea i know, but i don’t understand.
just let the virus run free, no?
they just trying their luck.
hoping for the best.
but not prepared for the worst.
should measure icu cases instead.
tourism is like what 30% of the thai economy.
30% gone means millions of jobs gone, millions no food to eat.
some people for some inexplicable reason just seem to want borders to remain shut forever.
they should not look at the numbers.
thai needs oyk.
open some more.
overseas exchange programmes and internships are key to equipping our students to thrive in a globalised world.
sg) when travel resumes.
what about india?
shouldn't we foster ties and cultural understanding at an early age there too, especially as lhl is an early believer.
so what is the outcome?
hoho means more ceca to fill the position here
996 stressful lifestyle on top of food,air safety concerns.
and not for xiamen or guangzhou or swatow.
i wont be surprised at least a few thousand parents would be interested in this.
 i am being conservative cos it might be tens of thousands.
our forefather will be proud of us.
while ceca come here earn big buck
just deposit only.
hate this type of irresponsible people.
im sorry about other people
ask them fine them goood good
these should be fined
seen some pulled down their masks to sneeze, multiple sneezes at a time.

unless those kum gong wear a mini mask for their fat farking face that squeeze against their lips
before my brain fried i told her not i not interested.

so no need talk on phone
read the article.
its frm ceca mouth
we have high ranking uni & cambridge paper.
vote pap out for better future without ceca
why give birth to me 
its really those companies who do such things
instead of learning programming skills in young age we have useless subjects like social study.
moe didnt have the foresight led to this mass import of ceca for it
after more than 10 years and we still importing.
meaning nothing is improved
your transcripts is snake oil proof
in exchange of investments?
v edmwer thing to do.
stirring to protect our countrymen.
ya right, continue living their normal lives, but we have not seen the aftermath of 'freedom'.
the time is just not ripe yet.
you mean you washed your noodles before cooking it?
 and the packaging may be in contact with the virus.
wet market stall selling tofu/noodles should have.
this is done to increase efficiency.
put himself in trouble  
what kind of trouble has he put himself into?
myanmar ban mian anyone?
the british citizens stranded in kabul - podcast.
but his wife and children live in kabul.
in august, with his wife heavily pregnant, he flew back to be with them, believing there would be time to bring them back to the uk if anything went wrong.
but the baby was born even as the taliban began to seize control of afghanistan’s cities.

covid time still wanna invitation
kumgong pay full.
there's a % to pay prior wedding and after.
bbfa is live old
who did he vote for?
1 see mp, make things big big.
it may be 30 percent in terms of gdp but it’s effect is much greater in terms of employment esp in some areas.
phuket for eg.
the domestic  service  sectors are dependent on income which follows indirectly into the sector ie locals who spend money having earned them in the tourism sector.
hence their desperation at opening up, there is simply no alternative.
people are relying on charities for meals.
kids are going to school hungry
the sandbox project is really doomed to fail
now not even 1 month.
instead of tourists go there spend money.
left to die in own house?
what more to expect for a small could try to endemic and open up to the world without quarantine.
ya probably hitting hospital capacity then reactive.
number of cases does not matter
pretty sure they know its coming.
this vaccine not so effective against delta variant
they should be asking hospital directors and doctors
@singapore government please look at this
at least they tried.
business bad thus no surcharge
learn to cut own hair now.
dont like wear mask and book in advance to a hair cut.
the salons charges extra 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after
means actually no need surcharge but want to squeeze u dry dry.
great, fuck them & their cny surcharge .
people no money to cut hair this cny?
all spent on extra virgin olive oil.
there are still hair salons with no surcharge if you bother to look for them.
if hair svc all x 2 during cny, might as well go malls to do
i dont mind pay but i hate they spend 30min just to cut a normal high slope.
need to cut public hair
asking for a friend by the way.
if she dont want then ask other's gf

if need to ask then dont bother.
and blow fire all the time.
seeing his face irks me.
train more ccp comrades.
what are the benefits of ceca india?
atb de cp jhj 
the only minister of education thus far that actively promotes brain drain.

train up and show them your six packs.
your friends will then call u brock lesnar.

maybe  but i feel edmw bros here give good advice
focus on improving urself, me no money to even consider dating until early 30s
married = love?
attached = love?
saying i love you = love?
dont be naive.
this is a society where we make use of each other.
love is just an illusion.
that is what i feel too 
huais rikes thats?
is water or taps problems?
i think that should be it.
ts live on high floors where water comes down from tank?
clogs shos fasts means huats?
looks fierce n wild type

what is wrong with people now a days
something about this gender that loves to find trouble in publik
is she name 'karren' or 'poon'?
police found out that woman who dont put on mask.
that why it is their unhygienic habit
covid bring out the madness or its a new psychological illness caused by covid or the lockdown?

no, we dont have time to care about climbers now.
sigh very sad for kimchi kor kor
salute him, he died in  pursuing what he believes in knowing his disability is against him ( i am sure he is aware the danger).
this is an example of not having high vaccination rates.
not apple to apple
pap lub all fts n tourists
no monitor no headache!
no more income for the jet ski scam
friend told me 4 people were tested postive for covid yesterday when they arrived in koh samui.
2 were thai with 1 az jab and the other 2 are europeans with 2 jabs of pfzier.
the lucky thing is samui sandbox so far has less than 100 oversea tourist since the 15th july.
most freedom centric admk will want to have fun that’s why open up phuket for them.
local government probably more worried about local people that’s why the closure.
might as well.
why didnt they direct to morgue and -1 count?
they open to tourism.
end up is locals spreading covid around.
what vaccine they used?
cos even “almost closed” australia which accepts only 3,000 arrivals a week is struggling with lockdowns now.
and what does ns philosophy say?
just tough it out for a while only.
then we will live in 2 worlds, 1 covid-free world, and 1 endemic world.
australia burst precisely cos they imported the virus on a flight, that's their downfall.
you might as well use debit card.
debit card is dangerous.
i dunno about whether he has 250 people.
but we have 250 people here sleeping well tonight
tell your fren:.
ts wanted to save face and mentioned his friend instead.
pay with credit card, just chargeback
if your limit is 1 k and you have cash 10 k, and you pay 10k into your cc account, your credit limit becomes 11k.
quite surprised lots of people dunno this.
spend 10k pay 10k before the due date, u immediately have 10k limit again.
 ngei ngei want to invite max.
just name and shame on social media.
very kumgong of your friend.
ts your friend is his problem.
why you worry for him?
this type of job not easy.
all his other post seems to be in burmese.
what kind of job is easy with the mask on?
nowaday quite a handful of burmese, viet, at, hk, pinoy and jhk working here
this kind of noodle factory usually is sole proprietary or family business.
the hr will be multi-tasked.
on sundays and ph, dont even think of going into their meeting ground.
perhaps 1 x feedback = stir sh*t.
kumgong let garbarment sexploit.
who did he vote for.
then kope opinion from their favourite ministers about this.
don’t understand his message.
its their privilege worz.
who they voted for?
your mum waiting for you at the gate.
this is not tekong?
lol as if other country will respect what time a soldier knocks off.
clearly she see saf nothing mroe than a boarding school.
first world problems.
why keep importing covid.
army so xiong, must coddle by mummy.
then i select a message, .
its cos whatsapp is not working properly on your phone.
please buy a new phone and use the new phone.
after that, donate your old phone to me.
thanks in advance.
what phone are you using?
are you on android?
u using fake whatsapp?
from my understanding, your recipient whatsapp app needs to support this feature for u to do it
most likely is the phone.
there is a time limit to delete messages for everyone.
yes thats what i read from a website
who did ts vote for?
your answer is there
this message has been deleted
its a 2020 model what
or neber read what the search results show.
dunno what to say about ts question .
regret telling the girl you love her right?
1h is not useful better do some weight training
sometimes is the time.
not yet arrived.
cardio is useless for body-building if you're skinny.
increasing your muscle mass improves your metabolism and helps you lose weight easier.
in the end become fa.
the amount of money used to tackle a wifey (with no guarantee she finally will merry u)  is definitely more than all the investment used to merry a import wifey.
perhaps begin the journey within, where u find endless change within, then u'll be dispassioned
whats wrong with bbfa ?
nothing sad about being forever alone.
welcum to bergin crub.
there is no benefit to being forever alone.
i find your post very insightful.
oso what are the critical questions to ask her first before going official?
means kiao ka until 9 aug
i was really surprised when radio was still advertising the open house over the weekend.
closing country gate still pending.
elite life is really very precious.
peasants life dont care and dont pollute the royal garden.
but flights from india still coming
i want to like a post from this thread suddenly it missing.
they knw something we do not.
grammar police do your thing!
bro your hdb cost more than my entire family net worth 
if so, dont compare with him.
not apple to apple comparison.
what brand and model bro?
then is money wasted
book cruise with a girl .
if want to book cruise and expect pika, u are better off finding those on call
i prefer to read physical book.
the book is very discreet after removing the cover.
im still at chapter 1.
i am a little more than chapter 1.
then i will have time to read
and book an addition room .
throw the slug overboard

praise the government.
by the way post pic and sic ig?
but you still bbfa ;(
ask hotel do delivery.
your friend so bold?
see if they care
split 2 sessions.
do lunch and dinner session
dont believe ts.
sometimes all this young couples so adamant about holding a banquet.
its covid period.
why still wanna go the trouble to hold a banquet?
why need all this attention for what?
just rom for legality and do away with banquets.
must be the bride want attention, wanna make up pretty pretty etc etc let people see.
some couples do this to "feel important".
we dont even care after that.
why the hassle especially during covid times?
like crypto market now.
here's the thing.
that's right, from the victims.
all the lucky people still dunno the free riding effect they are having on the society.
people who caught the delta covid are literally dying in their homes
sounds so familiar.
some people for some inexplicable reason just believe that as long as their desire to open up is strong enough, they don’t have to face the reality that they haven’t recover from a pandemic.
maybe some of the tourists come come countries that sell fake vaccinations certificates.
maybe some of the vaccinated tourists are actually infected but show zero symptoms on arrival to phuket.
its definitely not unexpected
people who are poor and no money to eat have their own reason to open up.
just cos you are not hungry enough cos really no money to eat does not makes you any special.
rather have 2% chance to die from covid then 100% chance to die of starvation
prayut keen to showcase.
hopefully countries watch and not learn.
no herd immunity
9% of people lives, 0.
1% die, is kind of acceptable from the politically correctness view point.
without covid, same amount of people would have perished for some other reasons anyway, for example road accidents.
many are worried about the adverse effects of the vaccination in longer term, it is a valid concern.
we will become a nation that is full of highly competitive people, without an economy structure to support their needs and wants.
life will be 5-10 times harder than now, tax will be 2-3 time higher, happiness index will definitely drop.
i dont think this is what people wanted to see.
whole day worry about ktv f&b licenses, you guys must be kidding.
aug is really our independence day
and this is all ignoring the part where there are countries with local economies fully running, no masks, no restrictions, only with no immigrants.
and they're all vaccinated already, where do you go from there?
even then they may have foreign monkeys trespassing once in s a while, without pcr test and passport some more.
its not a hypothetical, its reality in a few countries, they have opened fully already, no masks, no restrictions of any kind locally.
and why do we need to depend on others for survival?
that's all pretend only.
no, vaccines is not the answer, such a solution doesn't exist.
ho ching mentioned new potential vaccines that we might be using, bharat (covaxin) straight out of the box only 65% vs delta, and its only phase 3 results, not released yet.
haven't release and fail already, just not fast enough.
oh mai~ clement korkor is a bear type~
you want to old cow eat young grass?
why you triggered ?
what is there to hiam.
so if i gain 10kg during the pandemic will be covid-10?
i was a bui bui even few years back    .
at least these 2 spend time exercising.
next became bui bui with a pot belly 
apparently the guy is otaku gamer n is very smart in school.
ended up raped his girlfriend when she wanna breaks up with him.
44am he decided today is the day to kill his gf.
oh nose oh nose
wlwlsmdwl, i wanna to istana ssll.
karma of having president selected by race?
from st's fb :.
bro, dettol not 100% effective.
i suggest you boil a pot of water and dip in it.
use insect repellent 
wa some so high?
i thought as in general.
i think, its cultural issue.
before that they had the highest birth rate rofl
my guess is that young women these days don’t care much about having kids and having a family.
they are more focused on their careers.
38pm is unearthly hour?
is her son still bottle fed 3 times a day?
should be commanders right?
our army is like cca in secondary school but for adults.
probably still breastfeeding the son.
what the heck is milestone parade?
either parents kaypo insist to pick the guy or the guy is spineless.
either way is hopeless.
tell her to see her mp 
technically still within that 2 years ma
double yellow lines.
lta do yoir jogs
then mon morning all have to go back to work
she seem like just 20+ or in early 30s.
women have multiple paths.
i guess in life, regardless whether male or female, some will earn more some will earn less.
seems like all hold quite high position
now wonder locals guy feel less confident since local girls earn more than guys.
not to mention they actually have +2years advantage ….
the prettier and sexier earn most.
yes, very common.
wife earn more than husband too.
taboo topic, nobody spoke about in public
self fulfilling prophercy
but do not gaslight her to a point she questions her sanity.
do it lightly with a noble purpose of being with her.
i have had countless women in my life.
as a father of 2 teenage girls now, i am ashamed of my past.
but i am what i am.
do not do this after you are married.
the repercussions are severe.
no questions please.
sometimes after bedding her, the position is still not clear.
there is no hard and fast rule.
who likes commitments on something to be enjoyed?
i do not have a number on the times we dated.
she was my bff and a married woman with child.
it is very hard to resist an attractive married woman.
you stumble yourself by coining the term "official".
read my previous post.
23 will vert fast become 26, then 30 then 35.
i’ve seen guys trying to portray confidence and ended up looking like a complete asshole.
what u gonna do ?
there is group chat for such thing?
how the girl will know u want to go out with her?
just do not adopt the same mindset as andy bbfas.
just living life monotonously.
girls usually know what they dont like but struggle with things/people they like or going to like.
thank you for finding some parts useful.
if your question pertains to morals, not approach, my answer as such.
read it above again.
one part has to yield.
i dont go in with the intention of wasting her time.
i admit, some times it is just lust.
i am not perfect.
i have a conscience.
so nobody is disadvantaged.
love and dreams
my wife knows i am in that group and very active.
there are lots to be learnt from group sharings.
their failures, their success.
i dont see anything wrong with it, and most importantly, neither does my wife.
see it this way: at least you asked.
seldom will you find girls that will ask you out instead, am i right?
think of it this way.
it is very uncomfortable to be someone you dont like.
most times, it boils down to gut feel.
when she clicks with you, when the conversations are smooth, you will know it.
do not make it an "official" date.
it frightens her.
something like, hey, you know that famous char kway teow stall you were talking about, i am suddenly craving it.
lets go eat that tomoro ai mai?

1 diner per table.
perfect for bbfa
not a bad idea.
this is good idea
i have seen people coughing without covering their mouth while eating
then need to set timer on the seat.
1 diner for essential workers make sense.
better for me too since i always ate alone.
lol friend = ts.

somemore curry zup foc
she has made use of you.
my bro just went cruise with gf.
said super boring due to full of cecas and fts hogging everything.
even pool turned dirty with them in it.
others just need a staircase.
kick her into the sea
force yourself on her.
then you look for cruise waitress  , the singer, the cleaner etc
it should come as a package you know
someone needs to initiate i guess.
if not, i think the so called r/ship should be reaching the final episode soon.
or cruise, sleep separate rooms?
sry cruise i go 2 are all 1 big bed.
talk abt life, abt future.
sounds like very sore and very loserish.
why you guys go cruise must think so dirty?
i really like your response and the positive attitude.
running a country is very much like running a sustainability program.
edmw bbfa logic.
the cases are mainly locals despite 70% fully vaccinated .
higher vaccination rate than singapore
u mean okt pap.
we are the unwilling prostitutes.
once they open borders, the infection numbers will sky rocket.
the number of deaths will be a critical indicator on the international level.
then there is the aspect of long-term after effects of covid infection on those who recovered which only they will bare.
why are we so obsessed with the free flow of people.
not like tourism or mice events are going to come roaring back.
it seems like there's a spike in depression and suicide intentions the past year.
with this most recent closure it is going to be much worse for locals in phuket and other tourist destinations
ts dont envy for nothing.

is it compulsory?
endowment or whatever paid monthly  really needed  ?
 or just a con job by the insurers  
but most importantly insurance is not investment.
bottomline: medical/health, home fire - yes.
why u ask here?
rest is optional.
endowment is good if you want to not hands on investing.
returns is dependent on market conditions but is usually 4% for mid to long term.
yes worth it only idiot dont buy

invariably, in their quarrels, they cited their failing marriage on having kids.
i interpreted that to mean - me.
that i am the cause of their angst.
it made me suicidal.
i attempted suicide several times.
i would cut my wrist.
i had to make light of situations.
if i were to analyze everything seriously, i would have succeeded in my suicide attempts or lose it mentally.

there is no perfect girl, just like us there are no perfect men.
many times we dont even know what kind of girls we like, except for the general norm - pretty face, good figure, big breast, sweet etc.
what you need to do is to know more people.
knowing more people is good cos you make new friends and if your personality is good enough, these new friends may introduce your future girlfriend to you.
join interest groups that you like, be it cycling, hiking, nature, dancing, art, sports whatever.
the point is know more friends and spend your time meaningfully.

im 30 this year.
ts, you still have a long way to go.
know what you really want and save yourself some heartbreaks.
i honestly dont think it is hard for you to find love in this lifetime.
but i think it is going to be hard for you to find the love you think you deserve.
but rather, its important that his wife understands that he has options.
it doesn't mean he's looking to bail at the first opportunity.

i think she was promoting viagra or cialis or something.
at least she was way more entertaining to look at than the her world magazines.
after that i asked the doctor about her.
its common practice in pharma trade.

waiting to die and let neighbours smell my rotten corpse 
yes you have rightly said so.
my traumatic childhood shaped my dating views.
cos i was hurt by women and my parents failed marriage.
it is life's practical lessons.
before that, each has a choice to end it.
she has a free choice.
you may want it badly.
this is what my first girlfriend taught me.
i dated her 7 years.
gave her all assurances i will always love her (how stupid was i?
) even proposed to her.
she balked at the idea.
eventually she saw a banker colleague.
she is a banker.
didnt even have the courtesy to tell me we were off.
cos i was too predictable.
of attraction and uncertainty.
watch some korean dramas to understand why
tell us more about yourself, what are you looking for?
bbfa here, waiting for rcp to save me from my own bbfa-ness
this thread is so funny.
10 years of courtship, married since yr2001; a total of 30 years.
was a bui bui 30 years ago.
instead of subjecting your neighbours to smell your rotten corpse, why not sacrifice your body to do some charitable work before you go.
you know, mask up, meet up and let it be a sweet night for an anonymous bbfa here.
you will definitely make his day!
my waifu is my 2nd "official" gf.
i knew her in uni.
she is a private banker.
dated her 9 years.
we are now married 21 years and have 4 kids.
how did you find out?
one of the greatest lie society has taught you is that you need to "find love" in order to be happy and have a fulfilling life.
i see that there's something wrong with your mindset.
there is no such thing as 'this lifetime, next lifetime'.
i want to eat outside.
like restaurant food, hope the gal comes along
23 year old only .
still bery yang.
nothing wrong with bbfa.
no matter where i go alone, im confident i will still enjoy myself.
came in and left disappointed.
some folks wanted to buy oximeters cos their parents lost their flyers.
yet others want to make some money selling their free oximeters from temasek foundation.
** where to buy?
various common brands would go from under $10 to around $30.
for the rest who have their flyers, collection of free oximeters is over a month from day before yesterday monday 5 july, to thursday 5 august just before national day.
** where to collect?
these may be collected by presenting your flyer, with the redemption tab, or just use the redemption tab, at the participating outlets at:.
just present your flyer or redemption tab to any cashier at these outlets.
the physical tab is kept as part of quick audit for reconciliation.
yup, there is sometimes a method in our madness!
around 300 outlets in total - not all outlets could participate, as some are quite small and do not have the space to carry inventory.
big thanks to them for their interest to help.
for those who haven’t received their flyers, please call 1800 738 2000 to leave your name, contact number and address.
the flyers don’t look like some spam mail from property agents, right?
but trying to scam the temasek foundation folks is not fine.
the call centre will pass on to the temasek foundation folks, who will evaluate and contact the affected folks in the next couple of weeks.
no promises, but i know the temasek foundation folks and others helping will do their best.
they will all be put it to good use for others.
- to help people learn more about the risk of silent covid pneumonia;.
- learn to use an oximeter;.
** what to do if you have a faulty oximeter?
just go to the temasek shophouse during operating hours, and bring along your oximeter with its box and other items in the box.
turned out her oximeter was in perfect working order.
it was just batteries not working.
happiness beamed from her big bright smile!
and the team cheered!
** what else to watch out for?
watch for news after national day.
more about these after national day.
that’s all, folks.
this is not newsworthy.
someone once said, whats wrong with collecting more money.
change collecting to earning is same same
am not surprised.
people give free things that you dont need, why no sell?
who starts the ball rolling n everything abt $$$ (gdp)?
temasek foundation money come from where?
i feel they should be contributing more $$$ to our government to spend on citizens rather than this marketing exercise.
so much of talk from empress dowager cixi.
ensuing in its path would be doom.
people give u free u don’t need then u collect and resell.
or better yet, just don’t collect.

2021 property tax was about $64.

$1 more a month.
what’s the annual value of your house
my property taxes over 5k per year.
who you have voted for first?
why pay extra tax to feed the filthy pap
no evidence to say anyone is against it.
so when increase rent and selling price of your property nobody publish on newspapers that they earn so much
technically it is $22 more and not $12
my parents 5room.
about 28% increased.
that makes $1.
80 more a month.
the whole family of 10 is going to starve to death.

bro, love yourself first.
the statistics was shared by health minister ong ye kung on monday evening (nov 15) at a virtual press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on covid.
mr ong and singapore's director of medical services kenneth mak both took the moderna shot after two jabs of the pfizer vaccine.
this means that of the remaining 15 per cent who are not vaccinated, 1 per cent of them are not living in singapore, 9 per cent are children below 12 and not eligible, and the remaining 5 per cent are eligible but chose not to be vaccinated, he added.
moh will provide both figures henceforth in our daily press release to give a fuller picture of the progress of our vaccination exercise," mr ong said.
which has higher risk ?
two pfizer + moderna booster seems to be the most effective combination.
i went with pfizer for the booster though as the earlier two shots of pfizer had no side effects.
 ditto for the booster.
 other than slight soreness in the arm for a day.
oyk was correct~  
i discussed with some people they all agree the thing is if u have p p or m m and have no side effect its no guarantee the third different shot wont give u problem?
wtf sino x 2 + pfizer = 95%.
pofma wanbao now!
how about unvax with zero jabs?
so mm is too strong no need boost?
better go with ppp or mmm.
why risk it with something your body might have an adverse reaction to?
same but with mild chest pain.
so i rather stick with pfizer.
plus i had my annual flu jab too.
you kpkb online these people will say sorry, change to 'all race welcome'?
the more they will make demands,
why u expect they will be peaceful when the number grow?
it is preference definitely .
however, nwadays there are certain groups of people who likes to stir preference into something esle.
these stir-ers are those who made us into what it is today.
same in parliament 
and u call yellow as urine.
its what inside your heart
like a marriage, people here mostly wld find someone of their own skin anw, not outside the circle .
i wouldn’t even think it’s racist.
minority of the minority
if a few people dont like you then is racist.
just making a comparison but you seem triggered.
as much as i wouldn’t want to rupture further nerves on your end, my point is made.
in ghey world is full of discrimination.
do we even have cathrynli simps in edmw?

that's why drink bubbletea to be fatter

edmw bbfa like van houten
we need more of such poor financial decision to support our property market.
and property prices.
so let them be.
if they dont heed your advice.
just be on the winning side.
yes terrible decision.
support rental market means supporting your property values
analyst will tell you to rent and invest surplus money that will give you better returns than buying property.
at current price point, i actually think renting is more worth it.
save the ultra big downpayment.
renting is cheaper than instalment + maintenance fee + maintenance of house.
forgo interest earned (assuming 1+2 from cpf).
8k in renovation and very good condition.
instalment for that house is $4k+, downpayment few hundred thousands.
they have the money to waste
many are in their early 30s and still single and they dont want to live with parents, so no choice but to rent an apartment.
1 room apartment easily cost 2k already
some people even make that amount in less than couple of hours in the stock market.
more than what u make a month
these guys are good for property market as it only increases demand for property.
when demand goes up and supply remain constant, its huat time.
if full serviced apartment then maybe its worth it.
ok some people dont think like some people.
mine went from $1,980 to $2,040, but annual rental yield increased by $2.
4k this year, so not so bad.
this is nothing compared to petrol tax.
my mum just handed me the property tax letter.
it makes it so much different
to me we could still afford the increased.
imagine those low income families , jobless sole bread winners and so on.
i am jobless and stress over this increase now.
why increase huh?
the valuation thingy is based on u rent out right
the point is if u are stuck in a dead end job with nowhere to go and only suffer such expenses increase, look at the mirror and ask why.
tks for pointing that out.
why should company give u increment if u do the same job year in year out?
taxi business is really bad.
i heard from my cousin who is taxi driver (60+ years old)  too.
some wait for economic to be better than drive taxi again.
occupier property tax is a huge reduction from actual.
look at the government tax collection.
now multiply by $22 increase.
and 100% are owner occupied.
that is more than $30 million of extra taxes collected.
how much this new fit/jazz thing?
freed is better
i feel this design is more catered towards women.
most top up and buy conti hatchback le
as per the post after.
lots more option with alternative.
if you are looking for a car, lots of choices.
then why a fit/jazz?
should be the new 1.
5l jazz right for that pricing.
anyways feel the design very jap/minimalist style.
is more expensive than previous gen
cos everybody driving honda vezel , no time for fit
cos the previous model looks nicer and more sporty.
the new fit looks guniang
waaaa aunt dino, you no reason suan me zuo mo?
i opined its not true cos i am neither tall handsome and rich.
2) bringing phone into toilet (it was not smartphone era; back then we were all using sms to text).
3) becoming distant; next to no intimacy.
4) saw her coming out of a guy's car at a very unusual location far beyond the normal drop off at our home.
i trusted my intuition, asked for divorce.
sorry, i dont hold the hands of attached guys  
thought i was replying a guy.
sorry, i should have framed my answers better!
like the movie the legend?
out of curiosity, when did all these start happening?
at least you're better off now without her.
ask you be my girlfriend dont want.
thank you sir, hope for the best for you too
i think it was a period when my career wasn't that promising, i was struggling.
it just went south suddenly.
yes, taller people have advantages.
but that does not mean all is lost.
read my posts here.
edit: by the way i know a 1.
the girls tell me he is stubborn and socially awkward.
height is not everything my friend.
wa this read still going wor.
for guys , height is of the most important trait honestly.
it is much far worst to be a ssfa than to be a bbfa.
thank you aunt dino
some girls dont even mind being taller than their men eg nicole kidman.
but that's rare.
its whats inside you that is more important.
deaths from break though infections the highest
the best is probably mix but there is risks too.
i call rubbish.
since they ventured to mix shots speak volumes of its efficacy.
should let us do reverse.
one pfizer dose then 2 sinovac.
i am still holding out vaccination.
0 x 0 x 0 = infinity.
you're hired to be thanos' intern.
i no longer trust all these alr
so after the 3rd jab, whats next?
fug this shiit, they all out to confuse you
wonder if enough data to make a statement yet.
please define the meaning of ‘effective’
when its gay and pink dot, its "racism" to say "i prefer chinese men" .
when its chinese girls, its "ok" to say "i prefer white men" cos "it's just a preference" .
that's why i have no qualms about this world going to ****ing ****.
so you admit it is from your heart
if so, isnt he discriminating his own kind?
the world is changing rapidly.
it always starts frm the us and slowly spreads thru the world.
im nt surprise if such videos/topics are created nt by the person himself and rather by syndicates of such agenda.
using western narrative for the 160th agenda.
when it comes to racism, its really not an apple to apple comparison between west and east.
you want doesnt mean other people want.
then when people dont want, cry.
isnt it know that the gay community is extremely racist?
more racist than the heterosexual community
whats wrong with having a preference?
if it disadvantage them, its call racism.
but when they have sexual fetishism for other race, they say preference.
spgs are not racist.
they, like the useless pap scum, open legs to everyone but locals.
article poorly written.
dunno what they pointing out.
just some dejected people trying to stir racisim.
