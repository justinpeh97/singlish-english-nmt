The case of an aesthetic doctor using veteran actress Fann Wong as an example in a lesson on face jobs has more or less come to a close.

Cant rmb whats the name of the bar restoran
what is worst than eating lunch alone daily with only caipng and 2 veg because im too poor and unpopular.
Can't rmb the exact details.
Can only roughly rmb the ah tiong server quite curt.
Enter the restaurant but he stood behind the counter.
Only my husband and I nia but he like not keen to bring menu or even greet.
I guess it was a huge contrast to the rest of the dining places in nz.
We had to asked for menu, then the food also not up to expectation.
Too sour, too oily and average.
Well, won't be returning.
Went because I was craving for something similar to dtf.
In new zealand?
Zhou's dumplings or something like that
do ppl really care about that?
must be Luis Suárez fault
I see “book” being mentioned.
So this was timed to sell his book?
 he didn’t want to reveal it when policed checked on him when he was 24 why now at 40?
yes i think so.
A man was charged on Wednesday (29 January).
This is old news or future news?
If get maximun 5 years jail, song bo
No lah, the better malls and places use a system whereby if you had checked in before and you try to scan again, it will be revealed as you had already done so based on the last 4 digits of your NRIC.
A fool is born every minute.
There’s too many things you don’t know it’s all about monitoring and controlling.
More will come .
the app also dont show the face to confirm the status with the face what.
how exactly do they catch these people?
They alr say tracetogether can be used for criminal activity
The reported bery blur.
More like 29 December 2021 (Wednesday)
Seems typo, shd be 29 December.
>If convicted of cheating by personation, Kiran may be jailed for five years, fined, or both.
serious men, liddat five years?
shd go rob banks ROI better
Should put the singh and that guy behind bar.
it's as good as attempted murder ah.
Why isn't the other JHK FT charged as well?
Both of them are bloody JHK FTs.
so is catched on the spot.
the staff so sharp can catch these ppl trying to sneak in with other ppl vaccination status.
In before driver road kill jail also 2 weeks nia.
Should’ve caned this jhk
isn’t it so much more convenient for the staff to just close an eye instead of the need to expose him and to file a police statement and stand as a witness if he claim trial.
so Ma fun for an offence that does not hurt anyone.
But I never check out one leh.
And I can check into the same mall again.
The Walking Deads are coming.

Out of all the South East Asian countries, only S'pore did not make any changes in the ranking @SnowFoxes @claypot_king
Wah we beat 50 countries
Well done, easy to read their ranking from the bottom of the list.
On August 1993, Singapore recorded its highest standing in the FIFA World Ranking at 73rd spot, thanks to its dream team featuring Lim Tong Hai.
Didn't Woody said we would be in world cup 2010?

Shane bao go to jail while this guy bought condo
Huh, should be young cow eat old grass rah!
Erm this unit is his snack house?
then Felicia how?
Looking at the youtube photo (not clicking!
more like wasting HIS youth for her.
He didnt know a pmet ceca leaked the virus back to our community?
Changi Business Park is ghosts or humans?
I already said most of those coming in are not the PMETs but the construction workers.
The new cluster ish by SIKA researcher.
LW try to bluff limbei.
Many in IT and Finance, no ?
The university research case from construction, marine and process ?
Go CBP plenty ?
Hello chennai business park is situated on mars is it?
Not considered part of sg is it?
That is a known secret.
What he referred was most of them work in those industries and lives in dormitories.
maybe it's way lesser than the construction, marine and process sectors.
can be 300k in construction, marine and process sectors.
and 100k in CBP.
So not wrong to say mostly from construction, marine and process sectors
This one very serious.
Should catch and fine him 9696.
Not most of them?
Trying to blend FT as FW ?
Conveniently left out the CECA PMETs?
He even forgot the recently reported NUS senior researcher, accountant, and bank employee, all of which are Ceca?
Lawrence, get real !
Even if they r MWs just arrived, weekends still see n piak FDWs, or go mustafa / tekka mkt.
They still can pass the virus even asymptomatic.
But they are stuck in dorms while ceca pmet having picnic at east coast?
notice the choice of words he used.
then whose great idea to over rely on india labour?
all the MIW cannot differentiate between FT and FW.
Knn no wonder sg govt from bad to worse.
LW should very happy about one thing today about the appointment.
I believe OYK would be able to handle all the press conference on his own.
He will not be receiving any taiji stroke from the guy sitting on the RH side of him during the future conference.
He will have more time to go over his script before he is appointed to address the Q&A.
The taiji master should be happy to be OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT and dun need to display his master kung fu any more.
LW, if really only construction workers, then why many LTVP, DP?
Why many SHN in hotels?
Help those that want to be helped should be okey le.
Sometimes kindness is a weakness.
Learnt it the hard way.
Repeated Reported thread for no head no tail.
MTF prease notice this thread!
Then when you are old, ppl will tell u what u just said.
This have nth to do with MTF, don't anyhow stir 
Huh got same thread ah?
I tell EDMW mods to combine.
what's the last part [wrong] gotta do w/ old age?
my idol Conor Mcgreggor said the same thing !
“if you disrespect the person's kindness and take it as a weakness you must pay tomorrow” MCGREGOR​.
When I say help those that wanted to be helped, I mean help those regardless of age mah.
I do no discriminate the old as well.
In fact, age should not be the consideration mah.
i would say, don't take kindness as my weakness.
one day you will become old nor.
when u are wrong den confess, easier to move on.
else become compulsive liar like some famous youtuber now.
are you also a Conor fan ?
Pap will help their old cronies.
So many fat and useless paper generals still get parachuted to jobs
Wa like that that means young also pointless, can go bedok reservoir liao.
What happened to make you feel this way?
Some AMDK study also claimed that some wuhan virus victims may also become IMH patients, like start to hear voices in their head?
That why the researchers believe that the virus may be able to do harm to our brains and nerves system.
Might as well say take over the human brain and body.
tot  they do autopsy on covid deceased but din find virus in the brain
if this is the start of movies' zombies, it's really scary.
Lol this is inspired
Virus always mutating and the first iteration was to bluff the researchers.

Very scare it makes raw blood and human flesh smells like food!
 Then i can sell impossible burgers using sai.

Parosmia is dysfunctional smell detection characterized by the inability of the brain to correctly identify an odor's "natural" smell.
Instead, the natural odor is usually transformed into an unpleasant aroma, typically a "'burned,' 'rotting,' 'fecal,' or 'chemical' smell".
Next time chiobu fart will really smell like perfume
It the smell of the waygu beef lungs.
Many cells uplorried in the lungs due to wuhan.

In her case she made use of IDA/SG credibility to mask her fake degree in amurica, which I belv she's there now.

You are just one of my entertainment, correct.
But you boring la.
give PR like toilet paper, i believe .

There is nothing wrong with using a stepping stone tho.

If gov discriminated the unvax, the unvax should discriminate the VDS and avoid these entries (even if vaccinated).
"about marriage, which, by the way, still won’t be happening any time soon for him and Felicia.
“A lot of couples in Singapore get married very quickly, but getting to know each other is a lifelong process, and today’s ‘fast food culture’ shouldn’t apply to marriage or it’ll be very unstable,” he mused.
Ald 6 years liao where got fast food?
Really can talk his way out.
need wait until 12 years then safer meh!
So small how to piak Felicia from kitchen to balcony
should be good business
I hope they do one in the north.
Jurong East got 2 ****ing side by side.
Maybe get featured in Stranger Things ad.
Can open in North Point City.
The crowd there quite good.
if open in yishun i think the people might become more atas.
proud of our lions achievement
Myanmar and Pinoys now higher than Singapore.
50th best team in the world ok.
if the rankings were upside down that is.
Vietnamese netizens often regard SEA as the 'bottom' area of the football world.
Really is cmi.
So the world cup dream still on?
Or continue dreaming lol
same same but different   
iceland also not all full time
same as newspaper?
They regard SEA as the "bottom", but they themselves treat the suzuki cup so seriously and they celebrate their victory parade like as if the SEA tournament is the "top" area of the football world 
Yah indeed we a bunch of hypocrites mah 
I do remember a bit of Dollah Kassim, Rajagopal, Quah Kim Song but don't have a lasting memory so I can't tell who is the greatest Singaporean footballer.
Most old timers would say Dollah or Quah.
But the 2 I have seen that are great are.
Special mentions to Baikakki and Subramani whom I referred whilst they were young teenagers.
Both are very disciplined.
Another good player was Nazri Nasir.
But it's between Fandi and Sundram.
I would say Sundram is probably by a small margin the better player.
Skill wise and natural ability.
But take nothing away from Fandi.
he was truly very disciplined and strove to improve himself and thus had a longer and more successful career than Sundram.
Unlike many players from his era or before that, most after reaching the local heights - Malaysia Cup and representing Singapore would kind of relax a bit but not Fandi.
What he lacked in skill, he strove to improve by self training and hard work.
Sundram had a bit of a party animal in him.
So greatest that I have seen would have to go to Fandi but best would be Sundram.
There's a slight difference between the 2 accolades.
Once upon a time, the football league in sinkieland is semi pro one and sinkieland together with thailand and maybe malaysia were the best team in the region.
Everything went downhill when they turn the league into a pro one.
And btw, jin xia suay that both the media and football are ranked 160 in the world
Wow this is such a solid analysis
Viet should have some fatigue legs.
They participating in Suzuki Cup, Asia Cup, World Cup Qual, so they should choose which tournament they want to prioritise.
As for SG Lions, they only have Suzuki Cup to focus on without much distraction
160th best team —> this sentence  sounds weird
not bad not bad, we are in the top 160
Not bad, same as out press freedom ranking.
can change title to 50th worst team?
Then just send them to US.
Sinkie land also turn refugees away how come US never outcry.
They dont get in , so nothing to worry about here.
Because MY flip prata, they kpkb nobody help and offer their help as most are muslim, then now want to send them back bcos cannot afford to have them ard or they have learned the hard way why Myanmar don’t want them in the first place
show off their condos .
and landed properties on social media?
isnt thats what social media is for?
bragging & humblebragging
U pcc and cum on their face when have opportunity and then run away
true, but they could be more subtle about it.
You will earn their respect if you show off your condom and mistress on the social media.
wow thanks for IGing.
show off my hdb back.
they may think they're being "subtle" enough to do it online.
if not subtle is do it IRL.
diff ppl diff.
u cant control what they do but u can control yrself.
mute, ignore, unfriend, unfollow - so many choices at yr disposal.
You can try to doxx them by DM them their address down to the unit number.
Remember watching some documentary couple years back about how some stalkers managed to dig the address of some celebs down to the unit they are staying in and their daily schedules by just analysing the small details in the photos they posted on their social media.
just saying, don't get so worked up lol.
she super famous in tiktok nao.
every1 using her voice to make beedio.
Not that hard to do actually.
Just need some patience.
Iirc, mediacock Talking Point ever got a couple of Bloggers, I repeat, Bloggers who managed to CSI where the host is living down to his unit number from studying his social media posts.
I still remembered how his jaws dropped when the Bloggers handed him the "search results".
You can always unfriend them if chiu dun like them posting on social media
they happy jiu hao
Not everyone knows the art of humble bragging.
*flicks hair back*
It is normal for humans to flaunt their wealth ma.
And we are still waiting for vaccine because WHO said so
that day i saw one FT never wear mask.
I wanted to go say him but I thought about it, what if next time he beat me up since I stay in the same area.
In the end, i just diam diam walk away
Dun talk back to ur master
No, I'll NPNT in edmw instead.
if FT, got crowd, I'll chide .
but some pple I say, and it's really they forget and U-turn back home.

Kenna posted on tik tok FB edmw.
duno admin will help chiu leemove thread or notch, maybe  at best help chiu mosaic face
Maybe can ask them if they mask is hard to breathe or ill-fitting and give them a mask for them to try instead.
 Usually most will paiseh n pull up their mask.
If they accept good no harm?
if bigger size than me, of course better for me to be hum n ignore pretend no see walk away.
if lower grass ses like FW, can act moral high horse and kan
Y u scared he beat u up, not scared he pass virus to u if u walk up to him?
After all he is maskless?
Isnt that the reason u want him to wear mask in the first place?
Cos u scared he spreading virus right?
Was at gp clinic to see doctor.
Got a group of 3 foreign looking patients pull down mask to chit chat.
They also had the MOH form from doctor to do swab test at sash clinic, potential infected cases.
The clinic assistant did not force them to wear mask so nothing i could do.
Need effort and I can’t be bothered.
no vigilante actions preash.
if u kenna beat, u may be left on your own to file magistrates report, pay for medical checkups etc.
if kenna film getting the shiat beaten out of u, ppl will laugh at u for being weak.
other ppl die is not my problem.
u so eat full nothing to do?
Last month i was on the mrt towards boon lay and halfway one skinny ah bang boarded and he sat opposite of me (those 2 seater seat).
Though he has a mask but the mask was pull down to his chin leaving his mouth and nose expose and there a guy sitting beside him but was busy texting and listening to music.
Next the guy alighted and a elderly boarded and sat beside him and also never caution him.
When i alight at boon lay, he still on the train with his face expose.
Since no one bother to, i mind my own biz, dun want later like the mrt incident where the bui bui kana ko by the muay thai ah bang

Kids will probably miss the experience of running about checking all the stations.
seoul gardan getting moar and moar ex leh
Pm elect now can all bird talk.
CECApura is fked
i think at this juncture, no body cares about MIW's word play.
they think sinkies are idiots anyway
Maybe start giving them pr so they can stay here and want to stay here to work
Categorically if he wrong placed his emphasis and dealt with the problems incorrectly, we will all be in trouble.
Fearmongering with words like impacted construction (BTO) etc.
But who open the flood gate without strict border control?
Virus flew in itself at Changi isit?
I'm not concerned with those India indians dorm workers.
They are confined to work sites and dorm.
It's those disgusting SP and EP Ceca who mix in our community who will spread their disgusting diseases to us.
they always mention the low ses workers but dun dare to stop the rameshes frm entering.
If they ended up fixing the wrong problem in dormitories than in hotels, we will end up with more Covid.
Melville Park, Mandarin Gardens are dorms meh?
wat is he talking abt
He mentioned that India Indian restrictions will impact BTO and construction.
These areas should also be designated as dorms asap already.
they dare not talked abt high ses ceca
Conveniently he left out ceca again.
Like that can be fm?
need to take pic of my birdy.
Mistake to be overly reliant on any particular  source for labour.
Covid-19 has exposed several weaknesses in our ways of doing things.
Meaning we need them back as soon as possible?
He is trying to do a Zhuge Liang stunt trying to confuse people.
Those ceca coming in are pmet, not construction workers.
Air tickets cost a bomb nowadays, those construction workers won't afford.
Don't have Indian also have bangla, myanmar and other construction workers.
Many india indians also stay along all the condos at ECP
Those in dorms are Bangladeshi not CECAs.
 moi go bedok reservoir see got long queue.
too sianz to wait to jump so come back home and muddy alone instead.
But my CPF got in no out….

Still around lah.
just sticking to my usual chit chat threads.
so much anger and negativity around.
more so than usual.
 cut down on my trolling lo.
@runforyourlife , u suddenly talk like this i very worry, see open a bit hor, n go listen to your wu yue tian to destress loh
Was expecting a nonsense karma thread, but the content turn out ok, fostering a good culture is definitely the way to go 
yup, but if some don't deserve the help(abusing your kindness, never appreciate, scold you back instead) then let them be.
After I make her come then she will turn around and make me come
tell it to Calvin "Car Chng" Cheng
I like the new EDMW moderators, very matured and with rational thinking, not like those in the past with lotsof ginna pis.
i am already old and weak.
Probably a good respite from oyk and ceca thread
I think my NS changed me a lot too.
My outlook and thinking before and after NS very different.
After ns, some of the observations from edmw seems to validate my experience bah.
Some individuals are notoriously cunning and some superiors are fking cb.
Thish ish the narratives of the entitled old unreasonable people.
If you find a way to not get old, let me know  
Nothing wrong with getting old.
Sho long as i ish not entitled and unreasonable.
And use quotes rike the above to justify old me being entitled and unreasonable.
Confusion philisophy teach this.
But reality teach us the opposite is true.
Just saw at dome 3 under vpremium.
They really think sinkies are carrot head ?
viet bu is from 3rd world kampung country.
Ever heard the concept supply and demand?
You from which era?
The chio ones already 300/1/1 some time ago.
U think your money cow cart wheel ar?
wah ,if  doing grabfood have to run 60-70 trips to fuxk this sh1t one time
They are thinking sinkies pay are like ceca .
20k per mth where in reality mostly is 2k to 3k per mth.
His name got 80 so he think is $80 lor.
si ginna ghost back stardee mai cum dis type forums
 really leegret never whack when studying that time.
Wanted to go with first paycheck.
Now 2 years still birgin  .
Cheekon prices also sky high 
Add 1 more zero to what some sinkies spend on VNB at siam tius.
Means they up-price liao?
Previously was around 260~270
TS so innocent to think sinkies won't accept that offer  
If u nid to ask this, ur in the wrong thread my friend
What ts expect.
Is like hdb de ma.
Low demand will cheaper if high demand sibeh sexpensive de ler later cum out the news say which okt is arrested or burst liao then the price conberm will go up like hdb.
Gov cum out news say few vendor cannot tahan then hdb price pew pew up liao.
Just blame ownself too poor to get it
moi nono that ish why moi ask
Even $2-3k once awhile also can afford some luxuries.
But sky high prices mostly aim at those high earners or those who do pian one lor.
Even locals $1k+ a shot rich ppl don't mind pay.
Why do you need to deal with them ?
TS, have it ever occur to you why you wasting your own time on other people life ?
That is what I am doing now.
But most who own a condo will not show off their kitchen becos it is fuсking small, smaller than any HDB flat.
Oh no ts salty again
Straits times can use that heading for their future reporting :.
“ST Retains Top 160th Ranking in Press Freedom Index”
If he didn't score own goals, would we have been higher?
Why are those jokers at FAS still being paid for failures?
It's been years.
fwah the ranking 
Jin satki mens FAS!
Actually this is an anomaly.
 North Korea's rank is low because they haven't been playing much and withdrew from the WC Qualifiers even.
A tournament they have qualified twice for and came close to reaching a number of times too.
They always were a reasonably good football team in the Asian context.
A shade below South Korea , Iran, Japan and now of course the Aussies.
But their standard always around the reasonably good Middle Eastern teams like the Saudis or Iraqis.
And when they have better players or on their day they can beat Japan or Korea.
Youth level also they were good.
But it remains to be seen if they can recover quickly from this self-imposed ban.
If not may take a few more years to reach Asia's top 10 or even higher.
Wah same as state media.
Sama-sama as our media
Lion's ranking same as SPH ranking  
This is a question of what could have been.
Nobody exactly know the definite answer to it
Where u get all these stats and figures 
How to slip further if 160 is the last country?
Coincidence that media and football are both 160?
Must be oppositions fault for fielding a bad khan.
Not meant to hv this sport.
No mixed players .
cui means cui !
Vietnam will focus on Suzuki Cup lah.
Vietnam world cup hopes.
is close to 0% because they are in a group where at least 4 teams is better than Vietnam.
I bet my kkj they would not even finish 4tg in their group.
As for Asia cup, they already qualified for the 2023 final tournament lah n 2023 is still at least a year plus ah.
Spore can only thrive in M league.
Even Got mixed player would not help.
U all remember this player Anders Aplin?
Lion would not even smell the top half of the m league table post 2017.
nothing,, i scared they take umbrage 
Better report to police.
Let police do their job.
Do not try to act like police.
remb chuir place in the hierarchy be4 doing anything stupid.
foreign gamen > miw > elites > ceca > sovereign > Ftrash > FW > cats and snails > low ses sinkies
We don't have a badge.
Furthermore we will get scolded.
Before he beat u, u give a punch to his nose first.
make sure u break his nose bridge and fall to the ground.
he is yours to take.
Not paid why rat on others.
Doing the gestapos work for free.
Unless got one app credit $500 every report
U did the right thing.
Wait he tulan beat u up like the guy in the mrt.
Mayb he wearing invisible mask that only the smart can see, low ses sinkie sure can't see
I won't say anything but will distance myself from the person like he/she's kind of disease
Just keep silent, diam diam stand one side.
Don’t kpo go say the FT or offer them mask.
There was once i offered a FT from south asia a brand new mask  but said that is dirty asked me to buy a new one  ended up i paid $30+ for a brand new box  of masks for the FT.
Must do risk assessment first.
If you say them, following are the possible outcomes:.
They don't comply, scold you instead.
They don't comply, saying that they were brisk-walking, and may even report you for being racist or xenophobic.
They don't comply, and sneeze/cough/spit into your face.
They don't comply, and beat you up.
They don't comply, did any of the above mentioned things to you, and fellow Sinkies don't come to your aid and support, instead pwn you further.
Dont bother, you not SDA
I see these people everyday leh, no mask or mask on chin.
But I don't dare to go lecture them, later Kena called racist 
they wear or dont wear its none of our business they are adult if they get the covid then so be it just protect yourself wearing mask u live longer.
You’ll be arrested for racism.
Even if you’re the same race
I scared they ask me “where is your badge?
I will not go forward to tell them, and quickly walk away.
think about it.
u wear mask is to protect others, not urself.
so they don't wear mask u are in danger, not them.
what for I risk myself to argue with those irresponsible ppl.
is it very noisy?
My condo unit just beside lift, convenient and not noisy
Surely not HP right
condo one maybe made in japan.
  HDB made from china one, the cheapest type.
 very noisy one.
Generally noise not from lift itself.
It's the ppl using it.
Sometimes people come out will talk loudly one
Technically if the lifts have loud "ding!
" Sound every single time it opens/closes the door or reaches a floor.
maybe it can be irritating
Condo got security guard?
High SES owner.
If yr door gd won’t hear.
But try not to pick unit near or worse facing lift.
my main door is the lift unit.
Good luck to you TS.
HDB, with all the low ses and aliens, you can expect it to be very noisy.
At night can hear the lift movement.
lift not noisy.
is the si ginna, neighbours like to gather near lift lobby play and talk loudly.
sometimes nearby sch students will gather there and do some actions.
unit besides lifts usually comes with central bin.
u get 2 headaches
Mine is old Hdb lift upgrading so there’s one lift to share among 4 houses for every level.
There’s DingDong but normally cant hear much.
Midnight if v quiet can hear the mechanical thud of the lift when my ear is near the wall.
New HDB may be noisier bcos of thinner walls.
Depends on your tolerance and sensitivity.
My old place had a lift added after upgrading, my new place faces the lift almost directly.
In both cases,  i usually do not notice the lifts except when some rhino or bunch of monkey comes running out of it 
Notch really an issue to moi.
Benefits more than bad ones.
Point block sibei song.
10 steps and chiu are at lift.
In my situation, each floor has 2 units.
The lift is about 4 steps away from my front door.
I don’t even notice it.
Door always close who walk pass also don’t know right?
Autumn is near good luck to them
wat at the expense of your own people's well being!
A sign of things to come, trading material for well-being
when the people drop one by one due to covid, good luck to the economy and tourism.
Don't worry, even sinkie experts have said it's like flu
If you take care of your health and maintain a healthy weight with adequate exercise, there is no way you are dying to covid or even having symptoms.
Personal responsibility > lockdowns
But the thing is if they don't drop dead one after another then you know you've been reading fake news, your gov will flip flop their story
personally if you ignore your well being there are plenty of activities that have huge payoffs, like being a drug mule, or providing sexual services to HIV positive people.
Mask mandates and lockdowns may be doing more harm than good.
I'm supporting Mr DeSantis stance on the Covid 19 situation all the way (even though I'm Singaporean).
He's an ivy league scholar, so I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
Very well said… people seem to have “outsourced” personal responsibility of their health over to lockdowns and vaccines and their government, and worse, they want everyone else to do the same
I wouldnt go so far to say no symptoms, but I believe it will be relatively mild.
Just take care of your health and weight.
Then you are practically invincible to covid or any other flu.
Its really that simple.
If you are so busy that you dont even have time to exercise(which i believe is just an excuse), then you have to watch what you eat.
You gain weight when you consume more calories than you burn.
If you dont exercise, simply eat lesser.
Maintaining a healthy weight is really the key to longevity.
Wanting more lockdowns and vaccines is just ridiculous.
Millions of people are gonna be pushed into poverty and suicide.
Well then too bad for them.
You dont wanna take care of your own health.
It will be even more worse if you dont take the vaccine.
We can debate about the effectiveness and purpose of vaccines all we want, but it has shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and even death.
So if you are a FAT ASS and you do not even attempt to lose into a healthy weight, and still don't take the vaccine, then good ****ing luck to you.
Lol say that in US you will kena SJW'ed for Fat shaming.
But those jobs have little impact to our local industries.
"Many of the new arrivals from India work in the construction, marine and process sectors and live in the dormitories".

Me and my friend invested 2xxk into a company in aug 2019.
We did the shares transfer and director inclusion via corp sec.
The managing director refuse to hand over the bank signatory even after we have added in directorship.
Abruptly in oct 2019, our share holding and directorship was removed from acra by himself holding on to the corp pass, without our knowledge and approval.
The company stopped operations.
In dec 2919, the managing director of the company called me to assist in a loan repayment citing I am a director in the company.
I issued a cheque to hong leong finance, but the payment is rejected.
At thus point, our names had been removed from acra and the MD did not informed us.
Thru out the CB period, the MD just said that due to covid operations had stopped.
Until july 2020, we realised our shareholdings and directionship had been changed without our knowledge.
We tried to approach the MD, but he is not contactable.
Does any of this sounds like a cheating case.
Any law enforcement personnel or lawyer care to comment?
just call police.
Police bochap, say civil case.
No Shareholders agreement?
Funny story btw, you cannot close a company off without all directors signing, same with bank account
The company is not closed down but ceased operations.
The MD refused to hand over signatory after we were added in as director.
Our agreement is that once the company is doing well, we will sell back the shares to him.
What is Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT)?
The phrase “Criminal Breach of Trust” (CBT) may sound complicated, but let us break it down for you.
CBT usually involves a misuse of funds or property, and covers a wide range of activities.
Remember the City Harvest Church corruption scandal?
It was all over the news when the 6 church leaders misused more than $50 million of the church’s funds to further the pop music career of Pastor Kong Hee’s wife.
This misuse of funds that were entrusted to them by churchgoers is a classic example of CBT.
Other cases of CBT may include dishonestly pawning off a necklace you borrowed from your friend.
Elements of criminal breach of trust.
According to section 405 of the Penal Code, CBT is committed when a person who is entrusted with property, or is given control over property, dishonestly:.
Misappropriates that property;.
Converts that property for his own use;.
Uses/disposes that property in violation of a law or contract; or.
Deliberately allows another person to do any of the above.
Entrustment: For CBT to be committed, a person must be either entrusted with the property, or have control over the property.
Entrustment is easily found in cases where a professional receives property.
For example, bankers in charge of transferring money to another account, or admin staff who are put in charge of keeping signed cheques, are people who have been entrusted with property.
Dishonesty: The person must have also acted dishonestly.
This means that they must have had the intention to cause someone (such as themselves) to wrongfully receive a benefit, or to wrongfully cause a loss to the victim.
Who is the Corp sect
The corp sec is in yishun and did not have any knowledge of the MD transfering back the sharea to himself.
He has to correct it.
After the company ceased operations (not closed down).
The MD transferred back the shares to us.
We have file a complaint to acra since july 2020 and they have yet to revert back to us.
Yes buddy, lawyer say got case, police say no case.
Get caught dunno how to proceed.
Lawyer fee 40 plus k.
Sekali come out nothing, even more tng kor
What damages you looking for?
I understand bro.
Actually i am trying to gather some advice from probably ex agency officers to see what type of evidence is needed to prove my case stronger.
We will restrict ourselves to within the state court court limit.
Otherwise high court will cost more.
No, as in the 'cheating' what loss was there to you?
Courts can only recover, not enrich.
how much will u tip each of them ?
one from Sim one from Ri and how much.
No tips to them at all
Same ranking as our newspaper.

160 means we better than 50 other countries leh.
Time for pay raise and bonus for FAS!
Not noisy for me.
maybe used to it liao.
Lift normally won't notice much and yeah, it's the people who make a lot of noise.
People using the lift.
when they come out or wait for lift, some will laugh or talk very loudly.
Some lifts will have sound i.
e pi pi sound, opening or closing.
Some lifts even worse, will have voices to tell ppl lift opening or closing too.
In some situations, ppl who pressed the emergency button mistakenly will affect the units nearby as well.
Lifts & lift users can generate a lot of noises if u ask me
Commenter asks Lawrence Wong if he made 'lousy school' comment in Parliament.
In case you wanted to know.
sounds like his voice
22, Wong uploaded a short video of himself discussing jobs, concerns over foreign competition and unfair practices at work, and Singapore's necessity of being an open economy, despite its downsides.
In a perfect microcosm of the Parliament debate, (Dex) Wong didn't respond to any of the points that (Lawrence) Wong made, and instead asked him whether or not he made those comments about Leong.
then who ah pls own up 
Got ghost there
He never comment to say its wrong to say that?
At least he got guts to answer to the question.
Mothership must be fixed!
who siah who siah.
Not sure about others but for me it did sound like it came from VB
Ah gui deserves a beer for sharing this
Wow Lawrence wong for PM!
Self destruct liao, every man for himself
Then reveal who is the one.
He and VB definitely know.
Can believe him or not?
How can anyone prove otherwise?
Given that he can't answer yes he did, or not answer at all; which will just imply guilt.
Then who is the one who said that?
Thought their policy is don't cover up and come out to admit?
something else better
Not even a full song….
Make me buay song

NSF is now how much?
Pian almost always make more than legal jobs one.
Only exception if you are the boss and can scale up your biz like Grab or Secretlab CEO.
You must be naive if you think ktv girls dont sleep around for money, they do too.
I think they market themselves as premium.
So their marketing strategy is target rich people.
So is very niche market and demand can be smaller.
An average Vietnamese salary in hcmc is only $500-600.

Thats why vietbus like to come here .

Even average one charging 150/1/1 .
they can easily earn $30k a month.
(excluding 5 day period).

Announce at Noon so early means "good" news.
also nowadays if it is good news he will announce, bad news he will leave it to 4G.
so I am guessing he gonna ease restrictions.
NO MORE NEED TO TEST*.
BORDERS FULLY OPENED*.
EVERYONE CAN DINE OUT*.
TRACETOGETHER CAN THROW AWAY*.
HEALTHY NO NEED TO WEAR MASK.
*the above are my guess and are not actual announcements of our beloved PM Lee​
Chiong supermarket for groceries tomorrow
My fellow Singaporeans?
maybe no need to wear masks liao
Cb la ease restrictions at this stage.
We sure we ready?
i think he buay soong international media keep attacking Singapore!

watch sinkes do the opposite!
together we can overcome this difficult time.
All Covid restrictions removed
if not he wont personally announce
Covid has ended.
MY FELLOW EDMW BBFAS!
My fellow Singaporeans .
u invested 2xxk and didnt took part in day to day ops of the business and to rectify internal control issues.
and now u want 250k back ah
Yes,  we are seeking to recover part of our investment.
Its not we are not involved.
We were kept out of the operations.
M&AA & citing the lack of Board/Director resolutions probably your best chance right now.
Basically the MD is screwed if m&aa is crafted well.
Whatever will be, will be.
We have invested more than quarter mil.
Seeking to recover quarter mil b4 lawyer fees.
After lawyer fee, we could only recover maybe 200k ideally
Easy for us to say.
Money not entirely mine
SG not loser have to pay your lawyer fees meh?
So you want court to order he buy you all out ie get back investment?
Judge will send for arbitration.
Tq buddy will look at this route
Maybe the cheater higher ses than you that's why the police and lawyer don't agree on assessment of case
this kind only can civil lawsuit.
biz issues our law dun really care.
Thanks for the advice.
The MD came to see me with a 3 yrs P.
From Singapore Semicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) , citing it's a 3 mil business and he is short of capital.
I called on a friend to help him.
We gave the company 2xxk for 51% of his comapny share agreeing to return 31% back to him once his ops stabilised.
After transfer the shares and money, he refused to transfer signatory of bank accout.
He just mysteriously stopped operation and trf our share holding and directorship.
And became uncontactable.
Does it sound like we have a case against him?
Investment fail and chiu want get back ur money plus profit.
But proving expensive
Investment was over quarter mil, seeking to recover 200k
Go find lawyer leh, its a civil lawsuit only.
Very hard to say people fraued you in investing in company one.

China says 'Uyghur tribunal' that found Xi responsible for 'genocide' is a farce.
LONDON: The Chinese embassy in London said an unofficial tribunal of lawyers that accused Beijing of genocide against the Uyghurs was nothing more than a political tool of China's enemies, who were spreading lies.
The unofficial tribunal of lawyers and campaigners said on Thursday (Dec 9) that Chinese President Xi Jinping bore primary responsibility for what it said was genocide, crimes against humanity and torture of Uyghurs and Kazakhs in Xinjiang.
An embassy spokesman said it was "nothing but a political tool used by a few anti-China and separatist elements to deceive and mislead the public".
"Anyone with conscience and reason will not be deceived or fooled," the spokesman said.
WHAT THE "TRIBUNAL" SAID.
The tribunal, which is headed by British lawyer Geoffrey Nice, has no powers of sanction or enforcement.
"The People's Republic of China (PRC) has committed genocide, crimes against humanity and torture against Uyghur, Kazakh and other ethnic minority citizens in the north-west region of China known as Xinjiang," the British-based Uyghur Tribunal said on Thursday.
"The Tribunal is satisfied that President Xi Jinping .
and other very senior officials in the PRC and CCP (Chinese Communist Party) bear primary responsibility for acts that have occurred in Xinjiang.
The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), which represents the interests of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang and around the world, asked Nice in 2020 to set up an independent tribunal to investigate accusations of abuse in Xinjiang.
Some foreign lawmakers and parliaments, as well as the US secretaries of state in both the Biden and Trump administrations, have labelled the treatment of Uyghurs as genocide.
But China vehemently denies that.
In a statement on Thursday, its foreign ministry dismissed the WUC as a separatist organisation under the control and funding of anti-China forces in the United States and the West.
"This so-called court has no legal credentials nor any credibility," a ministry spokesperson said, describing the testimony given as false and the final judgment as a "political farce performed by a few clowns".
"Lies cannot conceal the truth, cannot deceive the international community nor stop the historic course of .
Xinjiang's stability, development and prosperity," the ministry spokesperson said of the Uyghur tribunal.
UN experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in Xinjiang.
China initially denied the camps existed but later said they were vocational centres and designed to combat extremism.
In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had "graduated".
The Munich-based WUC welcomed the tribunal's judgment.

3k x 22days (8days relax do nothing sleep) should be 60k or one year of median sinkie salary or 10 years of vn average pay.
Of course agent and rental need to pay but if she work hard enough.
Six months is more than enough to no need work for rest of life in vn
no wonder they cause the covid cluster
That's why they are willing to brave the shame and dangers to work here to earn quick bucks.
You will be surprised just how little they earned back home, unless they engaged in some illegal stuff.
Definitely there are some out there, need open and see

Yup, by right right right, corp sec needs to meet up all parties to sign in his/her presence and he/she will endorse.
But most cases, ppl just pass that document around for the next person to sign.
Yes, 200k is another issue.
But step by step first lo, have to prove this is unlawful then use the verdict to wack the bugger.
If he declares bankrupt, then slowly get money back if the court rules in the favour
u invest 2xxk but dont want spend 1k to talk to a lawyer?
Bankrupt can forget about claiming money liao
TS chiu need to consult a lawyer not on EDMW.
We have spent more than that to talk to lawyer.
Apparently according to district judge, he declated bankrupt in august 2020.
But he still has private property under his name and bankrupt registry doesnt have his name.
What does that mean?
you read the last financial report and went through lawyer to read the company article or not .
really sound like buying vegetable.
Just buy all ACRA filings 1st so at least you know something.
I have to admit there is an oversight there.
Poh mata + call lawyer for advice.
$200k not small amount 
Mata say no criminality.
Acra no response*
shareholders have no right to look at the accounts, and are you sure that you bought ordinary shares.
He could even done everything legally.
edmw have Queens lawyer.
please keep paging for this legend to appear.
My buddy was the share holder and i was appointed director.
There was no accounts.
We push him to do it after injection of funds but he never did.
the transfer of shares part is false declaration i believe.
basically all this efiling.
they simplify and let the person doing transaction self declare he have all the consent etc.
but still wont get your money back.
its hard to get back if he indeed use the money for company operations.
unless he use the money to pay himself etc.
means not acting in the best interest of the company liao.
get back money is hard.
all the fees and time spent.
can get back half also dont know
it will be a dragging war for years to hunt down this cheater.
worth your time and money or not?
just social media publish his face and company big big and xia suay him.
call newspaper, pick up headline, let his supplier/clients know.
means they not going to jab kids for this age group?
They are recommending to not vaccinate the healthy teenagers, and only vaccinate those with underlying conditions.
Quoting from the article:.
"The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation did advise widening the existing vaccine programme to include an extra 200,000 teenagers with specific underlying conditions.
Jab Liao trigger underlying condition how
OYK going to pofma these scientists?
think so far UK has been consistent and never advocated vaccine for young people
Means they are not going to jab their own kids.
Don’t worry according to MTF everyone has underlying conditions so all will be eligible for jabs under these UK guidelines
This guy should be taught a lesson.
But young girls nowadays can also be irrationally "brave", can meet him alone in his house and went inside his bedroom.

He will just remain silent on the matter.
He openly say hes not the one means, its confirm vivi
the RI comment, the tone of that sentence totally different from lousy school comment.
Got @s-ghost in parleement?
He chew iron grow big one ah?
no ah gui confirm not there
Q: Sir, did you make the "lousy school" comment?
A: No, i can assure you I did not say the "lousy school" comment.
I said in full "he must be from a lousy school".
A: Please don't misquote me and quote me out of context.
satki riaos can walk up straight
Obviously it was Vivi right?
He already apologised for it what.

too bad got coward dare say but don't dare admit, so he got implicated.
So did he or not made the comment.
We are talking about integrity issue here.
Or it was someone else voice.
The "lousy school" comment didnt sound like it was from Vivian.
 I thought it sounded like LW.
 But I am obviously not correct since LW came out and clarified that it was not him.

Like that can just pay a bit more can get JP liao.
Song song gao jurong
chop carrot until like that
i google it showed Garden by the Bay dome, so is it go there and find?
Sinkies still pay for it thats why they come and covid makes prices become black market as supply so low but high demand.
You may think why ppl so carrothead but to others $300 is just small change like a price of a meal to normal ppl.

The snake was lucky not to have been laped and killed.
When he talk to me guai lan.
Then he ask me what my order I tell him whopper.
Saw him walk into the kitchen then he ask a staff to pass me my burger without calling my number.
What will happen if I eat the burger 
Open burger , look through it to see whether spit & mucus in it.
If tomorrow you get diarrhea, report SFA & BK HQ
I check already nothing.
Maybe he accidentally drop the bun then pat dust off the bun 
If I were you,  i won't even eat it now if its free.

He has only himself to blame for not studying hard in school.
This is his karma.
I think it's within Dhoby MRT.
Just the other side (near Singapore shopping centre) which people dont usually go.
that's another xchange.
so to come to think of it, I've never been to orchard xchange nor heard of it before.
Where is this place even located?
How did SMRT account for the cost of construction?
Unless it is subsidised by tax payers and SMRT does not care whether they collect rent or not.
Was popular before plaza sing extension siphoned away all the commuters.
And if tenants are comparing with ion, maybe they should also compare the amount of rent they're paying .
Edit my bad I tot the dhoby ghaut one
thanks to ms saw
nvm , completely different place lols
Article mentioned next to Ion?
I thought is Wheelock/ wisma?
What is this shiat place?
Why they even choose to rent that space?
SMRT is quite a shitty retail landlord, it's next to ION but not even visible.
It was Forever21 before them iirc, all cleared out and partitioned.
I only realised that place existed when I was shopping the T2 Tea, suddenly got one opening that leads to that god forsaken ground.
Is it because of the way the escalator entry is ?
Somehow the mrt exit level and basement seems to be most popular.
The level between ground floor and mrt exit seems like accidentally built.
This is the taichi master CEO's legacy.
Supposed to become the main money generating arm of SMRT during the rail maintenance negligence years.
SMRT should lease out or sell off the retail assets to a bigger mall player.
since the beginning, never once walk past to even ssrr of what are the stuffs they sell there .
usually would just go to the intended mall, that's it 
All I can ask them is, who did they vote for?
There are TJ Pagar Xchange, Raffles Xchange, Dhoby Gauht Xchange and Orchard Xchange.
But business damn jialat.
SMRT normally will lease the shop to Event Organiser like Ideal Connection, Hemus and Event Business Management.
Then they will mark out and lease out the unit.
Similar to what we saw at Serangoon Interchange, Hougang Interchange, Ang Mo Kio Interchange and etc.
Mostly lease to Middle Man business, mark up the rent then lease out again.
So SMRT will get the rental no matter if the unit is occupied or vacant.
Then as for Event Organisers, if cannot find long term like Malay Kueh, handphone shop, Prepack food to lease the shop, they will rent weekly to Insurance, Bank, Electricity company to do "roadshow" for them to tout customers charging them $350 - $650 per day for a week.
As expected an ex army general CEO, running businesses to the ground.
Why singapore business naming all.
Like to play with X think very cool?
It’s very 90s loh!
That place is decent traffic since it's on the way to Cathay, last time went there to eat, got free flow ice cream.
woo ricebox was good.
but now closed liao.
The concept was great actually, using leftover space beside the MRT for retail.
But the wayfinding is ****, so hard to go in and out, and the interior is so dull and dated.
Sometimes they dont even have aircon in the deeper shops.
Total failure la.
Too stingy to find a retail expert to look at it first so thats what u pay lor.
Because they're made by Gen X.

Original price was 50+.
Mine lasted for 12yrs and going strong.
But it's not a full wallet.
More like cardholder but it has enough space and size to put cash.
Bought a new piece recently cos this model is very hard to find, even other brands dun have.
So buy and standby first just in case.

the transfer part sounds fishy if u were already made a shareholder.
did u also grant him some other POA?
3 mths after we trf the shares via corp sec.
He yrf everything back to himself via his corp pass without our approval.
And mata says this ain’t a criminal case, but a civil one?
If say never make comment, means never make unless can prove he make the comment.
I think he might have forgotten or something.
It sounds like him.
To prove it definitively, we need sound engineers or some technical experts who can conduct voice forensic analysis to prove that it's really him or not.
I still think it's him.
I really salute people when everything is so obvious liao but they have the gut to deny.
i think is from WP.
r we able to do anything abt it?
Hmm if he dare lidat say I don’t think he’s lying leh.
could be someone else then ?
replying on fb comment seems to be a good way to clear his own name
means its all said by vivian?
Can vivian please clear this up.
Otherwise means his a even bigger ass 
Salute them lor.
he like not only losing his hair but also eyebrow slowly bo liao.
damn stress sia
I find it difficult to believe that VB made those comments himself.
The voice sounds different.
I still think LW made the comments.
Anyways, this requires technical experts from EDMW to prove it conclusively with some voice software or something.
Seems like him    .
Honest mistake move on
time for edmw CSI to get to work and produce the proof
Told u that house is haunted.
The way “lousy” is pronounced is a dead give-away.
 It’s LW; hear enough of his speeches and you know.
Initially it was just elitism.
 Now it’s also an integrity problem.
If not him then who?
No one has got the integrity to own up.
Yeah I oso agree with you.
 He looked when he heard it.
title say raised voice.
inside post hum chee ask what will happen.
i dun usually give dispute resolution advice on the Internet but my 2 cents:.
write a note "meet me at Tiong Bahru Plaza for trial by combat" then leave your telegram/whatsapp/signal to confirm timing.
also for a small fee or a buffet treat i can be the objective 3rd party referee ^^

The snake met his greatest nemesis.

Ceca snake deadlier than venomous snake.
The man has become double-headed snake now.
Why kill own kind?
So it's not a myth.
If you see a cobra and a ceca.
Kill the ceca first
The story of killing ceca over cobra is true!
RIP to the snake.
If 1 ceca and 100 cobras, in a room.
Who will you kill first?
For me, cecs first.
N release 100 cobras to the wild.
They are the real many headed snakes  
I had a very bad experience with C guy.
till now, still very angry whenever mentioned about C guy.
Actually they are not worth comparing to snakes.
snakes are thousand times better than them.
I know they eat snake but this is ….
Like to see him do that when a mosquito bites him

Certified siao lang.
Got gf still wanna hug underage xmm who isn't even interested in him.
And all the lame excuses he gave is really fvcking lame ttm.
What's wrong with the youngster these days?
If I’m the judge will sentence this guy full max penalty .

Breeding and selling hamsters nao!
why all these sex offenders so many csb.
keep their little bro in check everything safe alr, stupiak.
but xmm oso lucky nvr kena penetrate, otherwise really traumatized for life
moral of a lot of similar cases : parents better follow kids along, as long as it is anywhere outside of classes.
but kids these days oso hard to control.
should charge the hamsters too
lost balance then ended up on top of the girl?
What nonsense is this?
that is a different hamster that he is selling.
many sex predators out there.
girls need to be taught more on self protection from young
this kind shld rotan.
bt girl must also be more firm and say no the first time lah.
the pervert get wrong signals.
he prob think he score liao.
Aiya never let us play game
"You know how come I have so many hamsters?
Let me show you.
The gf how he is
I feel there’s a lot of reluctant talking and acting between the 3 Spider-Man.
I feel like a small immature kid who wants everyone to forget who he is so he can get to a desired university.
and then end up losing his aunt and his best friend and gf both forgotten him.
it is a sad ending story that makes me feel like my 2 hour wasted.
Doing stupid thing and end up losing everything.
to make this movie better, there should be a twist behind that Wang came back and help him change back to the day that he First visit him.
It should be a better ending that way.
finally Wang bring them go ktv sing hotel California.
New hobby in shangchi.
what do u think?
Worth the $ to watch?
I recommend watch at home.
movie targeted at kids.
very immature stupid mistakes inside.
the aunts purpose was to server water or saltwater, no help at all and she died
Its all about opening the multiverse for more opportunities to milk your money.
Who cares about the plot?
Wang as in Wang Leehom?
Yes, return the S$2,400+ jobs to Singaporeans First, keep the S$66K jobs to Ramesh.
At first I thought this was an ad and just scrolled past 
yesterday already say he will come out on this liao when Shan Ge called for debate 
Satki Lim Tean .
Shanmugum and team dare to accept Lim Tean challenge boh?
I would pay money to witness such a spectacle.
This PAP argh so defensive about this treaty.
Protect them machiam like protect their overlord.
when PAP is defensive means they got something to hide
Can mediacorp schedule a pay per view event if Shanmugum accepts Lim Tean to debate on live TV?
I willingly will pay $10 to watch
ok go help PSP now
I believe there is something incriminating that India has over Singapore.
this kind of extreme politics will only attract the extreme oppies.
very hard to gain any real ground
Lol lets see 3 wood root dare to accept the challenge anot hahaha
likely our political leaders
nazism and fascism was raising in germany before WWII because masses in germany was suffering due to the great depression
deep fakes nowadays very good sia!
Solid Deep Fakes!
Saw some tutorial using Nvidia G-cards to do these Deep Fakes, notch simple, need solid processing power
Wah deep fake dip dip
wah in a way look like LTK sia.
its very troubling that this can be done so well.
how to distinguish fact from fiction?
Deepfake really no horse run nao

Ordered an extra burger
I ish in sinkieland
that menu got me distracted & misread.
thot u're in France 
rooks civil to moi.
TS this is the best idea.
that cheater will come back and repay you.
Works 100% of the time.
If he can do this to you.
Do this back to him.
No need to show mercy.
He cheated you, now do what you should do.
SEXPOSE HIM ONLINE.
But ask lawyer whether that will complicate matters.
if it dose't then POST BIG BIG!
Report to Wanbao and Mothershit!
LET THE WHOLE SINKIELAND KNOW
I am more disappoint with the various agencies on their response and advice.
Will think abt wjat u said.
Nobody deserves to get cheated
Yes buddy, we have the acra printout of the subsequent change by him and it's indicated made by him.
This subsequent change is without any sipporting documents or agreements between share holders.
The puzzling point is that the police do not see that a crime is committed.
And Acra is not responding.
What other agencies shd i be approaching?
I wanted to talked to commercial affairs but they told me to lodge a police report and was assigned an IO.
Obviously the IO do not find any problem with the investigation.
the moment he refused your first request for bank signatory already can kick him out?
how many % you own?
wow then its a management decision to let him retain signatory i gues?
tbh edmw cant help much, this is a costly thing to rectify 
Are u even sure u can recover anything?
The company got anything to liquidate?
 What if the original owner show u accounts that they have been making losses all these while and your investment already wiped out?
Just did a insolvency search and he is bankrupt.
Getting anything seems doubtful.
But my shareholders wants to see justice done.
We may try to pursue the criminal aspect.
It not our decision to retain.
He refuse to add our names in as signatories after we added our names.
really angry to feed scammers .
Hope u and shareholders can get closure.
Lesson in life: never believe anyone(other than close family) no matter how nice or sincere they sound.
I got bitten multiple times and have basically lost faith in humans
In after revert back
I find it hard to believe ACRA didnt inform TS.
Usually gt email informing the directors.
isnt this cause to terminate him on the spot?
is he a shareholder?
what prevented you from getting rid of him then
You earn 5k per month but your wife smelly smelly $10k+ per month.

Shan challenges Leong to a ceca debate and Leong gamely accepts the challenge despite being up against a formidable minister.
Will Shan accept Lim Tean’s challenge on a TV ceca debate?
They gotta revamp their image man.
u dun get 4 people sit in front of the telly, keep quiet and 1 person talk.
why should 3 wood root accept a "challenge" from a nobody who is ranting in FB?
Anyway what he says, sinkies also don't like, because sinkies find him too aggressive.
Then just wait patiently for WP to raise the Ceca issue lor.
We all have time.
hope he join forces with leong to help him with the debate.
but he and csj should learn how to keep their cool and debate calmly.
It is true, Singaporeans in general find him too aggressive.
Talk so much for what, he should help Leong with preparations.
Only MPs are allowed to debate in parliament.
Can’t allow any tom dick harry to ask for debate.
Can’t just write FB posts on this and act as a leader.
Don't be surprised.
when phv drivers and food and parcel riders say .
who wants a $2,400 job when i can earn $4,000 easily by being my own boss.
Debates can be held in a public space as well.
 There’s no rule that restricts them within the confines of a parliamentary assembly.
if Shamugan and other pap ministers thinks CECA is a very good deal, they should come out and debate outside parliament
Want to debate why must go parliament to debate ?
Just open a Facebook Group or Facebook Page to open debate.
Let all join in
That is a wrong approach.
Because then anyone can ask for debate on any topic and ministers will have to oblige to debate them in public.
Who is Lim Tean to even ask for a debate?
He is just a private citizen like anybody else.
Just by giving speeches, posting on youtube and Facebook doesn’t give him any right to ask for debates.
It is the correct approach if the topic of debate is of national importance.
 And it’s not about Lim Tean requesting.
LIM TEAN is really my new favourite politician now.
my neighbour's black dog very humji one, only dare to barks at the weak and old.
saw big sized guy, diam diam hide one corner.
Dun dare one la.
will sure come up with some stupid excuse that he is not qualified la, he cannot represent citizens la, all that crap la.
You know the drill.
They are bullies.
Would be good to have miw vs Dr Thum, Lim Tean and of cos the person who was challenged LMW
ah gui lai liaooo 
But it's always been dead what.
Even the one at Dhoby Gaut damn dead except for the Korean eatery and bakery shop
no wonder so happy, so much space for chiu to play with 
I have never been there before.
Is SMRT a rail operator or property company?
While SMRT is sufffering with its low retail space take-up, HK MRT is booming like crazy!
Shops here are doing better and better.
If any of you guys been to the Central MTR station, it is like a mini city down there.
Above it is the IFC Mall.
Retail in HK has bounced back.
Good times ahead here!
cos many dun even know it exists.
my wife works nearby.
i went with my wife before
Rent to ghost for events
can catch spirits and bring there too 
Don’t stress that SMRT GM.
Probably he doesn’t know what to do also since Board will say no to anything that cost money, especially now SMRT is privatised and own by Temasak.
It will be near impossible to pull in an anchor tenant since retail is at its worst since Covid.
Anchor operator would rather choose to go into the mall which is keen to provide an attract rental since they will need to substantially fit the store.
That is why when interview, he says he is talking to prospective tenants but there could be none actually.
If open don don donki maybe will huat?
place is a bad fengsui.
lots of pillar with zizag pathway with broken Qi.
destinated to doom from start.
Who is that man on the .
Why post this pic.
In this thread?
“We have been trying to ask SMRT to give us some assistance, but the assistance that they gave us, in the form of some rental rebate, is actually not enough to cover (our operation costs) at all,” said one tenant who runs a food and beverage outlet, and was given a 20 to 30 per cent rebate.
Selling only 30 boxes priced at S$6 a day, she said it is nearly impossible for her to cover rental and overheads each month.
“How can we cope?
I almost want to commit suicide already… I don’t really know how to move forward,” she said.
SMRT has proven themselves to be blood suckers
Remember to thank LW for insisting that indians from india must be allowed to fly into SG.
The obvious happened and virus infections spiked.
Then they impose HA Phase 2.
30 boxes of what?
Ghost town still got 30.
Transactions during p2ha!
Top management by who.
always focus on getting more bonus.
Too bad the tenant got no choice.
All taken by same group of management.
Things that 100% can earn.
Same group of people will be taking over.
That's the reason why no improvement but price increase.
that's why always shoot the .
Bro, the mosquito must be blind or eye got stamp.
wow,  even a snake also can't tolerate them.
So the joke about Indian n snake make sense after all
They swim in Granges river and exalt cow biowaste.
Venom has nearly no effect.
ownself jiak ownself
the snake dammed rucky neber kena turned into a tenga by the other "relative".
The snake should know its place and not bite a bigger snake.
Really is never die before.
I had my fair share of experiences.
Other people without direct experience won't understand one, they only know how to talk c0ck say we xenophobic/racist.
I was under very immerse stress mentally.
even until now.
being smoking a lot too due to stress.
It’s a snake eat snake world over there
Classic snake bite snake!
It takes a Snake to know another.
See lah, the snake also know ceca die first.
Not to mention we pick one of them to die first.
Makes perfect sense what.
Means CECA is more dangerous than snakes.
Bitten by a krait is no joking matter lei.
Can be fatal deh whorx.
Hope he survive.
harnorhh mmm sii LW larr ish gui.
insai da Parliman huuuuhuuuuuuuuhuuuuuuuuu.
Ok I listened to the amped audio without the video.
I conclude that VB made the comments, not LW.
I retract my previous statements and apologize to LW.
The video is quite distracting, we would think LW made the comments just because his head was turning, but actually, listening to the audio without the video, and with amped volume, I trust that VB was the one who made the comments.
My apologies to the gentleman once again.
Maybe he deny so that next time this won't come back to bite him in the future if he become PM.
The place is haunted… knn macham ghost story now caught on tape/ mic
Zhun bo, it really sounded like him.
But since there’s no proof unless got voice recognition experts to disprove it, we also have to accept his denial.
Can he say ”Must be lousy school” again, i want hear it, funny leh.
”Whoever” said that just own up la, PAP minister cannot handle new age PR.
Look at Najib, Teflon.
Lying is worse than making an undesirable comment
If is he say, then tai ji liao liao.
can someone ask vivian to confirm he also said lousy school?
"every school ish good school".
Who's from Monk's Hill then?
seems LW still want the PM post.
i keep replaying the video, and still find 'lousy school' the voice and tone different from VB early parts.
unless because he turned his head away and affected the frequency or something
i suspect VB will be the fall guy for LW so as not to tarnish LW for PM.
i won't be surprised as VB is a cxxk sxxker to those above him.
I hear 3 different voices.
Aiya both by vb.
No need speculate speculate ar, maybe alien.
Don't look at video, and don't consider previous sentences (because someone can change their pitch when they start a new sentence).
Go to previous post with sound clip from Vocaroo and keep replaying the clip from 8 second to 11 second.
Just listen to that "must have been a lousy school" sentence.
Whose voice is that ?
Wow DOUBLE DOWN on his lies.
Didnt know Vivian can imitate Lawrence Wong 100%.
So talented VB.
Lawrence i lost all my respect for you.
You were my choice for PM.
Until you lost your balls.
Oppies still stirring this.
Minister VB comments also nothing wrong in first place

how comes now u the one posting kym threads.
but good effort
Chiobu spotted  .
He was seeking funding for his operations.
He did not let us know the full extend of his personal liabilities.
His personal liability is actually more than 1/2 mil outside.
When we invested he showed that he used the funds to buy raw material etc etc.
Little do we know suddenly all just stop ops.
We do not want to very micromangaing him, but the signatory issue was never resolved.
sorry for your issue bro, cant help you, but it seems the guy knew what he was doing when he took your money.
Thank you all anyway
This I will have to wait for Acra to revert liao
For the share transfer back to MD, it seems TS have to show proof to the police and ACRA that this was not authorised.
Your lawyer should also highlight this.
 Without that, don't think the police or ACRA can do much.
TS say the MD is a bankrupt?
He should be disqualified to be director.
Was he the only director before you joined?
TS hold 51% shares in the company now?
It is possible to get back control of the company, if you still want it.
Please hire another secretary agent or use your current lawyer to get this done.
And yeh, can sue him for the money, but unlikely you'll get back anything soon since the MD is a bankrupt.
It will be good to have a shareholder agreement done up and also do DD searches through a lawyer before investing in a business/company.
In the first place, why would this SSMC commit a $3m PO to this company if the company is not financially capable on fulfilling the order?
Never do basic vendor due diligence?
SSMC issued an open PO to the company.
The working model is that we send in goods to SSMC on consignment.
SSMC then will used the materoal and we will bill on a monthly basis based on stock drawn down.
The MD over projected his sales figure.
Reaching on 20 to 30k per month instead of at least 100k.
But we do not understand how the company suddenly ceased operations also.
He was not contactable since feb 2020
roughly need 50k to get back your 200k.
but if counterparty no money, ur 50k will be poorly spent.
usually this kind, ppl will still sue.
have seen ppl spend more than what theyre owed just to spite the other party.
Tq buddy, our investment is over 1/4 mil.
Aimming to sue for 1/4 mil at state court.
Minus 50k legal.
Hoping to get back 200k.
As i just said earlier, he decalre bankrupt liao.
So chances are low
aiya no need to worry.
CBT is a very powerful charge.
once reported and proven guilty, you den proceed civil suit.
now find lawyer also no use.
fight until the end, lawyer also cannot guarantee you money can take back immediately.
but lawyer fee u confirm must give.
Posted with AOS IS MY FAV HardwareZone Forums app
If you need good lawyer, let me know.
If he has a PO of $3mil from a reputable company like that, the bank SME loan section would be more than willing to loan him that measly $250k.
sounds premeditated to con
Didn't read the 8 pages.
MD and corp sec same person already an alarm bell.
Corp Sec should be independent.
Corp Sec needs to draft and sight the signed director's resolution that says you agree or resign from your position as director of the company.
Then the share transfer can take effect be it via Sales of share to be distributed as shareholder loan or paid in cash by the MD to buy outright.
Check if the company has been strike out or did the MD hire auditor to wind down company.
Likely it is strike out as its cheaper.
Strike out companies can reopen case where fraud is involved.
If TS got a copy of that PO then should verify with SSMC.
3 million usually need tender one.
Unlikely will be issue to small vendor.
Just read this.
Your chances are nil.
Now it's whether you want to spend more money and put him in jail for fraud.
This type no backing no money no other support cannot do huan.
no wonder bo lui.
He's gutsy and glad he is around in politics  but wish him to be more objective.
Rather he add firepower than claim credit.
can faster fix him can or not ?
If they really put down their faces, pride, power hungry mentality, they should form a coalition and force a good debate.
Currently bills passed has zero chance of being checked or refused one.
damn one sided.
Wait till senior position in banking, IT or any others sectors dominated by ceca national.
By then is not issue anymore lor.
he ish another csj in the making.
sinkies dun rike confrontational politics
Just wait for WP to raise the issue.
why stop there?
should open debate to edmwers too.
Wah like that also can ah 
You new to Singapore?
Its been like that for umpteen years.
It’s slightly better since last ge la.
I already sense LT is coming on this topic to score point.
blockchain voting siol.
already a nightmare to get people to use TT lmao
Ya sinkie rather wait 100 years for the next LKY to appear.
By the time, CECA also left this forsaken craphole.
He live up to his name, every topic also is lim teh material.
Ah neh will resign first if forced to debate.
Lol viet bu already earn 5 digit per month.

You not sian ah always insulting people and assume they have pathetic sad lives like you?
How many years you still one dimensional?
what does 1/1 mean?
You need to pay tax but viet bu don’t need .
So you still lose lol
The sooner you end your misery the better
You need to wake up from your cool story
I know my life.
You are just some miserable troll.
Follow the wind to where and how you wanna insult people
Aren’t your already insulting the viet bu n the BBFAs here .
Lol ownself pawn ownself

A doctor in a government hospital in Madhya Pradesh resigned on Saturday after some Congress leaders, including former minister PC Sharma, allegedly misbehaved with him following the death of a patient.
While MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appealed to people to boost the morale of doctors instead of demoralising them, Mr Sharma claimed he did not speak rudely to the doctor and was only involved since the patient was a member of his Assembly constituency.
"Our senior doctor Yogendra Shrivastava has resigned after some politicians misbehaved with him.
A patient in a critical condition was admitted to the trauma ward this morning.
Dr Yogendra told his family his condition was too critical.
During treatment he died, following which some politicians misbehaved with the doctor," Government JP hospital civil surgeon Dr Rakesh Shrivastava told PTI.
A video of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed Mr Sharma and former Congress corporator Yogendra Chouhan purportedly shouting at Dr Yogendra Shrivastava.
CM Chouhan tweeted, "Saddened by the incident, a senior doctor has resigned.
We live in a civilised society and right now it is the time to stand together.
Creating furore was neither in public good nor right in the fight against COVID-19.
When contacted, Mr Sharma said, "The doctor did not talk to me in the morning when the family of the critical patient was trying to get him to talk to me over the phone.
Instead, the doctor told them to take the patient to a private hospital.
snake eat snake world out there.
the sad thing is he got humiliated for doing the right thing.
sometimes I am ashamed of my own species
It isn’t the doctor fault.
It is the government failure for not being prepared for the pandemic.
they are too corrupted and not building more facilities and engage more doctors with budget but rather pushing the blame to the doctors and nurses.
There are more patients than what the hospital can cope.
just pull the mask off the guy shouting at him with expletives.
When politician can't solve problem, you just push or arrow.
I think for Singapore it should be fine to open its border to accept the people over to here for treatment.
Cause no point since India medical facilities are breaking down.
Singapore could extend medical support and earn revenue instead and increase humanitarian image.
Probably resign to save himself.
Imagine doctors working 18 hours a day now
He can cum here cont his practice , for sure our pappy will love him .
also, here no blame culture .
gotch any ppl die due to cobid, its bcos of our own complacency and fault for notch listening to gahmen and @ssperts .
even die after jab, also will say notch related to jab .
so, he will be safe and protected here .
On a separate note,  .
"A doctor in a government hospital in Madhya Pradesh resigned on Saturday after some Congress leaders, including former minister PC Sharma, allegedly misbehaved with him" .
i was wondering why the doctor had to resign just because he was naughty together with the politicians.
Anyway, the doctor quite poor thing too.
he should cum here!
CECApore welcums him with no blame culture and let's move on!
Kope-ship can kope.
dig out 4yo MC to stir issit?

aircon, cold drink and fried food.
Must be butt seggs in bunk.
western doc believe in these one meh.
the medical advice like from TCM
This MO is super good.
Got cut kkj skin.
know of someone who has been renting from smrt for almost over a decade.
Covid hit last year and SMRT still insisted on 20% increase in rental during lockdown period.
(FYI rental amount is in 5 digits so 20% is quite a lot).
Llst let the shop go.
Was empty for about half a year before they got some other tenant in.
make into bubbletea town
That’s One Raffles Place.
Basement got FOUR bubble tea stalls
how come hk tw Korea jippun mrt retail doing well.
Worst case just change to massage parlour.
Every station can relax
Only Popeyes can survive there
McDonald’s can, pizza Hard…
If no big brand anchor there, all the small brands lose to Shopee alr.
Would have closed sooner or later
Which big brand want to open at a place known as ghost town?
Lol, PAP keep building shiny malls like wat era alr, and pump up REITS but cnt capitalise on e-commerce
See la try to copy Japan train station + retail/F&B concept.
copy good idea, but **** execution  
linked to ION also manage until kanasai, really is full of s*** mgmt
building a mall before a row of sbopping malls is a great idea
Japan got rental caps for such establishments?
These shops are nothing new and not a novelty, every train stations in other countries has them.
But the paper general who took over does not seem to know how to help these shops and businesses prosper.
He just don't bother and leave them to their own devices .
Very sad, it's pathetic
PAP is a big failure under ah Loong.
Someone's vision lol, using mrt stations to milk sales, they think machiam like the jap subway train stations where shops are being located.
ironically it's warrants a fine if u eat and drink in the mrt .
yet most tenants are fnb
it's above Orchard MRT and linked to Taka.
Before covid from taka can just walk over.
now barricaded and can only enter by going up the escalator from orchard MRT.
nong nong time ago got popular there.
She looks younger than fann 
I want to merry her
She sell vegetarian food at circuit road.
Her husband orange juice stick got how many diplomas?
Well done Xiang Yun.
She is almost the ideal wife.
She is preparing for the day that her company undercut her for the contract extension or decide to cut her loose.
Her screen appearance decreased a lot since 2019.
Maybe the station may not want her any more.
that is Xie Shaoguang
She already earn a lot and nearing retirement age.
I'm sure she's fine.
Her family has a stall there last time
aging gracefully vs being dragged kicking and screaming
That one is a monk.
her children can take care of her
Diploma in Acting?
Women that looked acceptable when older are those that spend time and money to zhng.
How old is she?
she looks so much better than the z & f.
What's stall name and address?
But she does not man the stall personally right?
Seems like my hearing is failing me.
if he really lied, everyone in the conversation would know.
next if you see someone promoted if he were to become pm.
Sorry some of our ears here works better than the useless taskforce.
He lied blatantly.
da nasal voice jiin dangz leii…………….
I could winner this post a million times.
i think between them vb already agreed to front for all.
no point they sacrifice 2 right?
well well well.
then who could have it been.
need edmwer with voice analysis software to sexpose LW and disgrace him for good.
TSl just said he's from monk's hill.
nothing bad about that.
So many of us have been hearing his voice for so many fridays for TWO years already.
The "lousy" word is an 1000000% dead giveaway.
I lost all respect for this liar.
OYK how clueless he may be, i take that over LW intergity issue.
I mean if you already made up your mind that it’s LW no matter wat, then it doesn’t matter what they say.
Cause as long it doesn’t match your conclusion, it’s fake news
I though they should be whiter than white?
most likely VB was told not to say it's whom, same goes for TSL.
so VB is taking the fall for him
LOL, why you so worked up.
i didn't say yours fake news.
and it's not i made up my mind.
i'm just pointing out possible alternative.
if you can't take others with different opinions then you shouldn't be participating in a forum.
huai peepur fwighting izit da liang popo anotch harr?

KNN yee gong yee tio!
No blame culture please
The other thing we need to consider is personality, who is more likely to utter those words.
LW is more careful and conservative type.
VB is the "commentator" type, he likes to comment.
He also said about wanting to eat at hawker centre or restaurant.
This is his personality.
Meanwhile LW did not ever make such comments.
So I think the sentence "must have been a lousy school" is more consistent with VB personality and VB previous sentence.
It's more likely to come out from VB.
Quarantine for what ?
And how to quarantine ?
By checking thru all his handphone, social media, email, blogs, etc to check whether he ever engage in any anti-CCP activities.
And whether any of his friends, families, associates are in the black list.
If confirmed, can send him to XJ re-education camp to further quarantine.
quarantine for tiong peepur.
for all the ignorant ones, from Sept all international travellers to China MUST ENTER VIA GUANGZHOU and be quarantined centrally.
those going to China lip lai.

Camping here, will up your points!
This type usually braless at home  and won't hesitate to press her boobs against her brothers or Dad.
  very open minded.
She turned les.
Face rooks photoshopped

Jeanette Aw and Paige Chua still okay lah.
Have AMDK bf cant be too airport kind .
Still need to have curves
Lousy means lousy
why most of the safe entry staff ive seen are mostly aunties and bbfa uncles?
Paige Chua shoulder meaty kind so to me not airport .
Jeanette Aw has slight bumps for boobs and big ass so  for me they r figure is not bad
more like shuqi.
3 mil he claim.
It was an open PO for 3 yrs, 3 mil was based on the consumption of the plant.
They bidded for this PO before we got involve.
After securing this order, then the MD came to me.
The PO is legit, we were supplying to SSMC for a few months, but at a much smaller quantum than projected.
You sure ssmc allow blanket PO for 3 years?
That is strange for a big company.
They offered a 3 year cost down pricing scheme and they got a 3 yrs P.
This one not cbt?
Corp sec and MD not same entity.
MD changed shareholding unilaterally using corp pass.
TMD Acra website facing tech issue, cannot extract info*
Tq buddy, he bankrupt liao.
Need to talk to share holder abt course of action.
TS so what is the status?
What is the next course of action that you can take against him.
Most importantly can you expose him online?
The other share holder not free today.
Tomolo will meet up and talk.
Likely we cant get anything out of the MD liao.
It's obvious CBT liao.
Dunno issit ACRA see him bankrupt liao dont want to charge him.
As mentioned, if there are no implications for exposing the cheater online after consulting lawyer.
Then you can report this on Facebook, to wan bao, Xin Ming, mothership, 158 and even EDMW.
I mean that cheater cannot hide corporate veil, do such things and not get caught.
Have to expose him otherwise others will do the same.
Then magically things will be solved somehow
the Israeli human resources professional packed her bags for New York with her husband and children this month.
Lol good luck finding job in NY

inter coy transfer over
FT come sinkieland.
sian of 'stressful lifestyle' here, still can go back country side live.
cb sinkies forever stuck here.
Singapore attracts mercenaries.
This is what I called them Ftrashes n Ctrashes .
Both come here desperately to work.
Both desperately want to get out of spore.
Remind me when I go for ICT to defend this kind of humans
Expats will come and go.
It's a pity MTF xenophobic policies have made them felt unwelcome.
u have a choice
Good continue the empty promises given to the people many ft will see it themselves.
They will NEVER lift the restrictions no matter how many jabs u take.
We are not talking abt the merry go round from 2-5-8 pax game .
We are talking about letting the people to lead a normal life and not check in when u need to go buy groceries in supermarket.
and how is it singaporeans fault again?
Pak cham still need wear mask .
endemic still wear mask?
These are the fairweather expats who cannot take a bit of hardship.
We don't need such weaklings.
They can fug off.
That’s why it’s empty promises again.
Sinkies are crazy to believe the promises again and again when none of it is being given.
Yah fark off and don't come back.
Amdk or south Asia?
Even sinkies also leeches lah.
Just that many of us want to run also nowhere to run
1 go out 3 come in
Ppl say outside food all unhealthy try to cook at home.
But cooking jin tiring.
Is fish soup healthy?
My friend said many msg
I find kfc healthier
You never know what goes inside the big cooking pot of soup.
Buy raw fish, buy boiling water from drinks stall.
cook the raw fish with the boiling water.
Sure healthy, no msg or added flavour.
Taste the natural freshness of the fish cooked to middle well done.
Just fish plus water.
I tried to cook fish soup at home.
With tofu n spinach.
Add a bit of salt.
2021 liao still got people believe the msg hoax?
U find the soup tasty and your mum cooking not tasty?
Gxgx tasty food usually is unhealthy and your mum cooking is healthy that's why it tastes healthy
It's usually the soup stock that may be unhealthy.
Depends on how the hawker prepare the stock.
Some stalls I know take hours to boil the soup and they use chicken, pork bones, fish bones, beans, onions, garlic etc.
 Minimum salt and no msg.
Some stalls take the short cut and just use rice water with some chicken bones, and a tonne of msg, salt and fish sauce.
If you think the soup has a lot of msg, just skip the soup.
Unless they say they no put msg, usually most outsai food got put.
get those with spinach ones.
You want healthy, you want to hiam no taste.
Got taste, means flavour gao gao.
flavour gao gao means, si mi sai also put inside.
Then you don't think healthy anot lor.
I ever talk to a friend doc.
most of fish soup is full of msg.
sodium and salt.
It is infact very unhealthy.
Tell me to eat ok.
but avoid drinking too much soup
Can do pepsi bljnd test.
One outside hawker.
One ownself cook with msg.
One ownself cook without msg.
Then can really tok
I think more like when the soup left over alot so they add water and add msg to top up so the soup ish like cook long long liao then got the full flavour.
The 'take hours to boil the soup and they use chicken, pork bones, fish bones, beans, onions, garlic etc.
' sound like wife cook for family then will use the effort to slowly boil the soup into flavour.
I usually skip ramen soup.
U should benchmark the taste of your mum's cooking for healthiness if u r unsure.
Or u can refer to hospital food
nowadays Sg diners very smart one .
once they detect the high level of msg and sodium .
they will siam the stall forever, unless they enjoy and don't mind the artificial flavouring.
Thats why some fish soup stalls are more popular than others, and usually it's the food quality that attracts the long queues.
i think the only food that's truly healthy if u eat out is salad with no dressing.
fish soup not necessarily more healthy bec its lower in oil but there are fried fish soup also many fishes used actually are high in mercury.
soup stock wise also a lot use too much msg.
Just average only
Bedok Food Centre?
I tried before.
tiagong amk that one better
alrd comes w/ egg & begedil: $2.
Too famous in the past but actually only normal
aussie there have anot?
Have Asian food but cannot compare the taste like that
Any stalls that are not the sweet kind?
This one no where near the best.
Those power ones got an old school taste, i can't describe but very hard to find these days.
Dunno how to apprrciate.
More of mee soto guy
I absolutely disagree.
The best one should be this one.
This guy pwn everyone !
Only good about Inspirasi is cheap.
Don't fancy the taste.
One of their neighbours lagi worse.
Only belachan and haebi taste.
Maybe is another style?
Nowadays quite hard to find a mee rebus with thick peanut sauce + tau cheo.
Can try Inspirasi neighbour.
Can't remember exact store.
Pretty salty, haebi + belachan taste.
One dimensional to me.

The ending meetup for wat.
during my time when i first log into edmw without a nick, it was epic.
i think back in 2005 towards 2010 has alot of saga n very entertaining in here.
most memorable saga was matchy and ce_lau story.
they got to one another in real life, thatntime got plenty of gathering in edmw one.
then they got to know one another n start spendin time solo, then one day got dispute.
cuz matchy is a gambler , like to bet to soccer , thus only have $10 budget per day.
cannot spend more than that when dating, then ce_lau mm got angry and all.
then matchy blame her for not stopping him from gambling.
then one day apparently, ce_lau kena preggy by one of the edmwer here then dissapear liao.
but matchy is still here.
if you think ccb is chio, wait till you see gloria
Wah got saga siol
Gloria vs 940 leh?

Most other retail stuff unless it's branded, people could just get online.
Yea don don donki.
Or they should hav jus put their Ion Hawkers' street there.
You see the Don Donki at Novena MRT.

So Many Retails Toh….
I think all shops in exchanges doing badly.

They government has parachuted in too many inexperienced guys from Mindef.
This place always nice and quiet.
The justasia always quite full in the past.
Too bad the layout is damn weird
U guys move further down to suntec and marina sq will see even moar ghost towns.
Dun knw how long these malls can tahan.
Sg all along too dependent on ft and tourists riaos to support mall businesses.
There are a few.
Raffles Place XChange.
Dobby Ghaut XChange.
But the shops are those chapalang accessories shop, food, etc.
nothing really worth visiting for in the first place.
very good for her
Some ppl further their studies for leisure.
Most do it for survival.
58 this year liao.
Still looking really good, for a Singaporean woman.
Maybe last time when she was young.
I can recognise that stall if I past by.
She go local uni sure kenna fk de
Jus be spokesperson for some company lol, other jobs out dere sure cannot compete with the FT legion la.
Wah, means she must be some hot diva in her 20s-30s.
Seems like there's no photo of her younger days being displayed on the net 
I am not sure whether she actually earning if her main income is from the tv station.
I dunno about what side income she is doing like what her colleague Ben is doing.
If there is any, then it is good for her.
Her children are still young.
It is uncertain that Chen Xi will make it in the station with so much competition.
I understand that her gal is still studying.
It is unknown whether she can do it or she will become what her dad did in chasing his passion all the time.
who want fk her?
She is not those hot looking type.
Typical greedy sinkie.
Alot of my friends also took many course.
Coz subsidised by gahment.
No need go out of the house.
what a waste of money.
Not sure what value addedness are there
What is her husband doing
So has she switched career now after getting so many useless diplomas?

The voice was so distinctly .
Anyway got those voice matching software to identify the person who said that?
it's someone who's angling himself to be the next PM.
it's about integrity and that's a very serious matter.
need to get to the bottom of it.
Whitewash IB marching in with nonsensical reasoning liao.
ownself talk, ownself reply, ownself reply monk's hill?
there are obviously 3 different voices.
1st VB, 2nd LW, 3rd TSL
You’ve never worked in society before.
The most smiley, friendliest people out there are typically the most conniving.
 They just hide it very well to make you let your guard down.
 In the highest echelons of politics, even more so.
The ones beside him and the one behind him are the likely ones.
I thought a heard a particular minister's voice but he's a little too far away.
The one behind VB is quite likely to be one of them?
behind VB is Koh Poh Koon who was an RI boy and son of Punggol
Lets assume LW lied.
if its LKY era.
LW just dugged a grave for himself by putting it on the record.
denying saying what he had said.
Anyway, I think PM Lee knows the truth on who said that "lousy school" comment.
Think he is too shrewd to say something like that.
moi believe too how he survive if he was actually the one who said it.
miw will be the first to backstab him and downvote him no need all the who who sjw owl come jjww riao
i think u r the v worked up one.
he never say he cannot live with your comments too.
Wow the plot very similar to Squid Game Episode 6, every man for himself!
If not him, then tell us who loh.
He definitely heard it anyway since he was sitting in the middle of the conversation
lol your ear got problem.
the lousy school part is a totally different pitch and intonation
govt nv lies, thus its not him confirm
but lousy school comment sounded like different pitch and tone and intonation .
the word "lousy" was said a particular way that is distinct.
I assure u that i will vote for u nxt election
lol bro there's only ONE fact.
only ONE person had made the comment.
it's not up to anyone's interpretation.
you statement makes you sound like a wu lai lol.
So TT Vivian made a statement and he answered it himself?
They should admit who said that
which one new sign up got rebate and cheapest now?
keen to know too
Speaking of which, mine too…….
buy wholesale electricity.
once you go wholesale, you won't regret.
but sp wholesale no fixed rate right
dont have deals liao la.
time for them to recoup.
if got pls sic
I just signed up Sembcorp for two years.
Rate per kwh is 0.
Think today should be last day to sign up since SP electrical tariff will increase by tomorrow.
in b4 SP Wholesale
You can ask on the OEM thread there.
State your average usage per month.
Else just use SP wholesale if your usage is high > 500/600 kwh/month
Ya hor,  thanks TS for this reminder
Ohm lousy riaos nobody use?
eat liao thirsty?
  thirsty = msg gao gao; no thirsty = pang sim jiak
nth is unhealthy.
as long as everything eat moderately i think should be fine
Simple guide: anything that tastes good is unhealthy.
yong tau hoo rice with soup should be healthy as well.
u need to marinate the fish with soy sauce and sesame oil let it absorb then boil
I came into this thread expecting to see ”It’s not healthy if you dine outside, but it’s healthy if you dabao” responses 
have you tried before in public?
Got people call IMH come and catch you?
I saw before this guy took out a loaf of bread and placed every single slice on the hawker centre table.
Dirty AF, I know, but seemed like he was taking stock of his bread.

Vampire can fly.
Drop werewolf from height can liao.
Werewolf see ma xiaoling zehzeh will turn into colour wolf.
A person of culture, I see!
I am partial to Tremere.
Definitely this guy.
nv heard of thousands years age of werewolf or werewolf biting another human turning them into werewolf.
sadako trumps both!
Actually, half of werewolf stories are of people bitten by another werewolf.
The other half of the stories, are born with a werewolf gene.
And then there are stories where there are both werewolves that were created and purebloods that were born.
To be able to reproduce, as in, to give birth, which vampires can’t .
I’d say it’s a draw against living forever.
U all dont know.
Snakes, king cobra are the strongest.
Vampire gets the girl, but werewolf gets their daughter.
So who stronger?
Vampire got one fatal weakness.
They like dead people during the day.
easily killed then.
depends if u r pedobear or not.
If course vampire
Last time quite easy to find, even those primary school stalls got that special taste mee rebus, i can't describe how's the taste like but i think most uncles know what i am talking about.
Bedok 58 there got one come close, but sauce is too thick.
one of the worst actually
Thick peanut sauce will be in AMK central hawker Centre .
It’s like super thick
Famous because last time got $2
When come to food is up to individual taste.
The famous nasi lemak stall at changi point.
Everyday long Q.
But to me it was average.
In fact neighbouring Mizzy stall taste better.
for moi ish the joo chiat one 
Bedok 58 got one new stall , open beside the indian mee goreng that always open evening time.
saw a lot of people eat that mee rebus stall.
Parkway Parade basement B4 the major renovation used to have a good mee rebus stall, young that time I take special bus trip to go there eat one.
Best Mee Rebus I've ever had was a Malaysian Hawker.
Boiled with crab shell, it's got bits and pieces of crab there, with chopped prawn fritter and potato+tomato broth.
sadly it's gone, now his franchaise called RAMLY Mee Rebus is all over but taste not quite the same.
Still good though.
And they are not proud.
eat my black seaweed nicer.
AMK central one better
amk one jin ho jiak.
Serangoon Garden … mee rebus, soto ayam and mee soto.
I stay Jurong and that’s the only stall that can make me drive all the way there if I crave for good mee rebus.
For me is Sungei Gedong camp canteen  
Rahim and Afandi very good!

Many many condominiums full of such “talents” who cannot make it back home - if all of these people can fug off then I’ll be delighted sia.
If such sinkies did not and/or unable to ‘upgrade’ themselves, .
wanna blame who leh?
Just go rah 1 expat go, 3 will come replace them huan.
Not the first time like that liao, they never wanted to stay here forever in the first place .
No mask hope they kena covid again and again until see they scared covid or covid scared them 
Why open big big liao, still people run away hah?
They shd pay for public services like police, scdf, defense.
To replace any 1 ang moh who leaves, there are at least 10 Million indians from india fighting and jostling to be first in queue to swarm into SG.
When choosing a city, expats are not bothered by mask wearing + group number limits.
This is the truth.
They want SAFETY for themselves and their family.
They won't get robbed or mugged.
They want extremely High Pay.
They want generous Housing Allowance from Employer.
They want maids and servants.
They want generous Car allowance or Free company car.
They want a city where everything works.
Reminder that pap's retarded half assed flip flopping COVID policies are a result of them giving in to 3rd world trash in the first place
must ban face mask for foreigners !
only sinkies carry the virus
one group of expats go.
another will come.
these expats (might as well call them tourists) will seldom be happy to settle here
do not come back here to work ever again
Go home and don't come back lah bhutto
This is another example of half or partial truth painted by the main stream media in Singapore to suit their narrative.
Yes, it is true that quite a number of expat families have re-located from Singapore over the last two years.
I have had four expat colleagues that left Singapore over the last two years, citing the strict COVID restrictions here.
But their jobs did not go to Singaporeans.
It went to new FTs coming into Singapore, two for the first time.
And I personally know of two expat families I know personally that just flew in over the New Year via the quarantine free VTLs from the US and HK.
There is even one expat I knew who returned home in June 2020 at the height of the first Wuhan wave.
But came back in December 2021 because he couldn't find a job back in his home country for 1.
In the end, he got a new job in Singapore again through his white boys expats network.
So much for fair weather FTs; when they cannot find another better job elsewhere, they will still come back to Singapore.
Else, you think the 400 or so imported daily COVID cases are all incoming tourists eager to snap pictures at the Merlion or Sentosa?
For those who went to tourists spots like RWS recently, you'll know it's a dead town at all the tourist spots with the majority of the restaurants catering to foreign tourists staying shut.
At RWS, the Korean food court is closed for good and Malaysia Street is barely hanging on to its life, operating at 1/3 capacity.
So even at an infection rate of 4%, 400 imported COVID cases daily simply means around 10,000 foreign travellers are flying into Singapore every day and I dare say most of these incoming foreign travellers are not holding short-term tourist visa.

The Gov wont lose one, retail/rental make more money than rail business.
This whole damn exchange above Orchard Station used to be a super huge Popular bookstore.
Not sure if all you old birds can remember.
But yes it is.
Maybe even way before Saw's era.
SMRT used to own all these spaces since it's paid in full with coffers.
They won't care whether it will rent out or not.
Sounds like jialat mgt from landlord
Only Jollibee or Starbucks with many many seats for students can survive there.
Incidentally I was at raffles place X Change and it seem lots of units are untenanted.
I suppose that’s the familiar scene all over town.
still smrt has not maximized its real.
Estate potential with it commanding all prime real estate space.
dhoby exchange and then marina bay has fantastic empty unit for ages.
Some stations has the power utility occupiying the station space.
Any other country where the govt use public transport’s Marketting business and real estate business to subsidize cost?
Want to copy the concept from the Japanese but fail miserably….
Japan underground metro malls got pet shops got arcade got a lot FnB outlets….
Singapore ones like walking through a ‘under construction’ site / shuttered corridor… really no life.
seems like a good location but for some reason I’ve never seen smrt advertise it or heard about it or even manage to pass by it.
The underground metro mall thing is not a .
Japanese concept lah.
It's all over the world even in.
City Link is one example mah.
Just that this don't know what xchange thing was.
Japan JR and third sector railways like Keio buy the land, build the railways and train stations, then build the shopping centers around the train station.
Ya is like sandwich upstairs.
Only got popeyes and some wmother shops there
Only bought food from Poepeyes chicken last month, got a shock it’s like ghost town upstairs.
Even pre covid it was already a dead town.
Who da fug would wanna go there seriously?
I only pass through to get to a bus stop.
SMRT as a landlord can enjoy the empty hoarded stores lor
Relocate the MRT gate entry to B1, and shops to B2.
This will make more economical sense.
Everybody misses the retail and F&B there unless you are taking MRT and transferring a bus back home.
Its near the Ion escalators to the bus stop along Orchard Boulevard.
Never even seen the entrance of it before.
that's how much SMRT bothers to advertise and help tenants.
The location is actually damn good.
Just directly above Orchard Station all under shelter.
It used to be a huge Popular bookstore holding that space during the early days.
Actually should just rent the entire space out to Don Don Donki they should be able to prosper but they act smart and sub-divide it into smaller shop units now so it's too late.
Why the article make me feel like my 3 years full time diploma sound useless, when anyone can get part time diploma, multiple somemore in just 2 years time…

Way too long, going to have a hard time sleeping tonight.

Went to sleep at 4pm afternoon.
 Wake up and see its 430.
  Get ready for dinner then stop and wonder why it's so dark.

Little wonder he was a divorcee.
Liar liar all the way.
No integrity is worst or lousy school is worst?
The govt should realize that this is never going to go away.
Better address it squarely head on than let it fester and let the opposition folks use them as cannon fodder.
As they surely will

The voice is so distinctively LW's  I will need to go for ear examination soon.
Even my nephew who found last week N Level Listening Comprehension tough due to the unusual accent said the voice was clearly that of LW.
You dont need guts to lie
How can anyone be so shameless?
Yah its not LW.
If only a few heard the lousy sch comment as LW voice, then there's high chance these few heard it wrongly.
But when most who heard it can identify that comment strongly as LW's unique voice, then there is strong evidence to suggest it is LW voice.
It cannot be most heard it wrongly.
To be identified later when some voice engineer use forensic tech to proof it is his voice will be a catastrophe for LW.
He is really taking a huge risk.
Nope, public hair on fire better.
No need boyzillian!
What do you suggest?
And how trustworthy are our media?
Ever heard of onscreen personality?
Media will say the audio/video online are doctored?
when in doubt, vote all of them out
there are better tools than this la.

I do know one or two person from SMRT Properties, now they are offering a 3 tier rental cut for 3 years.
first year you pay less, second year you pay the average rent and 3 year you pay more.
To help tenants cushion some of the impact with their cash flow.
Got such thing?
How come my friend’s one don’t have.
Only new units?
For renewal contracts, need to bargain with them and tell them due to covid business been hit.
They take back do what.
Traditionally, vampires are some of the strongest creatures in games.
Like Witcher 3 they are imba.
Werewolves strong but not same level.
Must see is which type from which movie or drama.
PAP Vampires are the most dangerous.
Werewolves fast attack speed.
Greater Werewolves - super high regeneration.
Vampires not so strong damage.
Vampires level drain you - a kind of weakening.
All your attributes drop.
In short vampires attack a weakened you.
When vampires die, must perform some action to make sure it doesn't resurrect.
I tink ish pontianak 
Dracula is the father of all vampires.
No werewolf can win him.
Vampire control werewolf.
Active at night.
Werewolf can only active at night + full moon.
Cinematic universe failz at mummy liao
Who is the father of all werewolves ah?
Vampire better, get to pump Kirsten Stewart
bite WhyNPNT la.
Vampires stronger, werewolfs only brute force, use saliva to fight.
 That’s why the vampires rule the werewolves.
That's just how they pro-create ma?
Dinosaurs lay egg.
 Human have sex.
 Doesn't mean dinosaurs weaker than humans.
Hybrid the most powerful  
Werewolf also ma.
Only got moon can transform 
movies always put it as vampires smarter, werewolves physically stronger.
Oh I just recall one more place that got good mee rebus … the Kimly coffeeshop at TradeHub21
Last time parkway parade food court got 1 mee rubus always long queue .
DUno shift to where nao
This stall famous for mee soto, u go eat mee rebus?
this isn’t central right ?
at chong boon food centre?
Where’s the marine parade mee rebus anyone knows?
Those born in 80s would know
they claim imm got staff canteen very nice , anybody try b4?
I know they got put chicken meat.
Haig road , good ‘n’ jolly
it is our neighbors.
when young selling them in school tuckshop.
now old grandma .
but still made for us only
best mee rebus ish at pulau ubin
one of the cheapest ard, yes .
even their mee soto which used to be their "signature" dish, nao dunno what kind of MSG they spam insai sumtimes can taste that salty salty aftertaste .
anw, if toking abt malayu mee rebus the one in Haig Rd that one imho fweel much better than this Inspirasi .
rast time moi work ard Paya Lebar there, every 2-3 days in a week during lunchtime will jiak the mee rebus .
Afandi Hawa & Family Mee Rebus, Haig Rd: Mee Rebus made with shrimp, flower crab & mutton
TS have a simple life.
Satisfied by below average food
Those who missed the parkway basement one, it is now located at haig road hawker, facing the mall.
one thing the bedok one does right is that they give a lot of noodles, eat sure full one.
Definitely NOT true that Inspirasi is the best mee rebus.
I have eaten more than once there.
The standard has dropped a lot compared to the past.
There are better mee rebus elsewhere in SG.
either the egg looks big or the plate is small
Haig road food Centre has a stall that sells old school style Mee rebus

But it we need to always compare all these negative demonstrations to show that we are good, we are ignoring the problems and will soon lose the plot
no need loan buy house?
later little pink angary sia.
what he said is not entirely true also.
Fairer to use multiples of annual income to judge affordability
Sinkies really earn 20k per month.
no retrenchments or salary cut during this period.
grads come work earn 10k per month, no traineeships at all.
Many good years ahead
multiple of annual income .
He was not wrong.
Choose between matured estates, town and new estates.
No one ask u to buy those 4room BTO tat cost half a million

Moi too young so only knew boxing from tyson's era.
Float like butterfly sting like bee style was the best?
Depends on the what you want believe.
Not steven lim?
Well known for his dazzling footwork and his unorthodox defense style.
Dont know about GOAT but I think Tyson is the most dominant boxer ever.
Boxers actually fear and dont want to step into the same ring as Tyson.
And all his knock outs are extremely impressive.
Tyson ish a beast lol, ali I think is more of a tactician.
Note I only post those who posted their images public on social media before aka facebook / friendster / blogspot era.

Diploma is already useless when idiotic employers recognized degrees from some village in delhi more just because of the word degree
She is much better than me.
I've only obtained multiple fractures.
It’s been about 2 years of Covid pandemic.
What sort of diplomas are these in which several can be simultaneously obtained by an individual during this timeframe?
I would like to give her multiple orgasms
Actually at her age is just for fun or goal fulfilment only.
I doubt she will actually use the cert for anything.
Nevertheless good for her.
Likely she is studying for interest, self fulfillment etc, not for a new job 
Local polytechnic can go fly kite already.
Full time studying minimum 3 years to get a diploma.
She can get multiple within 2 years plus, local institution must be damn lousy at teaching.
No Uptron no talk.
She may not want to stay around to replace JYJ as the station Ah Ma.
She may be calling it quit if the tv station decided to give her a lousy contract and showing her some major disrespect.
2 yrs obtain multiple diplomas?
No wonder our academic certs all no value now, so easy to get so many diploma?
Is there a catch in the article?

Jews are very cliquish in big companies.
To me, I consider them to be the white version of Indian nationals.
They have this under-siege mentality and always keep the lucrative jobs among themselves.
A lot of "closet Jews" in NYC.

I go Sheng Siong can get 10 pack of eggs at $1.
75 depending on market and season but go NTUC minimum chao chao $2 for the "Pasar" eggs at NTUC.
NTUC "Fairprice" really is "Fair" price.
moi ish give Sheng Siong "Excellent" price.
NTUC got one period all eggs very cheap.
Like buy 2 free 1.
fairprice has 10eggs for $1.
next time u go and look in egg section, smartchoice or something.
Sheng Shiong got many other things also cheaper than NTUC.
NTUC is pricing itself out of the market.
Feed too many JLB.
Wow I think CS would be unsatisfactory.
Need Ng Chee meng and fellow JLB salary ofcourse cannot give bonus like sheng shiong.
Sheng Siong many things cheaper than ntuc
NTUC only if your area doesn't have Sheng Siong.
Ntuc like to leave the rrp high high and then ownself promo until the 'normal' price range of other stores to bruff chewren  
SS eggs are bigger also, compared to Ntuc one.
not every items.
Some are more ex
Giant vegetables already cheaper than fair price liao
moi usually is buy from SS the 10+2 60g egg @$2.
so far budget eggs between the 2 has been quite reasonable.
500gm for 10 eggs, that's abt the decent size.
cheaper ones at $1.
45: newborn eggs from SS.
a wee bit smaller, maybe lesser than 500gms in a pack.
tried the latter before.
not that bad imo
That was the time govt and ccs panic buy from Poland I think.
Then buy 20 get 10 for $4 that's fun.
Now no more liap
I recently bought the pasar eggs also $2 from FP, I remember last time was $1.
pasar eggs are not the cheapest nao.
FP inhouse brand smart choice is 1.
it's not fixed.
that's why if u see it as reasonably priced, must fhfl .
but depends if u really need it oso or has space left to keep it in the fridge

That was basically the only station I tuned in to until they decided to turn it into an indie + local acts themed station

Maybe you saw them ish faster movement, switch to flight mode all that.
Combat wise they're more caster, spell type, drain 'essence' eg.
Depends whether turn into werewolf still can think like human.
Werewolves are stronger on full moon.
Vampire bite werewolf becum what.
Werewolf scratch vampire becum what
For me I am team BELLA
Mix of both better.
tiagong werewolves are vampire's pets, maciam dogs are human pets.
If vaccines can make them up lorry then both ish not strong 
Moi use werewolf always beat the vampire one last time in games.

Not much places u can buy a 5 room size hdb for just $700,000 .
Credit must be given due .
Needs to produce the PAP elite who said it.
Otherwise saying I didn't do it is insufficient for matter to end just like that
no need to doubt that all of them are from the same party and are doing good cop bad cop routine.
Lawrence said not him means not him hor 
Means pap is a party that condones liars.
They dont take actions when their party members lie in broad daylight .
what a lousy party!
But I won’t be surprised when Vivian is Goh Chok Tong’s age, he will write book to reveal the truth about the RI is a lousy school comment 
if it was workers party who said it, be prepared everyday media start shaming them for being irresponsible, no dignity.
I assure you, his reply is as transparent as PAP.
Who wants to buy such crap.
Its one thing when they're in power and people buy such crap in bulk.
But see so many of LKY's many books destined to be recycled for better use like toilet paper.
Those rich companies and businessmen who spent tons on his autographed books, I wonder how they feel.
Irony is someone who come out and urge them to admit it and apologize cos integrity is so important .
That person is TT Vivian

Luckily, these comments not passed by opposition,  else we will see this becomes our daily headlines.
Time to ask VB whether he made the lousy school comment liao.
Got to double confirm not made by LW.
If not him, then who?
Dun tell me Vivian was talking to himself?
Why Parliament got such unsound people in the house?
Any experts here know how to do voice identification?

The "secret" of mee rebus lies in its sauce or gravy , that what make or break the jhj-ness of it .

Not sure if people taste have gone bad or weird twisted already.
plz sic country that allows FT to live there easy easy.
With or without Covid they would have gone to NYC lah.
Ask sinkies to repent?
the husband is house-husband ?
charboh here should have her mindset then can increase birth population.
The thing I like about AMDK and other FTs like Japanese are they dont like to stay here permanently.

Best news article for the day
foreigners think sinkiepore is heaven - place to make money and enjoy - until they get a real taste of the pap gahmen.
One less of these virus spreaders.
Hdb bigger size leh for same price / rental.
But yup, its low ses
Quite a few of my coy expats came here with the expectation that they can travel and explore South East Asia.
They were disappointed these years due to covid restrictions.
The timing too suay for them.
But don't feel sorry for them, they are on inter coy transfer and free to go back after 3 years.
Robert sun walk home .
The elite management style only the south east Asia and China citizen can take it.
Other nationalities will struggle.
It's very different mindset.
These expats come here to command and conquer meaning making decisions.
Not listening to decisions from our elites.
Serve and Fxxx Off.
If can't have EVERYTHING, would rather have nothing.
It would be sad and tragic if it is ultimately foreigners that can convince the gahment to do certain things while citizen opinions hold no sway.
Byebye, dun come back then
SS eggs or other stuff , sometimes it is really cheaper than NTUC.
But SS fresh prawns, sometime is more expensive than GIANT.
If Giant got promotion on fresh prawns, really super cheap.
You mean their egg price will change according to demand and supply?
Go different supermarkets to buy their loss leaders lor.
Can save money .
The Supply mainly 
  got this brand ah?
  never see b4
In a cheap soft plastic shell lol.
500g onli per pack.
all the small small eggs
NTUC is the fairest price set by govt and unions.
Too cheap is unfair price.
That is call Fair Price not cheapo Price .
The pap has how many people in NTUC?
not sure of the reason but am sure u shld be aware that the price will never stick to the same, permanently.
maybe this week cost $x.
next wk cld be either up or down by xx cents
which low ses outlet store it?
amk hub, tpy mrt, j8 all hab.
ang mo supermarket has items that are cheaper than either sheng siong and NTUC.
usually frozen stuff.
but some of their drinks are slightly more expensive though.
Ntuc stupid ng chee meng
Many places also cheaper than NTUC.
How freaking ironic
So many JLB to feed , how to sell cheap ?
Cheap where to find $ for them.
You want them to drive grab neh if they out of job.

It depends on how many vampires vs werewolves.
If two vampires against 20 werewolves, werewolves will win.
Btw vampires and werewolves rumoured to be from the dark hold book.
So one  scarlet witch will own them all gaogao
Depends on your definition of stronger.
Have you seen werewolves own castles?
Stronger as in fighting lor.
Not fight money.
Vampire also mah.
Vampire stronger unless full moon
Before gay shinning vampires become popular, werewolves are typically use as minions or followers by vampires in many RPG setting one.
So in most story vampire ish much more OP than werewolves or even the master of werewolves.
In most fiction, vampires are more powerful but i think that is really most due to their mind control and charm.
Hence most vampires have a lot of underlings even powerful ones which make them very powerful.
In a one on one fight, i dont see how werewolves are inferior .
In fact vampires weakness to sun is one major Achilles heel.
I know werewolves weakness to silver but come on .
being killed by sunlight is one major weakness.
Werewolves better cos Vampires suck.
Think ish depend which fantasy setting.
Cause in many high fantasy fiction, the higher level vampire, especially those ancestral lord and elder level ish either immune to sunlight or have some form of sun resistance that enable them to still survive or even live normally under sunlight.
Just that in most case even if they are immune to sun normally they can only fully utilize their mythical dark power (as high fantasy fiction lord and elder level vampire normally process the same dark power as demon and devil, but unlike demon and devil their dark power are weaker in the daze) at night nia, but they still able to retain most of their traditional power in daze time like charm & mind control, immunity to physical harm aka immortal, transformation into mist or creature etc.
In many high fantasy fiction the high tier vampire also no have physical form and\or won't appear in their true physical body form one, so to kill them ish have to find their hidden real body\corpse else even the stick through heart method ish won't be able to kill them.
vampyres get moar chiobus
Caipng sellers stronger.
They got choppers made with silver n whole body smell of garlic.

Will you take the job if your pay is 50% more?
piak first think later 
I took a part time 20h per week wfh job that pays 70-80% of my previous full time 45h salary.
I busy doing 2 other business and my life is so happy now.
No I don't work with any sinkie.
I work with americans and prc sibei song
hws they pays chius?
four or five figures?
depends on which company & team
If you are the only remote sinkie in the job role, all your colleagues are in US, then how?
According to sinkie, more money = more priority and respect tio bo?
So if gahment truly want to inculcate culture of giving up seat, why not charge higher fares to those who need them?
If they pay higher fare, regular sinkie confirm obligated to give up seats for them mah.
Tiagong now benchmark is at least a $1.

Yes, similar to PAP is not Singapore, KMT and DPP are not ROC.

not all mee rebus are made the same, if u know u know.
once me bought this mee rebus to dabao, thinkin' to just get my crave & nothin' much else.
nothin' wrong w/ the taste of the gravy but the texture is like way gooey, as if it's like that 10/20 cents glue that we used in nursery or pri sch time, u know the one in a small round tube (multi colored) where attached on its lid is the mini spoon to scoop the glue out.
that gooey albeit edible 
hahaha less ppl know da better
ur reply above is way off from my question asked 
This thread really making me hungry!
So far can't find.
Tis is wat moi heard too.
No juz tao cheo, peanut.

thot got some history or funny incident abt BTP that me have no idea of  .
anw BTP how big niaa .
 can say quite easy to narrow it down  
yes, though rare.
it's already listed by one of the posts above @ 409 AMK.
yes, in my neighborhood, there's one uncle sim who sells mee rebus .
residents in this estate all know him and say his mee rebus is kyky
i love the mee rebus at old tanjong pagar railway station.
coming to a decade liao, seldom jiak cos can't find anything close to it .
sometimes got craving den i will go P&Z at geylang rd, their mee rebus also not bad
feel like me am dead set on a bowl right nao!
why are all the good food  stalls located way out of my zone?
AMK 409 is best mee rebus.
Best Malay one is after lor 3 Geylang along main road.
This guy is just trying to act cute with his replies.
The stall at Our Tampines Hub just up their price to from $3.
50 to $4 for mee rebus, mee siam and lontong.
 With 10% KPT card discount it is $3.
60 which I still find it to be expensive for noodle, gravy and egg.
The best is the one nearest to you.
Not worth traveling more than 2km for mee rebus.
The real deal used to be the stall at basement food court of parkway parade.
Big portion & yummy.
just different ppl here will type in their own way
I say before liao, it's vb, not lw.
PAP might beautify data, but one thing they will not do is to lie about such thing.
So I do believe him if he says it's not him.
But if it's proven it's really him, then my belief above will no longer hold.
ask VB directly lah.
Dex Wong failed to ask the obvious follow up question.
Then minister LW, can you tell us who was it who said that?
I assure you … first line already give away liaoz… what a liar… no means no… short and sweet…
Den sld ask him what does he thinks of such person that gives such comment?
let's all go the bdsm way      
And PAPship kopes.
VB must apologise to Rafflesians then.
VB say knn already say it's him it's him it's him.
How many times you want him to eat dead cat ?
Monk's Hill is tsl.
The one who started with "illiterate" cfm is vivi.
No doubt, character is permanent.
But there is still other voices.
so now vb ish holding something of lw.
ccs shld nose house to pray this game
That dex wong did not ask LW who did make the comment?
i recall someone got away with the polling station rule by having a certain entity issued statement about perimeter of the polling station.
so magic can happen.
Wong asking Wong 
Whoever made the comment does not matter unless it came from the mouth of the person heading Ministry of Education.
The rule dun cover teleportation lah 
if all said is true, it seems 7th month already alots of absurd things happened.
Even on Parliament, mics suddenly turn 'hot', minister's mind wonder 'back to the future' in Sec schools, even  talk to themselves.
Anyone here or it is normal if someone had 'habit of self-talk' ?
(because i don't).
Does miw need to see by IMH?
Contract end, company cannot afford to renew such expensive contract.

All these so called expat talents are a drain of good money.

Don’t go back ever again to work
Correct rental alone is 18/2k.
Wah, rooks rike she can't wait for herself & family to experience Omicron sia .
And then what kind of expat ish this sia.
Most likely she took up another jod within the organisation which requires her to be at NY.
Then dun conveniently say pack your bags for NY mah.
Sibei ungrateful sia this am.
Gave her family free vaccine, kept them safe this is what Sg gets in return.
See my other thread comment on same topic.
In New York crime rate is VERY HIGH.
Chances of her or her hubby getting shot is much more likely in New York.
Cost of living in New York is even higher than in SG.
So this article is NOT telling the truth.
They are moving for other unspoken reasons.
Mask wearing and group number limits in SG are insignificant matters.
NYC property prices make us look like Manila
Not even counting tax rates in US and NY and NYC.
City public schools are also shiteholes in NYC.
need to go private schs
Happy getting Omicron in the US
You wont be missed.
Thank you for leaving.
please dont even com ehere again
It's always been like this.
Now, for THAT "other group" of foreigners, better if they move to United States to make their home and pursue their pot of gold.
Can someone tell me HR need what special expertise that cannot be found in local?
Bye, and don't come back.
Hope you step on lego on your way out and kena hoot by BLM when you reach NYC.

Why those cruise operators never build those big wooden ships that exists in the 18th century for us to go on board for cruise.
I think it will be more interesting to go for cruise on wooden ships than modern metal ships

More like thoroughly investigate ps  
Meanwhile the ivan the terrible case no sound no sight?
is a gift that keeps on giving.
 To the PAP that is.
One of those recommendations will likely include vetting of potential candidates by an "independent panel" on eligibility to stand as a candidate.
That will likely rule out LMW, LT  you name it and be like the PE going forward.
This is my guess.
What is the point of all that drama if you do not milk maximum political currency from it?
Slaughter one as a warning
Pinky panties so wet in 2022.
Can fix WP, can pawn sinkies
pls continue to fix WP and waste taxpayer monies
In b4 mass sympathy for miw

DO WE NEED TO FORM A COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY TO INVESTIGATE THOSE COMMENTS?
Bros, it so clear cut three million dollars salaried Ministers were having a bro-gossip chit-chat caught by hot MiC in Parliament on live TV.
Cannot be just one senile ViViZeh ownself talk to ownself, one pax monologue tioh boh?
Fact that ViVi ask "how did he get into RI?
" showed ViVi already think RI is a good school and Ah Leong Shu Shu's unworthy to get into that good school called RI.
So he will not say that it is a lousy school liaoz.
Minister A: "Seriously, how did he get into RI?
Minister B: "Must have been a lousy school.
Minister C: "I'm from Monk's Hill.
Online voice recorder.
Vocaroo is a quick and easy way to share voice messages over the interwebs.

Could be Dr Cheeeeee on the speaker phone.
They were on a live call
Is he really from RI and lousy sch same pax?
Good to know it's not him.
Afterall, he was the previous minister for education.
Hope the real commenter can come out and apologise too
KNN LAH why reporter never ask him "IF NOT U, THEN WHO?
LW is not stupid enough to leave a written note to contradict himself later.
LW: "CHARACTER MEANS HAVING INTEGRITY, HAVING HONESTY.
Looks like the conversation is between Vivi & Tsl.
This shows the credibility and integrity of PAP style and their IBs.
You die your own problem(Talking about V coming to own up) Everything will be pushed to the person who died.
You noticed those IBs taking a really similar approach as supporting what that 2 face guy is saying.
saying it's only 1 person.
It's so simple.
That guy has been doing videos on social media, interviews and so on.
Just have the balls to read out "must have been from a lousy school" and let everyone hear and judge if it's really not him.
Just listen to LW's speech.
It's his way of speaking.
Subconsciously, LW have a tendency, when pronouncing 2 syllabus words to make it particularly clear(2 sound) compared to V.
Again like what i've said earlier, go listen to the audio again for 10x.
Disclaimer: i used to support and like LW for the way he's been handling the covid situation.
Until this incident.
The latest comment that he made to say that he didn't say that, it really disgust me to the max.
Will VB admit he made the lousy remark.
The interviewer never admit " if not you.
Why keep quiet when the ground point finger at you?
Mai spread fear hor.
the CS, institution all the same.
Juz different group leading.
New broom sweeps clean.
all cleared up, LW for PM .
Dare to do, not man enough to admit
Let these ppl be sia.
As I said, sibei ungrateful liao.

Committee of Privileges will present findings on Raeesah Khan case 'in due course': Tan Chuan Jin​.
Raeesah Khan testifies before the Committee of Privileges on Dec 3, 2021.
SINGAPORE: The Committee of Privileges has “looked at” the formal complaint against former Workers’ Party Member of Parliament (MP) Raeesah Khan’s breach of parliamentary privilege and “will be presenting (its) findings and recommendations to Parliament through (its) report in due course”.
In a blog entry posted on the Parliament website on Monday (Jan 3), Speaker of the House Tan Chuan Jin said the Committee of Privileges “will thoroughly investigate the complaint to uphold the sanctity and integrity of parliamentary privilege”.
“The recent complaint that we looked at – and for which we will be presenting our findings and recommendations to Parliament through our Report in due course – is an important reminder that MPs must not wilfully abuse the immunity and privileges being an MP accords them,” he said.
Ms Khan, formerly an MP for Sengkang GRC, resigned in November after she admitted to lying in Parliament about a sexual assault case, which she had claimed was mishandled by the police.
She was referred to the committee for breach of parliamentary privilege after her confession.
Mr Tan said in his blog that all MPs enjoy parliamentary privilege, which gives them immunity from prosecution and civil lawsuits for the statements they make in the Chamber so that they may speak freely on matters and issues.
“Nonetheless, the onus also lies with every MP to apply due diligence and responsibility even as we exercise this privilege.
Statements made must be based on facts or well-substantiated information,” he said.
“The Committee of Privileges thus takes any formal complaint about breaches of Privilege seriously, and I, as the Speaker of Parliament, am the Chair of this SSC (Standing Select Committee).
The committee has released special reports to Parliament, summarising the key points from evidence given by Ms Khan, as well as involved parties including the leaders of the Workers’ Party.

Now it's time for the prosecutor to turn judge, to pass the verdict.
Cut off the bitxch and move on
They noticed whole country laughing at Edwin is it?
What’s the point of the findings from a group of pple acting as judge, jury and executioner all roll into one?
PAPship sure kope cos TCJ.
This type machiam one way traffic nia, need simi popcorn 
You mean those stuff discussed in the World Economic Forum?
Stuff like "Fourth Industrial Revolution" and "The Great Reset"?
is TS hinting at Chai-na world dominacion?
Yes, but or maybe more than that?
China rise to power and then EU got more to gain with a powerful China.
India and SEA will get suppressed by China.
Then our guys go China to work as construction workers and women go there to work as maids.
only China can save us now~ 
The world order will not change so easily.
The greys aliens had designed and controlled this order for many centuries.
Unless the lizards aliens gain influence.
Save us from them?
They've been salivating at us like a wolf staring at a sheep
"If you were to summarize the march of physics over the last 10,000 years, it would be the distillation of the laws of nature into four fundamental forces.
 Gravity, electricity and magnetism, and the two nuclear forces.
Newton's law unleashed the Industrial Revolution.
Faraday’s law unleashed the second great industrial revolution.
The next source of energy nuclear fission or Dark energy will unleash the next revolution.
Actually I'm personally a believer of nuclear fission too.
Can't imagine if everything's nuclear powered in future.
you have nuclear science knowledge?
lol believer in nuclear fission
actually what is there to suppress when countries changed their side to china.
big bro will not have the whole globe.
they will have to share half of the globe with tiong.
big bro cannot suka suka start war like in the past they did it to middle east.
as for sinkapore, familee prefer to stand leader together with big bro than under ccp with same skin color.
That's how nuclear power is generated these days what.
I'm not racist.
I don't regard China as my motherland.
The Chinese in China are not the same as those in Taiwan or Malaysia or Singapore.
don't worry, i worry more about pinky's era -old/undead lee era
This is the retribution for anyhow insulting people.
Do you know people scold you is for your own good.
Scold somemore lah.
I also join in and anyhow scold people.
Some say nuclear fusion is the holy grail.
Fission is unclean and produce radioactive waste.
anyway, the point is, industrial revolution is powered by energy.
Imagine mankind will be able to travel to distant galaxies etc.
That's why I keep emphasising we need to invent unlimited clean energy to improve lives.
First, it will prevent pollution.
Second, more kind of tech will be able to research and improve.
Third, cost of living will be reduced.
There ish only two new world order that earthlings need to fear.
The CCP world order and the Wrath of mother earth world order.
Both will lead to the demise of entire modern human civilization.
Actually I don't believe that the 'new world order' that we commonly referred to got any relation to CCP.
The commonly known 'New world order' if come to light, more like is a plan that is administered by various countries together.
let them enjoy la.
since so fk up policies.
Later they make noise again
You seem like a very righteous person.
Maybe from 22 July to 18 August, you should go out and catch all those offenders and report them to the authorities.
Maybe you get National Day medal for it.
pls let ppl have their moment.
i am sure they know what is right and wrong unlike those ktv guys.
So early one meh?
I always thought they mostly do night visit?
I think it’s more about being socially responsible I guess.
preese dun be lacist  
Why never baotoh those watch ndp celebrations?
CB TS, can don't attack fellow sinkies or not?
Better don’t stir them
Faster report them!
TS must be ceca.
Because those are multi racial pax?
Ts only aiming malay?

anyway not much diff lah unless got go ktv lah.
later glass heart broken anyhow post people call mata to catch no good lah
let ppl enjoy their festival la.

gg tml headrines daijiduadiao all the white and black dogs bark lacist again
Ok leh, my malay neighbours didn't even go out.
What shiat you stirring?
Hope you get CSI out.
what if they later engineer the recording to prove that it wasn't LW voice and say that audio taken over the internet is not reliable.
i tried to pin the voice on vb.
but it's very hard to imagine vb saying 'lousy' with equal emphasis on the 'zee' sound.
Now u know who is the real power hungry one.
How come suddenly got audio leaks on CCS.
Why someone always like to run to centre stage during covid.
Who is throwing OYK under the bus right now.
OYK is never in the PM race, his portfolio is always side tracked away from the PM route.
the oleeginal already spread all over the internet, now too late to do hand-leg anymore
Dont think its him.
So obvious it's LW who said it.
But still got kumgongs who think otherwise.
Then why as a Minister, he did not correct the person who made this comment?
He agree not all schools are good, some are lilousy?
if its MIW and people like that Sham asking, will still press on and force an answer out whether he agrees with the comment or not even if he says he did not make it
It’s obviously the voice is LW but if he dare to say it publicly it’s not him then we just have to suck it up
Looks like the 3G got to hang around longer liao
Hmmm, not LW then who.
No one admitted .
Parliament must be haunted
Who's school is lousier?
The one that didn't taught integrity?
also sounded like LW to me, but since he publicly say not him and we also cannot prove it's him, then it's between him and vivian to settle liao
Vivi bala alr tank the damage for monks hill and lousy school
Quite scary if its confirmed to be him and  he can still nonchalantly  deny he said it.
Definitely is him lo.
See he turned his head towards his right at the same time saying those remarks when TSL just seated down.
Really a pinocchio.
Maybe he overheard the private comments and just turned his head.
 The comment so rude and loud.
 If I was there, I would also turn my head to give Vv the (tsk) look.
I listened to the audio.
 Sounded like from the same person.
 But I not CSI or audio expert.
Maybe someone can zoom in the video to see whether his mask got move move a bit.
 He’s wearing the normal cheap surgical mask.
 Talk talk can see a bit of movement.
Some say always jiak jap bentos don't make u obese like cai png.
But price diff is big Sia.
Bento quality, cai png ish quantity.
See which one u prefer and feel more worth
Bento package look nice.
Caipng uses Styrofoam box.
Bento, all the different dishes are separated in compartments, taste not mixed.
Caipng all throw together, mix until like pig feed, very low ses.
you use bento tray to tabao cai png = bento
Difference is some can afford jap bento.
Some only can eat cai png.
Some ask mother to cook and leech off the food.
Price big difference
just like fu cking an atb is vastly different from fu cking a nipponbu.
bibimbap oso low ses, how come so expensive?
should price it the same as cai png.
Cai png more rice than bento.
Nasi padang more rice than bento.
But nasi padang and cai png same same different dish selection
cai png + short grain rice = bento
low ses moi ish can jiak whatever thrown to moi, beggar cannot choose
sounds like food court jap bentos.
cai png is life
Which one more nice to jiak
Cai png - Easy, no fuss packaging.
Integrated Dishes for a wholesome experience in dining.
Bento - Compartmentalized Dining to taste different dishes at their own peak.
end joy the same.
My fren who always go jpn says their train bentos are one of the finest food.
As it goes, anything foreign is more expensive.
Bibimbap is fixed ingredients, all the texture and taste is harmonized when eaten together.
Caipng curry mix with tomato sauce mix with soy sauce, all stir together is like rubbish.
Caipng if different dish served in separate bowls will be nicer, like some peranakan dinner set.

I 32yo still never hold gerl hand before   
Why worry, a lot of time.
If pandemic becomes worse, maybe chiu will be the last male on earth n can hv all the females.
that’s what I told myself when I was 18, 20 and 22  .
Mai Kia…xx age only…but the older I get the more Jialat I feel
Get a life first, I am serious.
Girls will come when you have one.
If u are desperate chances are u wil land up with someone you hv doubts abt later.
You should feel happy about it.
Most likely me at 32 
I see my friends, got 2 couple married, got BTO and kid already 2-3yi le 
If you keep living life worrying like its gonna run out, you will never fully enjoy life.

You won't be missed.
KNN they had it easy here already and still want to leave.
Leave just quietly leave.
Obviously has ill intentions by making this a statement.
Very worried for sinkies.
When they leave good jobs will disappear and we will become a fishing viklage
very very very easy.
3x easier then sinkie.
Blame on spore high density population by our leaders.
We can nvr be fully open.
Once fully open.
Our cases will be devastating.
I already foresee wfh and measures  till 2023 at least.
Tourism is crippled for sure.
To her, just quickly pack ip and leave spore.
Please dont be NATO.
Good hope her position taken over by sinkie
Not only that, they want to takeover and make you and your kids dalit

Fore play only.
Main dish haven't served yet.
When gst up 5%, they up 25%.
Now 2% and they up 15%.
My math failed.
that lau ban tau huey zui price up 20c from $1.
They are going with the flow
This up is due to COVID-19.
In fact most prices has been going up since the start of the 2021, just that recently announced GST, ppl take noticed and thought it's due to GST
Test test balloon first
Price now increased for CNY.
GST will increase again 
Food all these small things la.
Most impt is merc bmw audi Rolex PP RM got increase bo?
The ban mian I ate yesterday increased by 50 cents 
the price rise is due to inflation, not GST.
Wait later increase GST, the price will rise again
when actually up 9% they will up again.
My regular pancakes up 10 cents, hawker told me before LNY will be another round, siao.
my regular cai png stall every vege dish up 10c.
every meat up 20c.
Give how many CDC vouchers also no use loh
Best part 2nd round  increase price after GST announced
Its every year practice.
You never notice?
Highest tio is 50cents 
i only fear the virus mutates and make those infected crave for human flesh or blood.
who told u China is ur motherland.
the voices in ur head?
It's the illuminati
China will resist the New World Order 
The illuminati card game by Steve Jackson released in 1994 have many cards depicting a New World Order.
I more into the anti-matter particles
To truly progress to a Kardashev Type 1 civ (world-city; able to harness energy on a planetary scale), it would take a literal new world order to do so.
More than just an anemic and toothless UN.
There are many things that we are already capable of, just lacking the collective political will to carry it through and advance ourselves.
That's why for most of our history, such advances only come through after huge bouts of war and/or pandemic.
To be forced into action, so to speak.
New World Order is not scary.
but the scary thought is how many people need to die before that happen.
New world order?
The leader tiagong is hulk hogan
so new world order can do wat
Simpsons got talk about this?
new world order means what 
we need keanu reeves
Where can buy this card game ah?
I curious what other events they 'predicted'.

It’s easier if u can tap the screen
I wonder is it a patent thing.
But even mewatch has that and dunno why safari and chrome don’t have it
Real men jitao drag it to wherever u like timeline.
Eh, mobile browser or desktop?
Mobile chrome I can do double tap ah.
Desktop just press forward and back key on keyboard
Mobile can meh?
My iPhone double tap is zoom in only
Oh, android mobile browser can
He is a fresh graduate.
Deployed him to tag along with a non-graduate technician supervisor for on the job training with a team of technicians, do some technical work to understand the nature of the work and challenges we face so that when he is leading the team he knows how to respond and have better working synergy with the technical team.
After a month, he tendered his resignation and refused to share the reason for his departure other than he has found a better offer.
I suspect he is strawberry, unable to handle the work environment and his colleagues.
KNN, the company employed him for one month and the company Is willing to overpay him, to train him for a couple of months and he left only after a month.
Most likely he left this job for an air-conditioned office job.
Where to find Engineers who are willing to sweat under the hot sun and manage rough employee?
My boss just texted me to seek for overseas Engineers to fill this position.
Civil, mech , electrical, chemical or marine?
Why didnt employ lao jiao
Mechanical, refrigeration system.
The supervisor is a very lao jiao.
You pay him how much?
He is a fresh graduate, $3.
the supervisor is the TO?
maybe he give the young engineer problem behind the scene?
Kor kor chiu got internship ma can offer moi
He is on a 5 days week.
he opt to do food delivery?
own target own time no boss to report to?
Ceca gonna take over the position soon.
KNN become KKN.
No wonder your junior engineer left.
What is wrong with going for a better job?
What job is it anywhere?
I fine the TO is okay.
He may be rough, stern, spews vulgarities but otherwise willing to teach.
He knows that this chap will be his direct supervisor in a few months time, doubt he dares to give him problems.
There's always two sides to a story.
Think about it, if the job pays decently well, good environment and good co-workers, why would anyone leave?
My current job has met all those criteria, some days have to work unpaid overtime too but I'm not leaving because pay is decent and if I change job, no one can guarantee that I will get the same good co-workers that I have now.
5k consperm alot of fresh grad will cum snatch
not everyone  can or willing to handle rough employees.
in the 1st place why hire rough employees?
I think u r better off in employing experienced diploma holder for 3.
do u really need uni grad to lead the team, if the diploma holder can write basic reports?
Just a thought.
Is it the supervisor didn't treat him well?
Now they good business?
Seems that many people keep borrowing these days
oh you bet it is!
Good business huh?
My block also got someone borrowing money.
Got lady in hot pants accompanied by 2 hunky bodyguards with tattoos every Sunday morning.
All 3 wearing staki lanyard with photocard and carry files.
If the debtor chao kuan and mai pay up, they also llst right?
Not like they can hoot the guy or hang pig head
those agency got work on weekends one meh?
the debtor confirm feel xia suay one pls!
so much noise and the neighbor confirm wondering why
maybe u see wrongly.
those guys are her pimp
The hunky bodyguard got wear jacket behind saying big big "Debt Collection in Progress.
Not just about borrowing money leh.
Business buy goods already don't want to pay up.
Or car/reno companies take money never deliver,etc.
Lots of people need to use debt recovery services.
you win court case and court awards you the money.
If the other party don't pay, you still need to engage your own either lawyer or debt recovery to get the money.
They are NotWhatYouThink
Huh, like this got use meh.
They go over and talk only.
The debtor can just say a few words and then ignore them right?
Where got incentive for debtor to pay anything.
The creditor now waste even more money as need to pay fees for debt collector also
Look like bouncers kor kor
I saw a rooster
Yes debtor can ignore them.
But they will just keep looking for debtor non stop lor.
Go house find, go workplace find.
It does seem most of the time, they are on, no collection no pay.
So they take a % of what they manage to collect.
Most of the time the creditor is no more moves left, then go look for debt collector.
If you follow priority list of payment by liquidator, all the small suppliers practically no chance of getting any share of the money.
Because the list prioritises the big boys, liquidator first, then the banks and landlords, utilities, then anything left then will go the suppliers.
Basically the priority is skewed towards the big boys.
Those that can take the hits are given money first ironically.
Those that cannot take the hit are taking the biggest hits.
And you wonder why they are unwilling to wait for liquidators to come in.
Some ppl would give in to pressure because they have no where else to move to.
just need to look tough and flex muscle nia.
i bet they can't handle Garie.
She got 1 very nice CNY song.
some u use jap bento box but the quality is cannot
if you rich af you prefer jiu hu bu or jpmm?
i think real jap bento is v diff from wat we have in sg which is localized.
a lot of time we buy are piping hot.
in jap bento r cold, most ppl also dont heat up, just eat it like that and they also eat v little compared to us.
last time i was really excited to go jap eat their bento, must say look is v nice but we are more used to our caipng style of warm, strong smelling food.
atb more supply and higher mileage whereas nippon-bu more kc.
ish about the journey, not just the destination.
These are disgusting, some of them can really cheapen the food by cutting corners and serving crap.
Ingredients not fresh, deep fried dripping in old oil, some diluted curry with round grains that's not even japanese rice and they think they can call that japanese food.
I miss the bentos you get in Taiwan at the train stations.
Cheap and good, and the quality is quite high too, for the cheap price.
no ish more rike piak a jiuhu bu vs jippun bu.
jiuhu bu is no fuss integrated experience from massage to piak.
jippun bu, got menu one.
You must pick before hand which to experience and they do 1 by 1.
Obviously you neber go soapland in Shinjuku before.
Not expert but think more original jp food often is more than just the food itself bah.
The pricing tend goes into the presentation, ingredients, and brand perhaps.
Food court bento is scam.
Especially those sell both ‘Japanese’ and ‘Korean’.
Just fried food and sauce.
jap bento make u light but only wallet wise.
got woo before?
They would divorce very soon so you should be happy about it.

I am 32 years old BBFA - I never had a gf before, super dry season for me, I am sahara desert riao.
Trust me, you got to be brave, most importantly, you got to care enough to find a gf.
You don't want to end up a loser like me.
32 year old, no wet hole, stay home eat polo.
You go out there right now, see chiobu, hoot, use mouth not use hands arh.
Get reject a hundred time, get reject enough you will get a gf eventually.
why are you comparing yourself with other people?
you all have diff personality, character, family upbringing, values, mindset.
23 nia complain no gf
u try dating apps bah.
ish still got good girl if u dont set expectations too high.
need some time to find.
In life, there is only 1 true love.
Have…3 in total.
One was a gold digger…to the point that it was my friend who made me see what I have become (basically an unlimited ATM for her), one was cos I didn’t confess and she went for my friend and third the girl got bored 
i am a 26 yo bbfa ok
I tried Tantan, OkCupid, tinder, CMB….
got tired of it and very few matches 
this is so true, ah gui biggest regret is never chase girls hard enough while in school
heng moi know love ish but an illusion.
23 only kaopeh so much for f?
Government thinks you still have 12 more years before expiry.
why didnt u confess   .
sometimes just need to have the guts to say how u feel  
continue to try better than giving up, giving up is totally no chance.
since u wan a relationship.
u wols liao, some coffee shop up the prices of their drinks late last year .
our usual coffee and tea from $2.
Portion also smaller liao
Nowadays i decide to eat sandwich from petrol kiosk.
Boycott hawker food
the hot mike problem la.
maybe VB saying: RI is a good school .
at the same time, LW saying: my nasi lemak just now damn lousy.
so happen the mike capture the words: lousy and school consecutively lah, so sounds like lousy school
Why did the Speaker of Parleenent not get to the bottom of it?
Identify all that was in the conversation besides Ms Vivian?
Can't be Ms Vivian uttering it to Mr Vivian right?
if do, need to send him to IMH for checkup.
Since the remarks were made in parleement, should apologise in parleement.
Mic was on and recorded, considered as part of parleement speech.
I'm dead sure if the remark was made by opposition MPs, confirmed all in it will be identified.
Sure big case till they cannot get away with just a simple apology.
Vivian admitted his portion of remarks with LMW as the latter posted on his FB and at same time queried who said the rest.
Tsl only quipped his monk's hill portion.
You say lei,no need to think so hard.
If Vivian said everything he wld have further clarified with LMW and LMW wld have provided an update.
he took a deep breath before turning his head.
looks like can see a bit of mouth movement as the words spoken but video too pixelated to confirm.
Based on his personality as seen on tv and other social media,there is no telling such remarks cannot be associated with him Just ytd he labelled the 2 psp ncmp as .
Come GE 2025 the video/audio clip will come back to haunt him.
he is free to say what he likes and deny everything 
Bro, diam diam no admit is one thing….
But now ish go next level double down to make FB post black and white on Leecord to say not him leh….
Just like COVID no horsepeter beds never mind.
But steel no CB or HA to break transmission and double open up for FTs to fly in fly out to worsen the problem…
Pretty obvious they have discussed and one should take one for the team.
The most dispensible.
He very confident no one can find out who the other person is?
Speaker of Parliament juz sweep under the carpet liao although the public has the interest to confirm whether it was VB talking to himself since LW denied.
If LMW made the illiterate remark, we can imagine he being asked for evidence of illiteracy , then he oso need to apologize to RI, get big persecution liao.
Clown Chun Sing sit so far away from rest of the leeders means what?
not me, not you, not him.
then must be ghost.
Yah Vivian ownself talk to ownself in parliament is really sth wrong leh.
He so stress huh?
If at home or alone still can understand.
A lot of people try to process thoughts and talk to oneself.
But in parliament?
I never believed Lawrence Wong said lousy school.
Those who wronged him should apologise
Monk's hill confiirm is TSL.
But 1st and 2nd sounds like VB to me.
Rhetorically, 1st and 2nd possible to be said consecutively .
If LW said he is not the one, then most likely to be VB.
If this is the case, why can't VB just admit that he is the one since he already apologize.
The lack of clarification makes it natural for people to guess and take sides.
It is really unfair to LW if he is not the one.
The Speaker should also raise this matter up to stop another embarrassing episode from happening in future.
We need world class debates in parliament, not coffee shop talks.
Everyone has to watch what he or she speaks/behaiour in Parliament, be it Mike on or not.
This is the minimum expectation of any representation of the electorate.
Cannot be ViVi senile ownself ask question ownself Leeply ownself de….
these ppl also assured sinkies that we are their priority at every election.
assurance is a feeling, not a fact.

oh btw LTC Food Taster here haha
Airline captains leh.
This is just their past time business to get together and mingle with MILFs and charbors while waiting for sky reopening.
I bet their management are hardly affected.
Work horse always suffer.
If they know someone who knows someone, then it's easy to get in durian directly from plantation owners .
Durain profit ard 50% prob more huat than flying once they secure enough customers.
Earn more and more time on the ground with family.
My friend is SIA pilot, still receiving most of his basic pay despite not working much for more than a year
Not going to support buy from them.
they must be malaysian lo and have plantation back in their malaisia
They are smarter than those useless ones who work as social distancing ambassador .
Sell durian can earn gao gao like aeroplane captains.
lip lai share share 
Too big not used to it.
Must sit beli far away  
20" longer than moi kkj
wow why need two?
Limbei ish 80 inch long.
About 6 inches.
It's good enough to pleasure my wife.

I dun like to alt tab go out
50" 4k tv as pc monitor .
Not so sure should change to 32 inch next time.
Big screen is better for my lao hua.

23 inch 1080p  swee swee
Those using tv rike siao lang 
not using monitor at home
2x 27 inch monitors
I misread the title as "how big is your mother?
My monitor is Philips 17", that time SLS got promo, so i hoot.
too heavy to carry to Bugis MRT, need to sit teksi home.
Very nice still must take teksi 
27 inch for home iMac.
Now WFH with office laptop, it's hooked up to a 40 inch tv.
Has been around since George Bush JR time lah.
Why specifically only little bush time leh?
But I don't think this is possible within the next 100 years or more.
The Chinese in Singapore are also not the same as those from Malaysia or Taiwan.
You tried speaking English to an educated Malaysian Chinese before?
Can vomit blood.
People from China
Yeah, we are definitely different due to our nationalities.
That pretty much changes our upbringing and beliefs.
When I see Malaysian Chinese, I would ask if they studied in a Chinese medium school or BM medium school.
They can be very different in their world views.
after covid most normal way of economics and industrial practices will go out of the window.
that, is a fact we all cannot deny, WFH already happened, office space will no longer be as valuable.
Robotics revolution coming right up (drone food delivery / automated grab services anyone?
i can count at least 5 definitely came in to real life
Yes alien is coming to setup new world order.
Used to be a fan of hulk hogan when I was young, until john cena came into the scene.
So, no to nwo.
looking forward to this
china is just a strawman.
the powers to be control the whole world including Nk and Iran.
satan rules this world.
be in this world but not of this world.
life will be very tough but there's nothing to be afraid of once you know the Truth.
Maybe but people who go full yolo and borrow money usually also very thick skin one, they might just insist on not returning
Those dc will do anything to disrupt your life.
Even you thick skin, you still need a job.
You can don’t return $$, but you still need $$ to live by.
Thats a lot of work for the dc without a guaranteed payout, also debtor can WFH, do other own business or even go overseas.
Not practical to hire dc to claw back tiny amount of money
Just need to apply for anti harassment protection order, these bengs cannot even come near u.
Well, that’s what they do for living.
My customer just go to court , pay couple of dollar, get a anti harassment order, no one can go near him.
Why the creditor cannot go down personally to chase himself, he got the right as well right?
If debtor don’t pay call police, get police report turn it into a civil case.
I think these DC can be a nuisance, especially those innocent neighbours and bystanders also kenna harress.
Hdb I see many of these type of cases.
Can’t hide anymore
owe money dun want pay the people will feel xia suay de meh
No one or that specific debt collection agency?
like that  can always engage other agency
Should change to other names like account recovery team.
 cut the curry pork hair wear tight fit office clothes ma
Quite lousy tbh.
those chaps don’t even have full sleeves tattoos.
like that go collect cash, who will return ?
if it’s me, I would just whack those mofos up.
ask his edmw name
Got higher pay still waiting for what?
Of course jump la.
Now you really think got loyalty to company one meh?
Fresh grad maybe tried to suggest an improved routine using iot, some IT controls then the lao jiao don't know north south east west and rejected.
How to lead a team like that in the future?
The company wasted so many months of salary keeping these low productivity workers.
aiya, might as well go to another company that is more progressive.
This is s REAL case i recently encountered in some training settings.
A lao jiao line manager (mechanical, process) jjww.
1st week cher tried to teach some CAD and he was struggling.
Tried to be a good classmate and wanted to help him, From CAD to do he don't understand, reduce level teach him what is points, edge, line, don't understand, okie, reduce level teach him how to create a folder to store his cad files, don't even know how to create a new folder.
Wah pianz, asked him er he do process?
Oh, he knows excel, everyday manage CNC, milling, etc proessing jobs and production control.
So how you do one?
Er, everyday got printout of excel timesheet, he takes hardcopy, Qty 3, go F the technican make qty 3, end of day tick checkbox.
Qty 5 only get 4?
Nabe like that technical manager?
Some of our seniors really IT challenge, cannot catch up with the moving industries liao or scared to change.
My company just hired new FT for 4500, what you offering
5k of cos run road la
Cut him some slack.
He may not have the character to handle and manage a team.
Some people are more suited in handling work alone by himself.
And he may not be a hands on guy in the 1st place.
i am in a similar position as ur engineer.
firstly to have a fresh grad with little experience to lead a team few months after on the job training is asking too much.
he is thinking ahead to the day he has to take over the job of the supervisor.
this is the problem with sg engineering scene, expect too much from engineers and split technical roles into technicians and engineer.
tbh, i find some technicians role are more suited to be paid engineering salary and engineering roles who are leading a team of technicians should be a senior technician like ur laojiao supervisor.
not just purely base on roles and titles.
Youngsters these days prefer jobs that are office bound with aircon.
They study so hard for degree already why bother to toil under sun or harsh conditions daily.
I am sure there were hundreds of qualified applicants and waiting to take his place.
Don't need to think so hard to give excuses for a poor hire choice or even attack the quitter.
Just assume they had a better offer and wish them the best.
Fresh graduate, zero experience.
When he was here we were paying for his on the job training.
Sinkies are rike dat one.
Due to lesser/zero new engineers from Myanmar/Phillipines/India recently.
The available pool of engineers in Singapore is Hot Property.
If can jump better jump now, and can demand higher salary.
I got one engineer in the company I worked in, quit end 2020.
Then last week I saw him visit, driving a brand new SMY Toyota Corolla.
Then he pass me his name card, senior technical engineer!
Previously he take the company transport to office.
After jumping ship, now he become better off.
Free internship can ma
Knn why you never wonder why this fresh grad will leave your job.
Your side toxic culture and people, many OT and lower than industry standard pay isit.
of course he found better pay of course hop lah.
u offer better pay if u want engineers to sweat under hot sun
Job hop means got job opportunities.
Find others liao
5K is too Low these days le.
Average should be $4k already.
And in case TS didn’t know.
Most fresh grad / uni grads are loaded with money , either from parents or from investing in stocks and crypto.
So what is that $3.
You say overpay.
Maybe to the employee is not enough?
like semi retirement mode liao.
everyday 9-6 is just online/ at office to show face.
those whose jod can wfh longterm one loh.
which is many of edmw.
dragonite zeh zeh

most of them long left edmw, some even married have children already.
there are no new mm for 2020.

Face it,  good majority of hardwarezone and facebook users are 30s-40s
Any chiobus still here at 2020?
All bbfas here need a chance 
this chio bu posted yet?
Wa kan silang chio sial.
Upz your points.
Heavy taste siah.
But no swimming pool.
And how you renovate, your neighbours would still be low ses hahahahha.
Actually, most condo residents also behave low ses  .
But at least the condo is more instagramable
I don't do instagram and I don't use the condo facilities (except maybe the gym, but then again I go to another gym).
I prefer the larger space since that's where I spend most of my time.
 Our jobs here is so unattractive to them ?
 Choice to work here can be easily overridden by a mask ?
Common lah when their own country dun even want them
I thought Only my dad's generation use yehudi.
now still many restrictions of course wanna leave lo
How come ppl can find job easily but sinkie just cannot get out.
All refer drv grab here.
More will come in from South Asia
Government already said we  not enough local talents so need come in more foreign talents.
So you expect us being no talented can find work elsewhere?
I sympathesize with the expats.
In their home countries, they can socialise freely, go to restaurants and bars in bigger groups, and even not wear masks.
Still, we cannot lift restrictions and let imported cases go out of control.
The only thing to do about the exit of FTs is to tap the local workforce.
He never get invited to the big expat party at Clarke quay over new year?
Maybe feel left out
CEC@ will leplace AMDK
jobs for FTs, NS for sinkies
Expats are foreigners with no roots and loyalty to this country?
Who would expect otherwise from them?
Or you are one of those Singaporeans who bought into the ministerial propaganda of sll FTs are playing for Team Singapore.
good good, 1 way ticket right?
what's the correlation here?
sorry bit what?
moi can only see big breast

i actually regretted even till today, my friend told me she was actually waiting for me to say but then I didn’t .
I think after that I became super edgy and as such, the third girl got bored of me .
girls seems so complex 
thats what my friend say as well…finding a wrong girl is worse than not having one at all.
A toxic rs sucks
leegret, what if eternal recurrence?
 I am BBFA I have no leegret because I don't give a f*ck since 1989.
There is only like 1 woman so far, that made me want to look at her instagram.
I just don't know how to care about woman at this age.
what is the ideal age to have gf?
bro, i also lah,  what to do.
no luck means no luck.
i totally know how u feel
TS, love and marriage is not a race.
This is something young people like you need to learn.
Yes, you are envious others can buy BTO and "get rich".
Unker me is in a gc with 200+ divorced / unhappy people in marriages.
When you have a child and have to live with someone you once loved and now hate, that's when the nightmare begins.
Take your time.
Love and marriage is to be enjoyed.
More important to get it right.
Not re-marry 3 times.
Go find a sales job.
meet many different ppl.
do well earn alot of money your syt colleagues also come to you ask you for advice
no need to regret.
the more times chiu failed.
the more sianz and jaded chiu get.
thank you sir…I hope I can find the one soon bah.
I know that a rs is not all roses but then it sucks seeing how loving some of my friends are 
can ask ur friends to intro u laa .
if u are someone of a gd character, am sure ur so-called friends could put a gd word about urself to the gals that they knew of.
even to intro their gfs'/wives' female friends if need be.
but gotta ask urself this 1st: whether if u are ready to commit urself in a r/s for a lifetime
When he 38 the other people you referring to become 51 liao
i also sian, every day thinking maybe i can go Bedok reservoir for a swim.
but I still pressed on brother.
and look forward to my life and hope that something good happens.
i know how it feels.
my friends are mostly guys lo…don’t really have much female friends 
tnats what I told myself at 20 as well.
ts wat u been through everyone also experienced same thing.
everyone also got experienced before
the older chiu get.
the more sianz chiu get.
and more and more chiu will come to terms with it and chiu will be quite hokayz with staying single riaoz.
by then they wouldve matured like wine and all the syts begging to be their stead liao
just deliver the kkj will do
limited to non kkj customers only
I think they need to hire real full-time delivery guys for food delivery, with incentive for performance.
If performance don't meet kpi, then fire.
It sounds better on resume if you learn how 160 rephrase it.

He's quite big.
but we are not into body-shaming.
A couple of prefects are bigger than him, but the assistant, a monitress, is rather petite.
find 27inch too big
Sick of people using China as the bogeyman.
China even if double or triple their current strength cannot fight the whole world.
Both Napoleon and Hitler found out the hard way, i am sure Xi wont make the same mistake.
The world at 6 billion population closing in on 7 billion should worry about how to keep their mouths fed.
With climate getting worse every passing year, won't be long before we get a famine of epic proportions.
Maybe then a world war might even be a good thing, reduce the world population by a third.
If that dun do it, maybe another virus might do the trick.
No more Trump ma
that's human natural instinct to self regulate.
find some excuse to kill each other.
what's the new world order?
Who's the king
The new world order will be countries losing sovereignty.
Basically there will be no nationalism.
People will have free movement.
Probably a unified currency too.
The rich countries will be forced to support the poorer ones.
Basically the EU but  globally.
And we all saw how successful that is.
The smaller trial run failed but the geniuses believe if they extended it globally, this idea will succeed.
But who is the overall leader then?
faster reset lah
i just wanna go isekai nia 
I think globalization has gone amok and affected societies.
 The ordinary Joe have realized globalization only benefits big corporations, corrupt governments and the wealthy elite.
 Societies have paid the price in terms of economic outsourcing, wage depression and uncontrolled immigration waves.
In the end, I hope the oppressed citizens all over the developed world will eventually get fed up and revolt!
 This world really needs a drastic reset to put things back in order.
 Even if this results in anarchy, violence and destruction, it is worth the price to pay to address the corporate greed that has damaged livelihoods, distorted trade and polluted environments.
The conspiracy has been discussed since the old George Bush's times.
But here, the New World Order reality is CECA.
Kali projected onto building and shiva at cern might not be simple.
Someone from rome 
Rome is a tool.
Infiltrated and positioned to push for it.
The leader of the NWO will be from a superpower country.
Possibly the USA or China.
But if its the USA, the USA would be nothing like it is today.
And it's not someone the ppl elected.
Ish Hulk Hogan 
Is too big to be united.
If u do it by force, U hurt yourself more.
Human mindset changes  very fast, especially if it doesn't benefit them.
Let's simply ponder upon this point.
We need the disparity between the rich and the poor to make the world function.
huai never upload the 4k version to youtube?

Never see anyone talk about this here.
What printer do you use?
What do you print?
Cubicon Style, PLA/TPU.
Used to have envisiontec in my lab but decommissioned liao haha.
BBFAs here print customized vags.
I know an edmwer that has that hobby
I only hear 2 voices in that video clip.
I don't understand why some ppl insist that there were 3 ppl talking and LW was one of them.
Liang popo makes wo wo sound u cant tell
Pinky sit so near to them.
Why never come out clarify this issue?
he probably hears them every time.
only this time the mic was on.
He probably has been waiting for a long time for someone to ask the question so he can deny making that remark, and most importantly, tell others involved that he didn't 'gold finger' him/them.
 If i was him, I would probably get a stooge to post that question so I can answer it.
im notch an elite but its too big to coverup moreover miw is not a small company.
3 pax unker beer talk alr so low.
doubt he can survive whiter than white if he actually said it and double down to deny.
pluck out one by one.
Tan See Leng is from Monk's Hill.
Vivian B has admitted he said.
The 3rd person who said something about how LMW got into RI; must be sitting near the above 2 persons.
Go and  check the video of the telecast debate.
People say can tell from voice, but I cannot.
 Maybe I didn’t on loud enough or what.
But based on 2 things - his body language and his emotional bank account (EBA) , my judgement is it’s not him.
 He appeared to be minding his own business as if thinking “this loose cannon Viv just leave him alone”, and  from personal experience , others tend to leave such loose cannons alone because they will also turn on you.
 Then only when Tan replied with ‘I’m from Monk’s Hill”, did he turn.
likely because Tan just spoke and he felt what Tan had to say could probably be something to note i.
the earlier Viv self talk can be rubbished and I am not going to bother about him.
Now that he has clarified, I doubt he will lie because it would mean to Viv and Tan that he is willing to lie for such a seemingly trivial matter…though they are in same party, they are also sizing up each other.
LPP crying liao 
It seems obvious to me.
Can someone repeat to me the conversation again.
I want to analyse the content to see if the content and sequence can be spoken by the same person.
which means he is also too shrewd to admit.
Of course, no discreet minister would have uttered those disrespectful words had he known the mic was recording.
The Emperor Has No Clothes.
Meaning:​This expression is used to describe a situation in which people are afraid to criticize something or someone because the perceived wisdom of the masses is that the thing or person is good or important.
Agree, among them LW is the only one to i say well done.
you should reply him on his FB page: "I knew you wouldn't have said such disrespectful words.
The person who uttered those words and not owning up must have been a hypocrite without integrity!
yes, agree this is not a trivial issue since it involves the integrity of our ministers.
Not easy but anyone can do.
if u throw in one more slim atb or vietbu, im sure will be fun

Simple yes or no
Ownself stupid but blame others are the worst.
all the notices on their website all about changes to their interest rates and card promotions.
not even a warning on the scam and phishing.
Personal Banking Notices .
Definitely partial blame.
Nobody is faultless in this saga
imo def got part to play.
Fearful yes, stupid no.
scammers made use of acct holders fear to their advantage.
and its not like acct holders are responding to get rich quick scams
No machine learning AI to detect sudden unusual large transfer to foreign entity?
What a farking joke.
At least stop the transfer and get a service staff to manually call lah
How can let scammer take money out from the account holder?
Stupid jiu shi stupid simi fearful?
Both are at faults.
OCBC could have stopped it earlier.
MAS and banks could have strengthened the security protocols.
Yup that's why I said their fraud department is really cui.
The scams can go on for days?
Only Cheat Brainless Class.
Already withdraw everything from the bank.
User kum gong and OCBC system not robust enough.
Should have triggered something on their end
Go for the strongest bank.
One question do the banks hold physical cash?
Example if their total internet banking account is 1 trillion, everyday large volume of physical cash is transfer globally?
Still not able to trace where the money gone to?
All disappeared after transferred out?
All go hor-lan liao.
criminal can go there and will never be extradicted
I though shd be all ocbc fault?
Im shocked people here can blame the victims.
Scammer trf the money without otp notification triggered is their fault?
just hope your aged relatives dont fall victim cause you would be singing a diff tune then
Hope more follow in his footsteps
I don't mind being a hotel if that's the business model.
Singaporeans provide the services, manage and run the hotel business on our own, draw good management salaries and pick up valuable high level management skills.
But problem is all the high management jobs, good salary jobs and international business skills are given to foreigners while Singaporeans, even very qualified and educated ones are relegated to being chambermaids to serve FTs in their own  country.
thank you byebye
Why are we Singaporeans, highly educated and qualified in our country be second class residents to FTs hiring manager who hire and give out good jobs and opportunities among themselves within the FTs expats networks?
Why PM Lee like to put FTs on a pedestal while vilifying and condemning our our Singaporeans.
If running under the hot sun and humid rain for 8 to 10 hours a days doing physical manual labour to run around to deliver food and groceries to FTs working from home in their nice cushy condo is not proof of Singaporeans being able to take hardship and picky about jobs, I don't know what is.
It’s actually easier to find job there now, they experiencing the “great resignation” need as much talent and workers as they can get their hands on atm
This is why I don't trust government-controlled media.
Don't understand .
They run away for the most minor of issues.
So what's the big deal with them leaving?
C guys will come take their place.
good riddance to the leechers and Spandex warriors.
They already know the issue that's why trying to cheat on the case number to justify they can open further.
Yes that's right.
Singapore will end up like Monaco .
In Monaco being a millionaire is like someone staying in condominium in Singapore.
 It's just middle class .
They have tons of multi millionaires & billionaires .
And its the French residents who stay there who serve them.
So an entire economy is created to serve the rich .
Except in Singapore,  Singaporeans serve third world Indians
and stuck in endless infection of covid all variants, unfortunately; there is a good reason for mask wearing and social distancing .
and she can also bet her last dollar going down the road for many years to come, all major insurers are going to push every little medical problem she has to be vaccine related thus not claimable .
very simple, pak zham or not, as long you don't want to get covid any variant, you will need to mask up, raw is war.
for those who buy into covid is just a flu, omicron is even less than a flu thing, good luck
Give lame excuses .
Amurica so many job openings nao.
I received many email enquiries from head hunters n recruiters there
cheaper better faster.
most sinkies are peasants nia, who cares if they live true to their peasant nature by working as serfs?
And they voted in the same way, the first floodgates with the largest Tsunami wave was carried out by the father.
What stop u being a FT in other countries?
common occurrence acty, nthn' to be surprised or peeved at.
once hired, dun put any high hopes that the person will stay for a long time.
for whatever reason/s that he/she wanna leave, so be it .
up to that person anw
It’s very funny these days that corporates think their $3.
5k or $4k worth a lot and youngsters are willing to slave their life for that amount.
It’s an internet world where money is no longer earn from slogging their lives.
previous in my post already said sinkies are strawberries liao.
no 5k said celery low, no training provided say no carreer development.
now u see training provided liao wanna say wat?
chao sinkie deserve to do food deliver and driver lah.
u jas look for foreigners.
they more driven and positive altittude.
dun waste your time.
You can find foreigner then say.
Now I heard alot of their work permits keep getting rejected.
Got coys apply three times reject thrice .
there are plenty of abnn and pinoy applying.
My boss asked if we should cast our nets to overseas engineers.
Fresh grad from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia come here can get 4.
Good luck with your offer.
Remember what some minister said, one day sinkies will be FT in other countries or something like that.
What are the future job prospects in ur company?
Or will be stagnated after sometime?
Propsperous free market economy.
 You can always fire anyone,  and anyone can also fire you.
If  equilibirum is achieved, then both parties will engage in an agreement lor.
Obviously the junior didn't feel the equilibirum , no matter what you think/say about him is irrelevant.
The only way to have real Sinkies willing to take anything is when the whole economy tanks and sh*t hits the fan.
By then, even $2K everybody will be fighting for the job to serve you.
Solution - pay higher / learn how to motivate youngsters / wait for economy to tank / hire FT  (Choose one!
end of the day its just to keep depressing wages of enginners and yet expect alot of responsibilities from grads.
keep it up go ahead and employ ur third world engineers just because they are willing to work harder for that pathetic 3.
5k salary which u think is high in todays cost of living.
The fresh grad just have to throw all responsibility to the technician can already.
Have you see fresh grad lead a team on first day?
TS, are you saying sinkie buay kan?
Maybe here's the problem.
How many field teams and how many TOs you have?
In management training, we were advised to send management trainees to different teams for OJT training/orientation.
That is if a trainee is primed to manage Team A, he is sent to Team B for his OJT.
Indeed, there are numerous benefits in this practice.
A luxury you may not have if the outfit is small.
how much did your company paid him as a fresh grad?
MNC or  SME company ?
How many % of his time in non air con environment ?
TS working in Bedok?
This is a fresh graduate position and we have based our salaries on the median salaries of local University graduates.
Underpaying people again.
ok go back to your cheap nehs la.
low ses sme towkays
his position is the traineeship program ar?
no wonder jump ship.
He just found a job as construction worker.

Best part if your parents are conservatives, can't blame them though, the girl you dated sure kenna condemn by your parents

It's mda's fault if we cannot watch online gay sex

Not sure if this movie is still copyrighted material.
Guess you can do it yourself.
buy the app or go climb mountain.
I still remember this  got superman stand on roof.
the other nonsense song was YOG oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
sinkie budget in deficit to fund these jokers?
Samsung Smart TV's youtube search shows 4K icon for this video but still cannot select 4K playback.
Wonder why its taking so long for youtube to process 4K.
If they do an updated version, probably more than half of the rappers are ceca.
Guess why MDA has been renamed as IMDA now.
Youtube can 4K playback liao

Personal and professional ties must be kept Separate.
TCJ seem one of the trust worthy one.
Both tio fixed by u-noe- who
Yes, it was indeed Speaker of Parl Tan Chuan-Jin eating bak kut teh with WP chief Low Thia Khiang.
We could use more of this cohesion in Singapore.
This is very true.
colleague is colleague.
This was before or after his Speaker appointment?
Good to know TCJ was neutral on the COP.
I still feel that COP members should not be a ruling mps.
the essence of this pikcher ish the food.
must have been expensive.
PAPship loves this thread .
i guess we wont see ET doing that with PS
Politics - In front smiling, back stabbing?
I dont want to keep jabbing.
Pfizer still no 3rd trial data like sinovac?
The common flu vaccine is like every few years need to reconnect if you travelling to their world dirty countries.
Those vaccinated will be guinea pigs.
they are still new.
thus no one can answer
You WILL be jabbed anyway.
They already said liao, COVID is here to stay every year will refresh.
If suay, 3 days later got newer version making every single vaccine in the world useless.
Then back to square one.
Every year inject updated code
Like tat take traditional vaccines like J&J safer mah.
Half dead virus, body immune system can handle, new technology vaccines nobody knows
Flu vaccine is yearly leh.
How come yours every few years?
even they ish tell you few years.
few months or a year later si mi double mutant variant come out riaos.
But govt wants u to jab jab.
Otherwise how to open border quick quick?
Edmwers said no to vaccine.
means you jab early you lugi
you will be protected until you get infected with covid and fall sick 
My safety manager says it should be a 1 year thing.
27 inch monitor

old monitor but I love it
Do you rotate often?
Anything bigger for 1080p blurry imo .
Need to go for 1440p at least for 24".
14inch laptop extend to 32inch monitor.
plus 15inch laptop to surf edmw.
go back office feel 2 x 17inch weird and graphics cmi
just changed from CX48 to Prism x340 .
Is monitor worth it?
For reading long text.
same like on a tablet.
portrait is better to read long passages than landscape.
You set 2 display side by side with your laptop.
drag those content over to the monitor to read
48" TV as monitor
Wow are such monitor expensive?
I remember about $240 niah.
bought dell direct.
 but this is not for playing games or Photoshop quality works.
For extra screen real estate for reading.
and my eyes more comfy with these matt screen.
These are very common in offices.
one 27" and one 24" Vertical
3x27 on fixed stand and 2x24 on ergotron arm

Must be CIA blackhand trying to make caina orlumpig failure!
their country too big and too many people.
they got no choice.
once it becomes too jialat.
by then it will be a case of massive infection and death.
Once they report like that mean sibei jialat liew.

Remembering chiobu of pass Amulet jiejie.
Her last post in 2015 and last activity in Apr 2019.
Where is the xiong?
are these real edmwer bus?
Nobody can take over your throne.
Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.
I got the same picture on HDD with this name.
though really dunno who is it.
Google "EDMW Amulet" the first picture lor.
wearing white bikini.
but that was very long ago.
now I think you can wait for few more years for her daughter.
Busy with family life lar.
she got a young son to take care of in addition to her teenage daughter.
Mr Wong said the recent increase in the number of cases is not unexpected, since more people have been going out following the loosening of restrictions earlier,.
But Singapore is also in a new phase, with a high level of vaccine coverage, he added.
As the Government continues to monitor the situation, it will also expand the nation's vaccination and testing regime.
Mr Ong said about 85 per cent of the population would have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by this month.
Added Mr Wong: "We have already reached very high levels of vaccination - we are one of the foremost countries in terms of vaccination - we should now aspire to be a nation of testing, where testing becomes a way of life.
All he cares about is his Vaccine KPI!
eh fug off lah, i dont want to poke nostril everyday.
ask him to poke his own backsai everyday luh.
economic growth at all costs .
new citizens votes at all costs .
holy prince to become king at all costs
I guess he also doesn’t know what else to do liao .
The incompetence of the task force is allowing the virus to run amok in Sinkieland community
Small eye jinx lousy lah  
It is tied to his performance bonus.
Should be order from the top.
The death and infection are inevitable what ?
And the unlinked cases is sinkie fault.
He already worked on the booster shot schedule.
What more do you want him to do ?
Do a booster dance like what JC did ?
strict border control is the key, with Mu variant that can make vaccine useless, even 100% vaccinated also no use
can they look at israel ?
high vaxx rate but their cases spiking like no tmr !
Nation of testing means a lot of pple tio and kenna quarantine.
Really is CCBPAP
OYK is right, his focus is now on vaccinations rate and not number of cases.
only kumgong edmwer still so concern with daily case count  .
TSL already said once hit 90% all can forget wfh and go back opi liao , huat ah!
Siao the test fking painful, ask us test so often?
Just go back to social distancing la force people work from office for fk
This aljunied loser's performance bonus is pegged to vaccination rate is it?
I think he would have learnt from the last time he openly mentioned that HDB flats are depreciating assets.
Means he's the only one from that "must be a lousy school" loh.
Bro, their assurance worth how much huh?
I can buy Assure masks three boxes for $20 leh.
Bro, why he no dare admit huh?
Damn surprised that he would deny.
Bros, so many people and even vocie recorder software consperm it was Lau Lan Wong's voice liaoz.
If he low profile never hog limelight give speeches every week, at least maybe no people can recognize his voice.
but every week in on teebee taking the MiC, how not to recognize his distinct nasal voice wor?
LW probably wishing pple will forget about this.
Leaders without integrity is a big No No.
Bros, not him meh?
Why Leeporter leeport he got share in the convo huh?
Bros, not admitting that he said "must be a lousy school" izzit considered lying in parLeement huh?
Only 2 voices were heard lah.
Vivian & Monks Hill.
Where got LW voice.
You guys stop imagining things just because RK was caught by SPF for lying.
Dunno but irrelevant banter and lying when making a statement in parliament 3TIMES is very different
Bro, banter ish one thing mah.
But cummed out dare dare open eye say blind words to deny when question is integrity problem leh.
Order from the top?
More like all his kawan ask him bah, GDP is part of the consideration of their bonus structure.
This ambitious arse hole needs to be sacked.
More vax, more bonus.
Any more suggestions for noteworthy videos to upscale?
Must not be copyrighted materials like movies or record label music or youtube creator contents.
Juz dun be creepy.
wait, hope and failed efforts as well 
Ask yourself what you can do now to enhance ur chances and hopefully change the current situation.
Not regret ten years later for not doing anything.
23 year old nia kpkb really is loser.
chiu oreadi gotch a welly good advantage of 1.

and huai the weird decision to study masters in tiongland?
we must hab more and more join our bbfa crub!
I legit pinning all my hopes on China already.
I will be spending 2yrs there to do my masters…hopefully can meet someone ;(
i am going to bed now and be emo.
U only 23 AND GOING TO china.
u know china got how many chiobus!
when u are at 26, then come and KPKB,JJWW OK
knn 26 only me 32 how   
From what I observed, people who marry young divorce faster.
They are mentally unprepared for the challenges of marriage.
I reckon the correct age for sinkies to marry is about 30.
Then there is enough maturity to handle quarrels.
I was married at 30.
Now married 20 years.
Enjoy your single life.
Once married, there is no turning back.
Maybe this is a good time for you to LEARN how to date.
Yes, there are some learning to it.
What seems to be the problem?
Too shy to ask a girl out?
Good night to you and for your kind words…but China girls expectation also quite high 
I was lucky enough to get into Peking University.
So decided to go for it but due to the pandemic, China have restricted border access so Bobian have to delay my studies by a year.
I trying to slim down a bit to maybe sub-100kg before my studies next year September
i want your height  
I already in the club le ah 
One of us one of us one of us
huai lucky enuff?
just get into local uni masters better.
count yourself lucky.
tour the world without worries.
just get some companion there or go with friends.
own time own target.
 u also will sian if your wife is a b.
and totally not on the same wavelength as you.
then cannot divorce coz you want your kids to grow up emotionally healthy
not really good sia, I sit double decker bus the upper deck have to bend down…take mrt too.
The bank security suck to have this kind of thing to happen.
These incidents show how poor the management is given how dead silent they are.
No afford at all when it comes to PR.
I personally ignore all sms and emails from banks.
If it’s that impt, call me biatch!
but I also acknowledge that not everyone is as bochup as me.
And it’s unacceptable for the scammers to transfer all money by using ONE otp
The victims tio scammed cos they give out the user name and password so partial blame.
But OCBC processes is flawed.
How come it is so easy for the scammers to increase the transfer limits, add new payees and new accounts so easily?
Ocbc should make it robust such that it can sustain damage from usual password leak.
Thats what 2fa should do.
and the fact itsnt, ocbc at fault
Both has fault.
This looks legit?
Everyone needs to make the effort
Yes, they are partly to blame.
This incident is not an isolated case, it happened to other banks but the fallout on OCBC appears to be more severe.
OCBC did not act fast enough, and failed to block the phishing sites in time.
Why should you bank with a bank with lackluster security?
There have been reminders given already but there will still be some people who will fall for such scams no matter what.
This could happen to any company, not only the banks.
It is a very unfortunate lesson learnt for those affected.
Partially responsible bah.
Need to see investigation report.
NBCCB YES YES YES!
In the past, OTP was never implemented, the user only require an ID and a six digit passcode.
There were news that some POSB accounts were hacked simply because the passcode was easily guessed from their birthdate, IC ETC.
This is the reason why OTP is implemented, yet such scams and hacks till occurred to this day.
slow work process.
not enough safeguards
One day u give your house keys to a guy unknowingly.
That guy then wants to enter your condo.
The condo security should stop that person and verify his ID before letting him in.
That guy has the access card.
Go by side gate .
Which security guard company the condo use?
Their security guards are so well trained to recognize all the residents there   now all wearing masks too.
those who think is ocbc fault are the victims .
those who think is the victims fault are bbfa edmwers
With great power comes great responsibility.
Banks have been giving customers more and more power to handle their own account.
Some people are not risk averse, too hack care or clueless on what all the trade off for these conveniences.
Ask him to provide data to support what he said.
Can like that say one meh.
Not like we paying $$$.
Until covid mutate.
This ish the way.
Cannot be forever.
Even flu Jab also need to frequently
It was like a rough gauge by him.
better you don't know.
else you will open another thread jinx the validity of the vaccine.
my guess is 2 years
Until the dominant strain change to another type
Still only really respect one General.
Winston Choo 1st One.
Iirc he refused to take up a glc job offered to him
First full minister to be demoted.
He demoted meh?
That's LG Ng Jui Peng.
The CDF after Winston .
Winston Choo - Wikipedia.
it's ng jui ping, but he also became chairman or director of some GLCs/Stat boards.
Ng Jui Ping - Wikipedia.
The one after him .
Winston choo went on to work for chartered industries, now should be some ST coy immediately after retirement.
Heir to the Throne.
Ah thanks for correcting me!
Just ask who has war experience will do.
all paper generals with no war experience - how to compare sia?
who lost more lives during peacetime or who lost more taxpayers money during post army career lol?
step down when cmi
significant positive impact on sg?
Drive companies to their grave counted?
Negative impact also impact wor.
But ccs say generals are understanding, motivating and won the confidence of sinkies from all walks of life.
Surely there must be anecdotes of it?
paper warrios nia
Purposely speed up when I signal to change lane .
Depends on how far ahead u are .
If neck and neck speed up nothing wrong
please don't jump queue .
when people are queuing.
will you let a guy who wave and signal at you to jump queue in front of you?
At least 10 metre away
nice guys finish last
Signal light not enough la.
U must position the car to signal ur intent also ma
Sinkie drivers got ego problem one
Yes i experienced the same too.
You signal your intentions early and they take advantage of the situation.
they speeds up so you can goes behind them.
i more dulan those when i signals liao, they keep paces with me, and in front of my got one car just like to cruising there.
like that lagi kena stuck.
at least if the car on my next lanes speeds up, i can fasterly zips out mah.
literally if you go see, every Ministries almost all got create new post hire new staffs.
Huh like that means current civil servants more relax as got extra manpower.
whereas in Private is cut staffs.
There are more than 100,000 sinkie who are in working age now unemployed.
according to Leong data.
if they don't do something or massage the figures.
it will be terrible if they are required to present some data of some sorts.
But if these ppl go into the work force, they will be under paid for the current cost of living expected ,( better than no pay) and they would waste their best working yrs of their lives away.
This is the reality the younger cohort of ppl will face.
No saving, might not be able to finish paying for their HDB if they own one by 55, no Min Sum to satisfy ,no chance to enjoy their twlight years.
Owning 2 or more properties for Sinkie.
is but a wet dream.
Better than no job ma.
How much you pay him?
Maybe he join the safe entry ambassador, aircon and beo xmm.
Ahh, Singapore employers, the only people who can look at reality and say "no way, this can't be true".
Works in close relationship with our newspaper.
His first job, $3.
5K for fresh, wet nose graduate who needs training?
Means he see u and ur coy bo standard la.
ownself buey gan don’t call others buey gan.
If u so good why he quit?
Maybe knows the grad going to be his direct supervisor he not happie so secretly tekan him till he leave then maybe u all will promote him instead?
He do not have chance.
Because he is not trained in reading plans and calculations to deal with designers of refrigeration system.
I rem 10+ years ago when I grad, engineer starting pay was 3.
how dafuq issit still the same now?
even FT fresh grad in moi company get at least 4k
why dont u all send him for training or he refused to be trained?
What is the difference?
Actually doesn’t mean that he next time become team leader the Lao Jiao sup don’t dare to scold him or be rough with him.
The laojiao has already know all the workers and got many years of knowledge, this new jiao still need his advise and listen to him most of the time.
Tell boss and pm of red dot  to raise engineer pay by another 3k
As a hiring manager, I'd believe and take heed from this as much as I believe the 'Experts' on 160th
Why generalise based on the decision of a single fresh grad?
Maybe he just wants a year to yolo or even take a graduate course.
5k offer is market viable, there will be no shortage of applicants.
He found a better offer ma.
nowadays doesn’t pay to be loyal liao…
All my friends refer to 160 reports when offering salaries.
My company has no problem paying 3.
Since he was undergoing on the job training, 3.
5K was about right.
Thereafter we would increase to 3.
8K or even 4K after probation depending on his performance.
How were his hours ?
I saw you wrote 5 day week but how about working hours and any OT ?
You don’t eat skin?
Is it black pomfret?
Walau so many give bky lol
Home cooked always best lah that’s for sure 
Singapore Fish Files: Pomfrets and Pompanos - ieatishootipost.
I got eat is separated out
Colour abit dull.
u want better relations at home, try to eat together at the dining table
have fish ish not simple riao.
See when ish father day.
Maybe moi family prepared home cooked crabs.
Ps kill live crabs , hope gods can forgive me
I everyday jiak fish though
I eating at dining table lmao
Is meant to be dull one.
is fried de leh bro
"Even though our jobs were good, it was also very stressful and very demanding," said Santos.
"We didn't want that kind of lifestyle anymore.
We Singaporeans dont want that lifestyle anymore as well.
For every one of them that left, at least 3 FTs that are stranded in their own nations can't wait to come here.
1 Mossad left and villages of motherland will pour in, creating thousands of goo ld jobbs for sinkies.
I’m climaxing when typing this 
If expats stay on edmw also kpkb them
Plot twist: Mossad stay here 2 years finish collect all the Covid wayang intel by the MMTF.
Now is time to finish assignment and go US to share intel with CIA about the unknown status here.
Too many expat worshippers here lor
CAn you stop asking questions that hurt.
That's like asking why bbfa is single
These strawberry foreigners, a little bit of restrictions they can't handle.
Just feck off we are full.
Billions of ceca waitin for amdk to give up jods
He already mentioned, it's easy to travel to places from Singpaore.
His motive is to enjoy life, travel etc.
Singapore now cannot offer that.
so they leave to other places lor
Because kumgong sinkies and new citizens voted for the govt they deserved
Condo u don't renovate also look like **** mah.
So it's same same.
Renovation is key to making ur flat or condo look good.
I'm seeing more CECAs and their family at Bedok Reservoir.
SG is "easy" lololol.
this is a word to decribe those, usually women, of loose ways, aka like a whore n prostitute.
How come all your post is promoting china, bashing western countries and now u insult singapore?
Why don't u just move to china to stay?
Easy come easy go
why dun u stay on topic n stop imagining bogeyman.
or for start why dun u move to tw or murica?
These people see any criticism of China will immediately jump in and defend as if their life is on the line.
Almost as if there is some monetary incentives to do so.
On the other hand you don't see such similar intense dedication when it comes to Singapore.
In fact these Jokers often like to criticise Singapore government and Singaporeans.
Most can already conclude these people are not Singaporeans and are either JHK or tiongs foreign agents stirring shet here.
Guess wad feedback he received?
Using my 32inch Samsung TV as monitor since I never watch FTA programme anymore

Anyone know who is this?
It was the signature of @evilduxy
Yeah who is this cai?
Family not super well off but doing alright is already a blessing for you.
A degree holder doing masters soon that is something very good I must say.
Based on ur height and weight you are quite overwhelming even for guys in SG, let alone gals.
Height no choice but weight is something u can control for sure.
U can finish ur degree going further studies so what is weight control for u right?
Really don’t see why u should feel depress.
40yo bbfa reporting.
didn’t try for local masters.
Also wanted to experience a different country….
I went to China for a one month+ exchange during my poly days before and quite like the place.
So decided to take the chance
thank you sir for your kind words.
My friends always calls me Baymax 
dont be sad ohkay, you do facebook live, i donate stars for u.
I enjoy being married.
One must choose carefully though.
But this type of thing takes time and experience.
How old are you, may I ask?
why are u so insecure ?
You have the height, education and rich family background.
Please stop the comparison with your peers.
Be thankful that you have all these attributes .
Some edmwers like evilsun, say porkgai, golem, noobdriver are in a poorer state than you .
I am pretty much an introvert  don’t get how people do Fb live hahaha
thank you sir…I don’t like to compare bah…just that got this thought especially at night
TS, enjoy in China.
Exercise abit to cut down weight.
U have the height
Single is the best .
TS already has best outcome.
Idk how true is it but some of my friends mentioned that they prefer me at this weight?
Cos there was a period of time that I skimmed down a lot.
(~85kg) and my friends say I look damn bad?
TS is very well off physically already, compared to me  32yo 2/10 face buang buibui forever alone balding shorty  .
chiur fwens want chiu to stay in bbfa crub with us forever.
At least with covid over, u can find sex
Really ah…cos my this friend damn fit one but he mentioned that I am more suited for the bulking figure (ie.
fat or muscles) then lean…
mai latdat…my face also cmi 
best is muscular.
if chiu can be muscular at 1.
chiu won't even hab time to complain in here riaoz.
So many dinobu around, lower your standard
ts mai jjww lah .
either u do something about it or focus on other things
Heng all moi cc maxed out.
On a parallel thread got 1x case where $100K was taken, then $ was taken from her credit card via easicredit transfer or cash withdrawal?
but these cc transfer normally takes a day or two.
But OCBC so nua until a few days later the cc cash went into the account and again transfer out to the scammer bank.
no blacklist the scammers' bank number?
Its iphones fault .
its a called "Smart phone" for a reason .
if not smart enough to detect the sms is phishing then i spend so much money to buy iphone for what ?
same goes to Singtel .
i paid month for thier serices .
the isp also should be storng enough to not let scammers to sms me .
like that i pay 118 monthly for thier service for what ?
they will receive my lawyer letter very soon .
no consumer prottection at all .
All the bank apps are busy advertising their services in their app rather than security.
Ownself Check Ownself.
So no blame culture please
Can't OCBC stop the remittance given that is such a big amount and clearance of account to overseas?
Don't such remittances (big amount or clearance of account) send an alert to the bank's cyber security department?
How come the remit is the immediate effect?
Can't banks reverse the transfer?
Can't a bank have a system like if want transfer big amount, it has to subject bank due diligence first (eg video call customer, video call the transferee)?
Don't tell me the bank has no obligation to look after your money?
My question is firstly how those scammers know these people have ocbc account?
what is the most important thing is not to find fault.
is to find the culprits behind the act.
if the culprits are not caught and given life sentence.
they will come up with a more foolproof scam and claim more victims.
I think the laws are very lenient to these scammers.
only a few years of jail after being caught.
that's why more and more joining to be scammers.
because the risk to reward is good.
Like our pap election
Purpose of bank is to provide banking service.
OCBC failed to provide that service.
If you go counter ask for life savings, confirm will hold and kanna questions.
Why are there no checks for large transfers?
Also I believe the no otp issue, cos dbs already kanna many times Liao.
i think majority is still bank fault.
going down the hierarchy of controls, ocbc shd fundamentally implement additional layer of securities or upgrade its security layers before pushing it down to the users.
this scam has been going on for years and worsen recently when they all move to e-token / sms log ins
mass spam only.
i no ocbc account also received the sms
in edmw tradition, those who dun have much $$ in banks will laff and sleep very at nite knowing pple richer than them are scammed and made penniless.
same thing for little kids if died in accidents.
those few bbfas will blame parents not rich dun give birth
Orr Chee Bee Chee ought to shoulder responsibility
If the police of different countries can cooperate, they can trace to the receiving end.
All money transferred should be traceable from source to destination.
Someone hack into ocbc database.
opened another can of worms  
Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation 
Must be AHTC fault.
i dont think its possible to perform transactions without auth from the owner.
its possible that the phishing site was setup and the first OTP could have been provided by the victim through the phishing site which the scammer then used in the real site to change the phone number that the OTP was sent to?

aljunied ppl really got balls and got brains .
see through this small eye cunning fellow
High vaccination rate means they got excuse to faster fully open up like before covid.
Then their GDP will be achieved.
we forefront among countries with highest vaccination rate = we become case study for other countries when bad consequences happen despite high vaxx rates.
he really trigger reg flag
85% probably not enough for him.
Won't be surprised he tasked the expert community  to look into vaccinated infants to increase the rate further.
Singapore can thrive as a closed economy is it?
U want to plant vegetables in kampong?

Last month, 15 ppl have died from covid!
Today's number exceed 200 with 109 unlinked.
They are so chill about this?
Now I believe we are just numbers to them.
 If tomorrow I die from covid, it will just be a +1 on their death statistics.

That's what happened when u have a incompetent team.

Generals who fought zero wars and maybe have not held a gun for years.
It's like calling someone Casanova when he haven't had secks for years.
Who more powerful than him?
Screw up also no1 dare to say he wrong and instead grovel to praise him.

I heard he screwed up quite badly in Oz in one of his ventures
All I remembered was that Winston Choo was an ambassador to somewhere.
PAPship sure triggered .
Winston choo formal education only o level,  ask him be perm sec or senior gov official is bky.
So only assign him diplomat roles on the account of his staff officer experience in army.
If General need touch gun then I scared lol.
And also if need fight war to govern Sg then no one will qualify?
his wife lagi more powerful though.
self elected almighty Empress Dowager.
Can bypass watever protocols.
the earlier senior civil servants also didnt have degrees.
Took over public transport at worst possible time, tio stoned to death by social media, DID NOT DELETE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON HIS FB, just went to fix the problems
Dedicated to army.
No need to try & fit into any private or public entity as management.
I don't really know the real reason .
helming NTUC very well!
Do not expect him to work OT.
Exactly why he got rid of him, why would anyone help someone who will eventually become his boss?
Typical sinkie pawn sinkie.
You still newbie in management lah.
Just like my ah seng supervisior many many years ago, he probably thought I will get ahead of him eventually,  that's why he act like a tyrant, always try ways & means to get rid of me + alot of other shet things.
No, the supervisor will never be promoted to an Engineer because he do not have the skills sets.
He is only a hands on person.
I do track the learning progress with the supervisor and the fresh graduate every week.
Once the fresh graduate complained to me that his working environment is dusty, hot and stuffy.
Both the supervisor and I was stunned and kept quiet for a few seconds.
What’s wrong of leaving for better job?
demand and supply
I don't need that reply.
There is a lack of Singaporean graduates applying for the job.
We hired a UTM grad.
That is reality, whether you believe it or not is not changing my company seeing her this July/Aug.
That is why the company should not appoint some one noob to assume that position.
The new gen are more used to using the mobile than using their human skills to work.
The new engineer may not be able to learn any thing from the old bird and end up not able to perform his work.
Some one with working experience will be able to get along with the lao jiao and see through what tricks that the LJ is playing.
The LJ may end up giving the noob the wrong info to sabo him.
one local employee tender then oredi wanna higher from overseas?
actually what's wrong?
better to quit early than later.
if quit later, is waste ur and his time.
probation is like that what
Singaporeans are forgoing a 4.
5K pay and have to work in non air-con environment?
must add in at least $500 hardship allowance 
5k so high he dont want.
Cannot train poly grad?
5k up he will pia mia already.
5 and no aircon, no wonder leave.
Pls do the needful.
he got a begree, you need to pay for his potential 
Please, he is on the job training and the pay is around there with a chance of increment after probation.
Maybe he was bullied by the group of technicians he was assigned with.
If really as per what you said, I think is very good for fresh for ACMV contractor.
Unless your OT hours is ungodly.
So either the freshie is strawberry or got hidden details lor.
If I freshie that time receive this type of pay and working hours in construction I will very happy.

Everywhere in the world is suffering some kind of sort.
Flooding in China,Oman dessert 2 yrs of rain fall in 2 days causing drastic damage.
when earning money that time don't see them come out to do charity or donation.
Now no business for 2 weeks only already cried help?
Other business owners in Thailand still can donate food to the needy while having zero business.
This is why I don't pity these black heart owners in sinkieland 
Wah this Joyre group got 31 branches ?
The owner must be very rich wat so why worry over just 1 month no business?
They already take in the money when they signed membership.
So, what are they complaining about ?
They are having no customers to cash out the voucher now.
This is how ktv cluster happen
Better start offering rub a tug.
haha you got see the Facebook Singapore quarantine groups.
all the complain.
Really makes your blood boil
Tell the expat mai hypocrite lar.
it is the pandemic.
it is the same everywhere else.
in fact it is their fark up attitude of not wearing mask and fond of gathering and partying that kept the pandemic longer.
knn Reuters one sided leepokting again.
So many CECA still leeching here in Sinkapur.
have some respect for our Singaporeans both females or males.
If you don't agree, please leave.
There are many more important discussions to partake than this.
Ya , when sheet hit the fan , just head for the exit.
Thank for leeching.
To ensure other ang mor expats can get jobs in Singapore?
They've zero loyalty to SG.
Fair weather folks.
All these so called news are released to time the real bad news release of data like jobs data showing Singaporeans are staying jobless and unemployed while more FTs are given EP-Pass to work in Singapore.
Yes, I can further hypothesize that the sense of entitlement that FTs had developed over the years and especially during the COVID period in Singapore is due to the fact that PM Lee had over the last 20 years  given foreigners super easy access to the good high skilled and high salary jobs in Singapore as well as put them on a pedestal.
Please send some NSF to protect them
The numbers must be significant until PM 3 speeches said welcome them.
 MTF not producing outstanding results, expats are neither comfortable nor confident, so they go.
Only thambi ceca stays and bang bang
Not only Audis, generally Conti cars have more problem.
Continental cars are like that.
No money send car to workshop, don’t act atas.
conti cars are made to survive in conti climate not in this god forsaken place 
I used to drive vw golf gt.
Knn so many problems.
Everytime go service and repair is min 5K and above.
Now driving a humble honda.
Wah 5 yrs liao not much problem at all.
2 brands with worst reliability Audi and BMW.
The more complex the car, the more problems it has.
Every electronic sensor etc installed is a problem waiting to happen.
audi, volvo and vw especially.
always see my friend complain on socials .
those driving merc OK lehb
The infamous mechatronic?
Driving a audi a6 here don't encounter any issue at all.
Close to 3 yrs old car leh.
Maintain on time should serve u well, not a question about conti or asian cars.
Alot ppl say conti car leak engine oil and need to top up, I don't encounter such issue before.
Wait till ur warranty end then tok.
Keeping finger crossed.
3 years old Audi is considered still ok liao.
When your warranty runs out this year, and the clever German engineers have long planned for the obsolescence of mechanical and electronic parts, let us know how you doing next year (4th year).
VW group didn't become so big by building bulletproof cars that don't need repair, replacement and maintenance.
 Same goes for BMW.
They are in the business of selling cars, maintenance, and parts
This is so true
Ex colleague drives 5yr old a6, he carries a bottle of engine oil in his boot.
U shld Google the issue, its a design issue not maintenance related.
btw, the audi eat EO was previous gen issue.
i tink newer gens dun haf.
except for wear n tear la.
as long as ur piston rings age and get carbon, etc.
some oil will seep into the combustion chamber.
my old a4 eat eo like sai.
one wk top up almost 1L.
Not just that but the workshop will also hold off replacing parts that should be replaced until your warranty expires and they can bill you for it.
In my experience, never hold a conti car into or past the final year of warranty.
Just top up some money and buy Porsche, problems solved.
Audi, bmw and merz cars can do away with signal lights function as drivers rarely use it.
Save some $$ as well.
Sorry boss my car too powerful before i ish signal already in front of chiu liao.
What if 90% of such transactions are actually legit?
Will the others whom are not affected be complaining about the delay in transfer of money?
It should not be so easy for banks to transfer money else that will become another issue altogether, banks act on instructions of the owner of the money, the account holder should look after their own money?
One thing is for sure.
ocbc name is going to be shiat soon if they dun make a satisfying statement soon
Customer gong gong enter bank accounts details.
Bank gong gong just process the transfer of 100K from local to foreign account within minutes and not flagging it out
We’re in a ever fast pace environment that if we see urgent or in the mist of something we want to get it done ASAP.
If not you’ll be scolded for wasting their time.
This discourages people to pay attention in what they are doing.
If they could also pay more attention, plus a little bit of tech knowledge.
I’m confident this won’t happen.
edit: regardless of Engineering, MICE, etc.
my former managers expects me to be fast, even though I’m slower in mental processing
Don't trust and don't use digital banking because SMS OTP is not secure.
The banks can send OTP to scammers, or scammers can intercept OTPs.

​Isnt it abit too late now.
Ya i mean even if it's late is like wut?
U just reduce 5000 to 1000, got use meh?
If another victim click on the phishing link in sms, the scammer just change to 50k limit and transfer .
whose great idea ah?
But if you are busy and need to get things done, it’s very easy to overlook the well planned scam.
how many and how often one does that?
so system to detect?
bank could have hold the transaction.
for urgent cases , large sum, account owner physically go to the local branch.
i made a warning on 24th dec on my whatsapp groups lol.
but moi no frens, cant scam moi frens if moi aint got no nothing
How to expect all sinkies to be IT literate.
Many sinkies also heck care about learning IT stuff in sg
How are the scammers able to have knowledge of web services API, local banks 2FA , and deploy such intricate scheme without triggering detection systems ?

I think the ART self test kit is not painful.
Just stick the piece slightly into the nose (no need to be deep), twirl a few times and it's ok.
It's different from the PCR thing that they poke the stick into the very inner depths of the nostrils.

Be more confident .
When you are in China, do look out for your diet as the weather is cold.
It is easier for you to gain weight there easily .
I think as long as u reduce your weight, try to change your dress code and hairstyles should be a small improvements.
Damn bro you are right.
my dress sense sucks (typically shorts and t-shirt) will try to improve on that
where u find such a group de?
Just worry too much la TS.
You're still pretty young and have a bright future ahead of you.
You're pretty tall and abit buibui but moi think you just need to slim down abit then you'll look good liao given your body height/ frame.
Do both cardio and strength training, but most importantly do at your own comfortable pace and to avoid injuries.
Just go to China and do your Masters with an open mind.
If you're comfortable with yourself and your surroundings, then naturally you'll make friends anywhere you go one.

And how many death due to covid vaccine?
Ridiculous media trying to scare people in order to sell more vaccine.
wow who are these 13?
Vaxxx cause death in other countries and not in sink, how could it be possible?
More people die due to suicide.
Why are we not putting a stop to those?

Aiyo ivory jiakliaobees please make up your mind lah, always shift goalpost so xiasuay.

So how many more from the wet markets and hawker centres?
So weird of you to quote suicide cause suicide is something different from covid.
Might as well quote car crash, drowning.
Hmmm sounds fishy.
0 Vax related death in SG
So all those old people that die recently are from that cluster?
Doesn’t make sense

Sell after warranty don't buy second hand
You want satki than you must accept the pain.
I like this positive attitude.
Update us again when you reached 5 years mark.
Conti car out of warranty period better sell.
Worst is those folks who go and buy COE conti cars.
Those COE conti cars might as well be brand new cars underneath the old skin, cos many of the mechanicals and electronics have already been replaced before or due to be replaced.
Good luck to those people who want face but cannot afford.
etc diff story alr

How much is a refurb Audi MU or 7DSG?
Frend bought a second hand A8L told me quite cheap as owner difficult to sell it.
My altis last time, i never once check engine oil.
Drove till scrap
Ts never mention what problem.
Many Audi renew coe to drive another 10 yrs
TS no drive complain what
Clutch alone is 2k.
Don't think got refurbish clutch.
Mech unit about 3-4k.
Maybe refurb half the price?
good luck to those owners then
Sg sure got ppl rich enough to replace parts like these
Parents of the past would caning their children for not listening or against their parents with rotan but not now.
@wwenze How does it feel to share cool stories only to be debunked?
I have tracked his weekly progress.
Maybe you don't know about this, but there is a quick and easy way to see what the future prospect of a company is.
Just look at your immediate supervisor or hiring manager or whatever similar thing, because that is how he will be a short while later.
Is that guy having a good life?
Is he earning a high pay?
Maybe just casually ask, what car he drives?
How's his family life?
Maybe he see you as his boss he already half-sianz already.
Don't even know how to use the [Debunked] tag, later he do his job properly you also say [Debunked].
He just stayed there to earn a month pay while waiting for a better job, or maybe just out of courtesy.
then they take over your role.
and you become no value-add.
thus y  share lol.
share also 25% nia
Maybe Malaysians like you should be more appreciative towards Singapore.
Do not share too much cool stories to increase the fake profile of Malaysians, especially fresh graduates.
Malaysian Universities are not particularly prestigious especially when they are from third world developing countries.
I will gladly hire a good Malaysian anytime but if I ever see yours or equivalent CSB profile, out the window it goes.
Do not underestimate Singapore Engineers.
A ceca can do the job for 2.
Work in hot and stuffy environment, $3.
But add in dusty environment, sorry, I don’t want already.
Cannot tahan dusty places.
all grads have to suck up to u and say yes
He is a fresh graduate who needs guidance on  every step of the way.
touch ur heart la.
5k is over pay meh.
if u got a kid and he got 2 offers.
5k  work 8-5pm no OT from M-F, but need on site and in dusty environment and hot.
30-6pm, occasionally OT, but air con environment and can WFH, especially during this pandemic period.
which u will ask ur kid to choose.
especially during this pandemic period, WFH much better and safer
lol chiu ask o levels supervisor to teach a degree grad?
it's already a huge red flag.
Actually he left early now is better than waste everyone's time after completed all the training.
For the record, I do not think the pay is fantastic at 3.
I think its fair as the company is currently employing him to train and for the tasks he is doing right now, we could have employed a fresh technician at 2.
The company had high hopes in cultivating him, improving his career prospects and the next generation of Engineers.
Maybe he need guidance from you more than the supervisor whom he is supposed to whack when he passed his probation.
Why your co nv groom supervisor to reach the required skill sets?
If he wants to, he can go for courses at Polytechnic and later at University.
He doesnt seem to have the drive to learn anyway.
Be glad he left after only 1 months.
Better then train for few months or a year then resign what
I believe you are saying that the supervisor do not have the paper qualification for the role.
Did you inform the new engineer of the actual working condition during the interview or you are not involved in the interview ?
Seems like there is some mis-communication or the noob lied about being able to do the work in the harsh environment.
naos drives bus also cans gets 3.
stills needs to learns sho many things and works unders hots suns for huats?
I think that the present gen is pretty straight forward.
They will not suffer or stay in a new job that they dun like at all.
They will resign immediately.
Their parents will be able to feed them.
My mom done cash deposit to UOB using the automatic deposit machine using her own ATM card.
She inserted her ATM card and deposited a sum of cash in and receipt came out that it was another person (unknown) savings account.
My mom immediately went to the branch to clarify and the CSO raised a form indicating "wrong transfer of account" as if it was my mom fault.
Went back to clarify and confirmed my mom actually inserted her ATM before she put in the cash to the automatic deposit machine.
The CSO supervisor then voided the old form and amend the description.
UOB CSO said it could be someone else account but my mom put in cash.
But fact is my mom inserted her own ATM but yet the money went to another account number.
Was advice it typically take a month as they need to seek the person whom received the $$ to return.
But this is a technical error and not a wrong transfer of sum.
My mom wass adviced to wait for about a month for UOB to investigate and conclude.
Not sure if anyone experienced such situation and what are the options besides waiting for UOB to come back?
I'm skeptical that UOB just revert with "case close" after a month of wait.
such a big cock up also can?
i suggest you to file a police report
I tot insert am card will be own account.
Hope ur mum get the money back immediately
how much is that amount?
Insert own atm card.
Key in personal pin.
But can deposit into other people account?
How could this error be technically possible when she inserted her atm card?
Jitao report MAS, UOB will wake up their idea after tat
Let them investigate loh.
You ask here hoping the CSO is a registered member here to solve your problem meh~?
This sounds like a major atm/comp.
system cockup sia
Actually I think can be done?
Cos when you do a cash deposit there will be an option "deposit to own account?
And if you press no, you key in the other party's account.
recently hackers managed to hijack otp.
You got read anot.
The uob guy said this may take ONE MONTH to clear up.
If this is clearly the bank’s system fault then how come I the customer should suffer that kind of lengthy investigation period?
Must see CCTV to see if really got key in another party’s account liao
Provided what u said is true.
This kind better file police report then put big big on fb/mothership/Xin ming/WAN bao/.
So they will take note.
TS maybe your mum did this then entered the wrong account number.
Better double triple confirm with your mum before making police report.
file police report
Then what you want them to do~?
Deposit into other people's account wrongly is quite SOP one.
Call wanbao, mum ship, mas.
Pawn them deep.
somehow think this is a one-sided story.
I am trying to hit the gym more often nowadays (trying to do 5x a week) mostly cardio.
I am also thinking of going back to meal replacement shake (breakfast - lunch [shake] - dinner).
i used to do that a few years back, but it was more extreme…I had 2 meal replacement shakes and one solid meal a day on top of daily exercises.
While I managed to drop to about 90kg, I was really unhappy and eventually ballooned.
I tried wooing a gold digger before…the feeling sucks and I didn’t even realised until my friend managed to “pull” me out of the hole
It is okay to worry, just try your best since you are only 23 years old still can get pretty xmm.
If you are 30 years old, you might have to start accepting some auntie-looking women.
You forgot tell him go find Thai girl, they can protect him too, all mostly know mui thai
That’s my main worry…to be at 30 and still single
no need to scare him he is still a young chap.
Love might find him at the most unexpected moment.
We need to encourage him more than trying to give him negative comments on dating and marriage
Sian, local has to marry out.
sinkies girls really so high standard meh?
thank you sir, thou it’s true that if you married someone that is really jialat…it’s gonna be very Jialat
U won't get love.
But u can has a cheeseburger instead 
idk I find Sinkie girl really high standards….
out of the 3 I woo, only one was local.
One was from China and the last one was from Malaysia
Lol you open eye say blind word hahaha but I like hahaha
I prefer (double) filet-o-fish
What kind or cardio u doing?
Eat clean can le, those shake expensive sia.
I used this method to lose 20kg.
Bfast cereal, those healthy types.
Not the sugary ones.
Lunch I eat whatever I want.
Need to be in good mood to exercise happily.
Dinner, cereal again.
Sometimes if before sleep, I will eat a biscuit or 2 if hungry.
But I go gym 7 days.
 Member of fitness first.
I do body combat, rpm and body pump.
Need to build muscles, don't just do cardio
I'm 25, ps I thought I was 24 back then, couldn't care about my age, didn't bother to celebrate my birthday at all, had dated 2 officially, 4 underground (means parent dunno one)
there are more sinkie girls than sinkie guys from government stats.
I am also surprise why so many edmwers are unable to find.
It could be due expectation mismatch.
80/20 rules always exist.
Women and Men who are still in denial of their own standard will be single , aiming for the 20% which doesn’t exist anymore
Cut down on sugar, sugar is the real killer on weight gain
You tried to do too much riaos in a short matter of time, that's why you gave up and bounced back.
Instead of forcing yourself to go 5x a week, try to aim at least 3x a week instead?
And do more research on compound body exercises which can help you to burn more fat and build muscles too.
Just cardio alone won't help much de.
Rather than wasting money and buying shakes, focus on eating lesser unhealthy food and try to have a more balanced diet.
i'm in the same predicament as you 22M but instead, i choose to stay single as of now (probably in the near future too) cus of personal ideals.
don't fret too much, as someone who believes in fatalism, what will come, will come!
Will suay for the entire year or not?
Why mod don't wait until CNY end then issue?
u will huat for the entire year
Is will huat or suay sia?
serve as reminder don't anyhow post for the niu year 
heng ong huat   
Heng ah ong ah huat ah.
TS, grand supremacy member leh.
What did you post?
Wah, eve of CNY mods also hard at work.
I know why you kena alr haha 
if you tattoo the mod name that given you the infraction pts on your penis.
it will be huat for you on the coming years.
you counter his curse.
if not it is suay
don't mind the points but scare the timing only.
Horz horz horz.
TS gonna suayz big time for this entire year riaoz!
Get more infraction points til you hit auspicious total of 18 points
For what offend
what pic did u post?
How many vaxxed?
LOL the mistress cross examine the wife.
knn would pay to watch
We will see more death soon, our ICU would be quickly overwhelmed at this rate.
We aren't doing anything to actually prevent those absolutely.
We merely managed it.
So what's this hoo ha about COVID when we are already mostly vaccinated?
Majority should be fine with it anyways.
My family has achieved "herd immunity".
100% of my family members are fully vaccinated.
Does it mean we don't have to close our home for visitors now whenever there are rises in infection cases in the community?
means you only immune herd wise nia, they keep import wolves you these herds of sheep want immune also no use
a pack of wolves.
a flock of sheep.
a herd of sinkies 
Should sue the outsource coy.
Cognizant HCl or wadever for millions then take the money compensate back to the customer
Surprising 63% (so far) thinks it's the banks fault.
those voted YES are noobs .
Should i move my funds back to dbs?
I was looking through my Ocbc sms and realized that I didn’t receive any warning sms not to click on suspicious links on Dec 23.
I only received on Dec 30 and Jan 5.
but Ocbc said they send out warning sms on Dec 23.
did they really send to all customers?
“OCBC added that it sent out its first media advisory on Dec.
23 to warn of a surge in these scams.
It also sent out a second advisory on Dec.
30, to warn of a potential surge in attacks over the New Year weekend”
It's their fault for releasing the fund and not detecting anomaly.
People have spending behaviors and sudden big sums xfer should be detect as anomaly.
Should have a sms message.
U r about to xfer 1000000 dollar please reply yes to proceed .
Are u sure to proceed with this xfer.
iPhone / Safari / Chrone fault la.
how come never block the phishing website?
I has to be their fault partially, if it isn’t then why would they implement such measures after this incident?
Maybe some suggestions of how to strengthen.
After they strengthen, some people will write in to say too many layers of protection, cumbersome process, can banks look into simplifying.
Here we go again.
Overseas addition of payee should have a 24 hr lockup period before money can be sent.
33% stupid user fault.
33% telco fault for divert sms hack
Is not strengthen everything petty sum like under 100 dun need strengthen.
Unless consecutive 50 times 100.
But sum more then 50 percent is anomaly
Cos the scammers impersonated the bank, .
conned the account holders into giving details to facilitate them to impersonate the account holders to con the bank into executing the transactions under the impression that they were the ‘instructions of the account holders’?
Needles never poke their flesh so they won’t field pain 
iPhone fault lah
So what would be the threshold?
I am not sure everyone’s risk threshold?
This can also be data analytics data science.
User past data can detect anomaly.
Like usual month is xfer 1k around monthly for the pass 10 month.
This month 50k.
Anomaly is just unusual from the normal past data.
Just get a double confirmation with anomaly.
Do you wish to proceed xfer 50k question.
she wins by having a not bad voice + most importantly, she's an eye candy .
Because only 1 fully vaxxed died.
Be like the ppl in the UK.
This is the new normal.
But can our Karens accept?
so many country has reported vaccine death regardless what brand there is out there.
and in sg, not even one death.
u all better go n think again .
sinkie so strong until no death?
or are we just a natural VACCINE SUCKER?
All kiasee as usual.
That’s also why the economy needs foreigners.
Sinkies kiasee and nothing will ever be done.
There are also many who say no deaths related, like hk
OYK: let’s wait and see how many more die
Wuhan also fish related
Suicide, car crash and drowning, they do not spread.
Waaa … KTV cluster safer … no death and can song song gao Larwendar….
Power toot toot train is always keyi
must sing together then nice.
sing solo no nice
they also kena shopeed.
so they are colleague with CR7 now?
nicely written lyrics, like a poem, everything reverse
Power la this uncle
vocal not bad in cover version.
this is only 1 half of the duo, what happened to the other half?
Power Station of coz ish keyi!
Really is friendly and just want to do music.
Their concert is the best!
Still good just not as God like as last time.
The other guy just gotten married
put body ahead of health
Your problem meh?
You no life ah.
Your whole family and relatives got take covid vaccine boh?
Actually i know of one such person irl.
He thinks he won't get COVID coz he hikki at home lol
Jio mod 7pm tbp tonight.
Oh then it's prob the old staff making life difficult for the grad so once he resign can keep his rice bowl
Actually its more than the paper.
Engineers need to understand drawings and vet system designs.
Probably the newbies impression of the work is different from actual work.
Maybe is how we worked that got him scared.
I do not really expect him to be a hands on person but in our field sometimes even the directors go down to site to teach the technicians how to clean the parts and troubleshoot.
 Probably it was the unspoken expectations that we displayed.
now many engineer grads all upskill and jump to do software engineer/data analytics liao lo.
Limbei alot of friends(chemical/mech/electrical/aerospace engineering) like that de.
No computer science background also can go NCS/DBS/DSTA and code.
All these coding jobs pay 4k and upwards, sit inside cozy aircon office, got career climbing prospects, and lesser office politics.
Engineeer company need to up pay to attract/retain engineer graduates lah.
Sinkie grads can tahan hot weather, but not with mediocre pay.
If he were Paid better would he have stayed?
I got logistics cert can become engineer?
I promise to follow the boss everywhere 
terkan to force him out.
job security mah.
Maybe my mistake.
Anyway thanks EDMW.
why cant you get a dip holder for it?
He do not even have a diploma.
The position of an engineer is suppose to manage the team of technicians and at the same time read plans, vet designs for new refrigeration system.
He is only a hands on person, as good as Nitec.
most likely he is the reason behind the engineer's quit.
i would do that too if my rice bowl is threatened.
His rice bowl was not threatened.
We had an engineer managing him for a very long time.
Even with the shortfalls in Engineers, he cannot take on those roles.
This type of toxic character.
Not surprised ur engr run road.
U hire ah beng or snek maybe got chance
+1 to this, I have some army friends who studied civil engineering & I would say about 70% have left or are leaving liao.
The rest 25% are in engineering design firms so more office based & going down the PE track.
Those on site always cite the same excuse, mediocre pay (or same pay as those office counterparts) while they pull in 6 day weeks with long hours.
It's not so much the hours as the pay itself.
Also the lack of regulation of the term 'engineer'.
In europe only those who graduate from engineering schools - often 5 years - get to call themselves an engineer.
Here there's no such regulation, only for those who become PEs after a long while.
So anybody becomes engineer & the job scope also becomes more of a supervisory role than actual engineering.
If threadstarter is really serious about trying to hire cheaper local engineers, and foster the local engineering scene, and actually has the power to hire people, why not?
Since everyone agree that you don't really need much of what you learn in uni to do your job.
Like, maybe ask Ramesh and Misha, too.
And even the basics you can learn from internet nowadays.
LKY had the right idea with the poly system and limited uni intake.
However if threadstarter is working in a big company or MNC which has a rigid employment structure, like for example Engineer-1 must have a degree, then LLST, that one I also can understand.
LKY had the right idea.
Not all jobs require you to understand and use Fourier transform, for example.
(And you can learn enough of it reading Audiosciencereview anyway lol).
Or advanced calculus.
And the problem with engineering prospects in Singapore is that, even if we study advanced calculus, there is a lack of high-paying jobs requiring advanced calculus available here.
So what happens?
And everybody is unhappy.
Maybe hire a CECA to pawn him.
your engineer is those bookworm.
but your technician supervisor is seasoned old bird.
the saying goes; the older the ginger, the hotter it becomes.
Year 2021 still got unspoken expectations?
Close down the coy la TS.
Hiring contract, all the terms to hantum the employee is all there.
But when it comes to training you can come and tell us unspoken expectations?
Maybe if contract got put "+S$500 to salary for every unspoken expectation that employee has to face" then he might have stayed on.
Unless we are looking at the short term, actually polytechnic skills is insufficient for the growth of the company.
The company wants to slowly groom in-house PEs to increase our capabilities.
But most importantly, they have to suit our company.
Me too I got bona fide Science degree from NUS.
I promise to buy coffee for breakfast and shine the shoes too.
6 day work week 12 hour shift can tahan no problem for S$3500.
aiya, why limit them until like that.
it is not that your refrigeration system is very complicated.
just hire a dip holder for a fixed term and see how he swim or sink.
just like my current job, they want simi master in IT with 20 years experiences in enterprise DB management + AI, in the end, i just sit there and watch that stupid monitor for error.
If rich enough, just go buy brand new.
Unless you have a lot of time making friends with workshop owner.
It seems like audi sedans got more issues?
I'm driving a 3.
5yr Q5 no issues with regular maintenance and quite fuel efficient too.
so is it also due to driving style?
Same engine what
Typical conti problems are oil leaks, gearbox, engine parts like the injectors and ignition coils.
Add up easily more than 10k to replace.
Jap car maybe only oil leak after several years.
Suv drivers are less rough with their cars.
High cg the cornering not as good
BMW E60 and previous still ok.
Not so many electronics.
E65/66 also not bad, can last.
F01/02 and F10 turbocharged era onwards with tons more electronics, air suspension, electronic self leveling system and stuff, can forget it.
Drive 3 years better sell.
  Personal experience with all of the above models.
Bought and drove an Audi once.
Every other month in workshop.
And have to top up engine oil as frequently as I top up petrol.
Changed to Jap cars and no more issues.
Plus the Jap cars I bought are not as petrol guzzling as my Audi.
Engine oil disappearing issue is usually due to leaking piston rings.
Most engines above a certain age will do that, including Japanese.
For conti turbocharged cars, it comes even earlier because of the relatively high wear and tear compared to lower powered and lower load on n.
Japanese engines - owners tend to drive more gently.
Volvos a lot made in tiongland now.
VIN starts with L.
German technolovy go down the drain leow.
Got jaguar, land rover.
Made in England, check for new strain covid
To be fair, all those award-winning German engines of BMW and VW are technologically advanced, efficient and powerful.
But longevity isn't a criteria when the car industry rates these engines.
So just buy new, sell after 3 years to 5 years, and you won't regret owning one.
simpler design, compound with local dealers stripping out as much as they can to lower omv.
Audi needs to churn out cars fast enough to grab market share mah, now BMW also lost to Audi in terms of market share.
Buy old 2nd hand car complain so much.
I bought my Audi brand new, not a single issue after 2 years and running.
Hemg moi i only bmw(bus mrt walk)
classic edmw thread.
where all the jap/kr car owners start their argument with i-drove-a-conti-last-time.
fkn arm chio .
those friends who updated to conti.
all say they dont want to go back to jap/kr car.
rl quite diff hor?
Owned by Tata Motors.
someone need to start selling blinker fluid.
maybe makes sense also, since jap/kr drivers tend to be a budget sort, whereas conti tend to be more willing to spend to upkeep.
so those making noise people are those who from one group but jump to the other group unsuccessfully.
Japanese work culture very ke lian 
In before EDMW "I wanna marry her"
Bo lang support?
i am just stating the facts.
A master student with rich family is already half a battle won.
I am telling him not to compare as I feel bad for ssfa in this forum when truth hurts for them.
For TS, such issue is minor as compared to evilsun, sayPG, noob and gang
I am currently an anytime fitness member since May.
But due to the P2HA I sorta of lost my momentum and am trying to get back.
I typically do one hour on the treadmill.
~5km inclined brisk walk].
(Still don’t have the stamina to run).
my plan is to do as much cardio as possible before switching to weights to build strengthZ
thank you sir, my family are middle income.
I know that I have a lot of opportunities that some others might not have and I am grateful for every single one of them.
In this day and age, no reason for that.
 There's always the option of paying a girl to spend time with you   
No doubt that is possible.
I think someone in this forum did ask about doing this as a single and how their parents will view it.
OK, can try walking outdoors, hiking etc.
Anyway, don't need to look for love now lah.
Enjoy first k, so don't rush to slim down so fast.
Enrich ur life with experiences now is more important
thank you sir for your advice.
Don't suffer from the disease onegina too fast
sure you surf edmw at age 15
In the end   love urself and ppl around u is more likely happen
paying gerl to spend time no meaning de leh  .
That is transactional and not genuine, not what I'm looking for 
Wow it’s been that long….
yep I initially came on to EDMW-HWZ to ask on further education advice and on which path should I choose after my N levels in Sec 4
25 is a nice age.
I wish I can be 25 again!
Given your dating experience, you are probably at that stage where the next girl you find could be the One!
Pak tor another 5 years.
Then marry at 30.
Time to get serious and evaluate properly.
Keep having fun sowing wild oats Lol
about right…I hope to tie the knot at or just before 30 as well…
When you are trapped in a marriage, you will auto try to reach out.
Either that or jump off a building (not kidding)
Then do something abt it.
If u still worry n do nothing then u 40 also bbfa.
Check yrself in the mirror n see where goes wrong or r u seeking in the right direction for gf
Slowly cut lo else too fast is bad for body
30 is a good age.
I replied you earlier on this.
Now is the time to LEARN to date.
There are skills to learn.
Things to improve on internally.
Like your outlook on life.
Your ability to hold a conversation.
You'd be surprised.
There are many girls who view character more important than looks and money.
This is the correct target audience you want to attract.
Not money diggers who are only interested in you when you have money.
And I am not talking dinobu.
Many are pretty flowers.
colour not healthy 
50 is ok la I can afford 
Finish off with this .
Huai no add fish cake and pig stomach?
Only if you blanjar
Morning already jiak so heaty liao.

I like the Yam too
bro, try eating cakes, angmoh bread, ice cream, waffles.
those gcp foods.
and show them on edmw.
its a proven formula.
one piece 50 cent?
So little where got full?
If i order chiu kuay, i will always ask for more chai  po.

I guess that can be the way to do it.
No harm trying this.
Singapore‘s IT security has, in general, been really weak for years.
 Outsource to Mumbai la, see what you get.
Data leaks, insider scams, telco sms spams, endless calls from +65….
They all add up eventually and now you have people losing their life savings because the whole thing is so intricate, it’s hard for the general population to discern.
Every agency says it’s not their fault, SG government does nothing about it.
 Still want to be regional financial hub when their security is so poor.
I received only 1 SMS on 5 Jan.
It seems they are giving wrong info to the public.
should have an act to sue the outsource coy.
100 million compensate for security breech from cognizant HCL.
They have such capabilities on internet banking front end, recording of the personas for every individual *this includes geo location as well as transactional behaviour.
And, by right it should be blocking if suddenly a foreign ip is detected logging in where the actual personas of the individual is always in SG…::.
The lapse here is why it is not working/turned on.
There is no backend AI capabilities to track/show a huge spike going into an overseas account.
somemore the scammer literally wipe out the whole account.
the bank is not even asking anything.
These days its all STP, unless its manually track which is expensive
google has this IP thingy.
will ask user.
seems like you have login into google using a new IP address, email you asking if its you.
banks can even check it the new xfer receipt is totally new never seens before.
ask for confirmation.
its an anomaly.
They have it i guess but maybe didnt turned on/not working.
actually the limit increase without the need for otp is the killer.
otherwise losses would be limited to only the daily limit
If the money is mine, its definitely OCBC's fault.
If the money is not mine, its the user's fault.
if OCBC pays me to defend them, its whoever they think is their fault.
while ocbc could have been more proactive and done more to safe guard account holders’ interest.
the weakest link is still the one holding the phone.
there are cases where users did nothing.
money still gone.
these cases account holder literally did nothing and can do nothing.
those who click "no" will get scammed soon and cry
I received the DBS $20 Bicentennial Note SMS, I did click the link to check on the website and key in fake ID.
Tried 30min again, DBS had already blocked the phishing site, I don't see this happen to OCBC.
e banks can definitely do more.
kinda like it's  an act of sabotage.
like somethin' where u didn't do it but got accused of
it takes 2 hands to make a clap
The only thing weak is Sinkees,  cannot do anything.
Since nothing to lose, why not go aloha those head honchos of the bank & their families.
Just koe how to comprain & go bedok reservior.
Can they at least waive off the $2 admin charge if the bank balance falls below the Min requirement?
Dun worry, the bank will send lawyer letter to the receiver if money not return within 3 days
Pester them every 3 days lah.
Cannot let them take 1 month.
This bank is very wols and lousy one.
They need to be pushed
If this happen to me, pretty sure is my mum supposed to fulfill some obligation but gambled/give away the money and come up with ridiculous excuse.
lol very hard to justify unless the person willing to credit to you back.
Take it as lesson.
Deposit and open eye check account number properly next time.
I suppose she deposited to someone account before it was logged out, that means she inserted her atm card after the deposit.
Sound weird but highly likely.
hence why, never let older folks to such stuff unless its online, at least can zoom in to see the process.
and those bank tellers, techies and front end developers also la, use so bombarstic english for who  .
just put transfer from my acct to my acct .
or transfer deposite to this acct .
You mean the atm system did not “log out” from the previous user’s account?
Smelly trick like those AXS payment machine lo.
Key in liao then purposely go out of way then one blur f go use and tio liao
scary, is that atm kena hacked
Yaloh, If got insert own ATM card but $.
End up in someone else account.
Better make police report & inform mothership
Got CCTV also got atm log ma.
Otherwise just issue lawyer letter to bank.
For DBS, we cannot insert the ATM card if the previous person left, but the ATM hasn’t ended the session.
How about UOB ?
If it’s the same, then CCTV should be able to prove your mum inserted the card, hence should not deposit money into another account.
wah this is spectacular
The person MUST return .
It is an offence not to.
People have been charged for this before.
But of course the receiver can play the game if knows how to.
I won't advise how.
Not easy because you'll face police pressure.
But essentially you have to return the money if wrongly received.
Lol no lawyer will stupid enough to sent to bank
Few weeks to a mth.
U go ahead and send wrong people and try lo.
Not an offense.
Easy to say bank account didnt check amount.
If it is an offense , i will just abuse it and sent to anyone i hate then call police liao lo.
there is ur answer
Never double check meh?
I thought normally will ask u to confirm
Yes this is true.
I had such an experience before.
A chap left his card and I was next wanted to withdraw.
Of course I did the correct thing and exited for him and chased after him to get his card back.
I also had another experience lately, where a gal left a few notes behind after withdrawing.
Also called out to her.
People don't get tempted by such silly things, these are all offences if you retain/withdraw something that isn't yours.
Criminal Misappropriation - 403
These pple really jelly.
Peole use $$ buy the parts, pple pay for the power as well.
Haha wasting power.
Then gaming not wasting power?
Watching online video etc.
Personal entertainment not wasting power?
Talk about environment etc, how about smoking?
Pollution + die of cancer etc.
Why no ban smoking?
Drunk drivers kill how many already?
Drinking got any health benefits?
Why not ban alcohol?
SP never question u?
pay money still want question what?
Too late to start mining?
u see GPU prices here, scalpers will take their cut first before u see any profit 
When can we have dine-in at restaurant, food court, hawker centre, coffee shop?
14th June or never again?
Sick and tired of tabao.
Heng TS not scrabby else sure tio jinxed
isnt tabao the same as dine in.
u r eating the food
No to dine in forever.
Let's do our part to keep hawker and foodcourt.
Just dabao and go is the best.
I hope lawremce womg extend the dine in ban until august
You have a point.
 After awhile, NEA may forget they have a thing called return your tray.
gobment say will review and not confirm ma.
scarly, increase 5 pax but no dine in how?
cause dine in, remove mask, then up case again.
Gov never provide free mask that can be use while eating one.
No more eating, no more entertainment.
Just work and pay tax.
Very safe from virus.
Isn’t life wonderful?
can't wait to go coffeeshop jiak huazai roast pork 
Ban dine but unban work in office
Count down to bistro-in​
As long got unlink cases, pls don't be foolish to unwind P2(HA) measures.
Will require more tightening and more suffering time later on ?
TS ish silver serpent anot?
I dont tink the cost will be more than the amount being scammed.
Cannot say OCBC faultless.
Kana nearly 500 scams in 1 month but act blur meh?
Pap fault for so pro business there is 0 consumer rights here.
Disgusting elites helping themselves get richer.
Businesses like ocbc take advantage of the lax regulations.
Prob that time is holiday period even IT pangkang so took so long to block that phishing site
Ownself click on some random link is whose fault?
My transaction all fingerprint only, and I only use the app, never in a browser.
As much as I think the victims are at fault but bank also cannot escape it's responsibility
Click link is user fault.
People notice money transfer out call ocbc but no-one pick up n stop the transfer is ocbc fault.
Money gone due to we call them but they unable no response so conclusions is ocbc fault.
Pls payback money
See the cast vote.
really like the 60 plus percent who vote for it and kaopei.
click link is user fault.
 But the incident response by ocbc clearly shows that it is not up to par    
OCBC just has very poor security protocols in place.
If you continue to put money there it defeats the whole purpose of keeping money safe in a bank.
The vote count like pappy supporters
If all the 400+ cases occurred within a very short period, then bo bian, not really much OCBC can do.
But if the scam has been going on for quite a while, OCBC really should have done something earlier already
No, it’s always AHTC fault.
Last time there is a official ocbc member in edmw.
dunno why haven come out edmw clarify yet?
Edmw oredi do the poll for ur bank.
can see pple not happy here!
ur boss still dun want do anything ah?
Partly to blame
maybe their boss say radio silence until they know what is going on    
all bank should have a quick way to freeze own account for such case.
knn 23yo still young la, i'm 32yo never had gf before
maybe not in the next few years.
pull down mask chua sai.
Actually, getting a girl is not complicated.
For some lucky people it comes naturally.
For the rest it takes work.
It's not easy.
But if you want it enough you can get a gf, or at any rate a girl who's genuinely into you.
Marriage is another story.
Auntie staying home everyday waiting for my handsome oppa to one fine day drop into my home only.
Make me feel like a playboy, play around with different girls, but don't feel pain when I break up.
Being said, I told myself not be so hopeful, can find jiu good lor, if not life still goes on.
Alr know what type of girl I like, in terms of characteristics & personality, parents & friends can accept & acknowledge the girl I'm dating, able to cook & keep fit is +1
You should be doing exactly what you are doing right now.
Keep churning gfs.
You are on the right track.
This is what I did.
Then when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired, this is when you know you are ready to settle down.
This is how you know she is the One.
There is one more important reason.
When married, you will be more determined to never look at another women again.
After all, you have already "been there and done that".
You know how it ends.
Then you will be more determined to work on your marriage.
Not look for alternatives.
Many married men philander because they married their 1st or 2nd gfs.
When things go awry - and marriage is seldom smooth - they don't have your experience to draw from.
They "itch" for other women.
This is how marriages break down and how their children suffer.
she can suck my helium gaogao
You’re those quite insecure and quiet guys is it?
23 yo only woo 3 girls is quite little.
Just use dating apps and cast your net.
Ask friend intro girls also can.
Quiet yes…I am generally very introverted unless I know you well.
In terms of insecurity, I guess it might be that vibe that I gave the 3rd girl that’s why she grew tired of me.
any tips or suggestions?
I tried all the different dating apps le (CMB, Tinder, OKC, Tantan) but feel like they are either 1.
Very Superficial 2.
what you have severely omitted is that this group of girls are statistically unattractive by proportion to the entire dating pool of girls available 
What ur height?
Go hr can find Le.
Wait, you must earn more than them first.
Serve 2 years ns.
Loss of income is 48k to 200k for guys lol.
Truly a privilege.
Most likely will tio hiam by them.
Just take time ah.
Earn the money and find someone within 5 years younger than you.
Most importantly, don't be too despo ah.
No single mothers and above 30 peeps
80 percent wants the top 20/5 percent mah.
In tinder, it's all about looks mah.
Never about ur personality.
23 is still young sia why so emo so early?
There are guys in 40s here still unmarried
i personally do not use any dating apps, but I know people who have found long term relationships on them.
So imo, it’s not the app, but how you sieve through all your scammers and nonsense people who are wasting your time.
I would like to believe that there are genuine people on the app who are trying to find long term partners there.
I guess with all these “distractions”, y’all are finding it hard to find each other.
I think in order to lose the superficial feeing, you need to form genuine connection as friends first.
This is probably the hardest part through dating apps.
Since you’re still studying, it is probably much easier to forge genuine friendships in school instead, then see if anyone can click with you and can develop to be more than friends.
This is also why it’s much easier to find relationships in schools than in work places, since the latter also has more politics and individual competition.
That being said, there are people who have also found love in workplaces (non-cheating case).
Put yourself out there, take the risk, be vulnerable, and play the game.
precisely, by that very post he has totally destroyed every shred of credibility that his advice or whatsoever has provided previously .

YOU HAVE A GF LEH!
HER NAME IS CALL COVID 19, she is 19 years old and LOVE YOU UNTIL DIED!
AND SHE WILL FOREVER WITH YOU AND ACCOMPANY YOU TO HELL TOO!
But recently, she found out you are seeing 2 ladies name Pfizer and Moderna, and gf feels sad leh.
dont break her heart bro.
U no career no condo no car.
U wan which girl to like u
Parents being able to feed them is one of the reasons, the other is that they know life is too short to be stuck in a job that they would be unhappy in.
Working and work-related activities take up at least 1/3 of their day.
notice period is one month or 3 months?
Only toxic people can thrive in toxic environment.
Like how gut bacteria can thrive in the rectum.
he local anot got gone thru ns anot
He don't have to give him problem.
Just need to say or show how tough or bad the environment or the job itself etc, will have lot of shts or whoever difficult work with etc.
Or maybe don't even need to, your Junior engineer on job working probably saw or felt it.
If the person lacks of experience or not his preference to such working style or people, ya most likely he won't waste time n zhao.
That means your pay to him is not attractive enough
You very naive to think this way .
Best way is tekan till the new guy cmi and auto leave, he will be the last man standing and who knows he will be considered to be promoted and take up the higher role when you guys cannot find any better candidate.
Just ask ur boss post on jobstreet la.
5K salary alot fresh grade and even experience sinkies will apply.
Last time my company post within 2 weeks 80++ cvs came in .
Must state first mah.
own conti before, if not how to join the conti bash bandwagon?
But only can afford sibeh old conti.
leave this detail out purposely 
Only one rule:.
If want conti, please buy brand new
and sell away before 5 year is up.
Yup as cars get older or have more mileage.
wear and tear like bearings and seals will wear off causing blow by and oil consumption.
 Can switch to slightly thicker engine oils if notice oil consumption going up,if not planning to overhaul.
These oils may form some kind of a plug effect to narrow the leak but not always 100%.
why conti cars so lousy?
I intend to buy conti coe cars.
Better than 2nd hand jap cars!
In b4 top up abit for.
Paging for Sammiegirl for more insight.
My previous Audi drive 10 years until scrap no major problems leh, just wear and tear replacement and tighten engine mounting.
See luck and how u drive
under our weather and humidity = problematic cars.
Japan has seasons like european countries.
Japan's winter no less harsh than Europe's.
Hard truth is that Japanese cars build quality is far better
Also wear n tear is expensive for premium conti
fleet of toy cars.
The problems are vicious cycle.
is truth that once you goes conti you don't go back Jap.
however, I go back Jap just so I can buy super big item.
the feel of torque and speed when you step the accelerator.
NA Jap cars can't compare.
even right now after 1 year back in Jap car.
still can't kick the habit of the  step accelerator torque and speed expectation.
now I step nia.
the next moment I release.
can hear engine zrooming sound very nice but car no move as expectation.
I've owned and driven extensively conti, kimchi and jap.
jap certainly is more reliable.
But contis just bring a smile to your face when driving.
Doctors that fear no work life balance
need to reinstate their suspended doctors to help out
Why they so stoooopig wan?
Don't know how to make field hospitals ah.
Maybe they lazy to watch over so many measures.
Pinoy doc must be thinking Heng he kena fired from his job or else now he have handle all this sheet 
Could it be the ratio per population is low in the first place, especially for icu?
Can talk about everything in Punggol.
Where is the nicest czechar?
I like crab master best.
Which part of Punggol is the most beautiful?
I don't live there
Punggol is nice.
Shame about the people there.
Is all i want to say.
Here nothing good has been said about punggol leh.
You know punggol got rental flat?
Anyone tried Punggol nasi lemak?
Not at kovan meh?
No wonder I can’t find after up and down
End up I ate lasagna in Punggol again
in before "dont be areacism".
Must be inclusive of the whole of Sinkapore
all playgrounds, basketball courts overrun by CECA
not that true lah.
where you live
alot of low ses strawberry staying there.
I only know punggol park is in hougang
Got the sg canal of Venice.
don't talk cock.
you live with your parents right?
already sold the lous bto low ses place and moved to town
Punggol is the son of Malaysia
take medicine first then you realise you still living in your parent house
There is an indian international school in punggol hence there are .
1) a lot of entry to mid level (5k to 15k per individual) white collared talents staying at HDB in punggol.
2) there are company provided buses from punggol to CBP for a number of banks and tech companies.
3) with the upcumming tech park in punggol, you can expect more delta talents.
We are cecapore, cecawhoreans
Straight thru process….
U need humans to eye ball manual transactions?
Its easy for you or anyone to say but the cost to implement will be high.
Everyday there is 60K-100K of transactions.
Operations budget are very tight.
can see results are like pappies vs oppo erection.
Mummy's fren just comed over and she buyed a gift over, telled us we can unwrap nao and eated, then moi unwrapped and sawed it's Ferrero Rocher chocolate, jin disappointed  
Ferraro is low ses auntie buy one.
Now is give Royce, Godiva and Laderach
got ferro better than none
[very disappointed] no pic thread again
…First world problem
still a decent chocolate treat
Moi neber heard of this Laderach brand before.
Means moi ish low ses?
Ferraro rocher jhj
huh beri good liao leh
Maybe left over from lunar seven month
If really see you no up, would have given you van houten or kitkat.
… your mother friend got dotter?
very disappointed with your “buyed”
This TS is the new yak chin?
Every 5 min got new stupid thread
Looks like I need to upgrade my goodies.
I always offer that to my relatives.
got rocher to jiak still better than me .
me jiak 4 days old ang ku kueh
Damn low crass…
its the thought that count.
can don't give you anything
I got Use uob deposit machine I also catch no ball how is this possible.
The moment the screen asks what else you want to do?
If you exit take out atm card the receipt is ejected and the welcome screen shows liao.
I really catch no ball how come the previous user’s account is retained in memory.
TS i not totally convinced by your mother's story.
better to verify again.
old people are forgetful.
Check see the money is send to India or.
I'm asking if anyone had encounter such issue which bank holds you up 1 whole month to investigate.
By then the CCTV recording likely would have been overwritten.
Old ppl might have blur blur keyed in wrong option but explained to son otherwise.
Happen many times before.
Maybe that machine card reader has been rigged.
No matter whose card u insert, it will always go to a specific account.
Then very scary.
If take out ATM card means logout, it should never happen.
I can’t imagine what other innocent error could happen.
Recently got overseas buggy Telco allowing SMS to be diverted for fraudulent credit card charges.
Criminals are getting more and more sophisticated.
You can key in other people's account number.
Which is the concern some of the records or even cctv video may be overwritten.
By they raise this incident initially as if my mom fault to transfer wrongly and need to request receiving account holder to agree the transfer back.
But pretty sure with ATM card inserted it would be a system error for another account.
Ps: UOB automatic deposit machine don't need pin number to deposit cash.
not like DBS (which is because it give you option to deposit and withdraw)
To be honest, this is such a weird situation that 99% of ppl have trouble believing.
I advise to make police report to force uob to expedite.
My guess is on their end they also don’t really believe your story
The Police is not EDMW.
Statement taking is not just ask 1 or 2 question, you answer correctly case closed.
They will ask a number of background questions.
They will look at CCTV footage of you, the person before you and after.
CCTV/transactions for banks there s a law must keep for 6 years I believe.
Ok so once you did a genuine mistake, that one can kao tim, but repeatedly do it?
I had a friend who received money wrongly and spent it.
But he knew how to answer.
He escaped the charge but it was just a one off and the amount wasn't large.
But the bank notified him that he would have to return the money and he agreed.
If he said no, after the fact has been proven that it wasn't his money he would be charged.
But you can take some time to return it.
But large amounts no excuse.
Grab went to wrongly credit 250k into a guy's account, he act blur refused to return even a bit.
He was later charged.
Sentences will depend on amount, 250k will easily get a year or more.
How can this be possible
cannot be put in own card & key in own pin and money goes to another person's acct.
unless is during deposit TS' mom went to choose deposit into someone else's acct & manually keyed in that person's acct no.
Unless it’s personally key in the acct, there’s a possibility of keying a wrong acct number….
Cannot Singapore banking laws make it clear must keep for a minimum no of years and if no reports then only can delete/overwrite
Reminds me a time, use a bank app.
Keyin my own user name and password, keep getting into other person account.
Login again and it displays other people account details.
Skimmer is steal your card info.
Totally different from what ts is describing
honestly hard to believe the story.
you dont be surprise alot of people do that
I am not surprised, but come to think of it, we don't exactly know how this covid-19 virus is spreading, on the surface that have been contacted?
No one knows for sure what kind of evolution the virus is going through.
All we know is that the virus is super infectious and is now spreading like wild fire.
This guy shows his face and the company uniform.
He was wearing mask in preparation of the noodle and take off mask after packing,  there is no one around also.
Bro, look carefully, the one preparing and the one packing are 2 different person.
This is not about stirring, we have to safeguard Singapore, our home.
People are doing whatever we can so that this pandemic can be over.
It only takes a few individuals to spoil everything.
Please report it to the relevant authorities
I see the local or don’t know msians or whatever eating inside stall.
Customer order with them when they have no mask on face (one side on ear) then they proceed to make drinks.
Another is not wearing any doing pancakes.
I also saw the indian chef wearing mask but liked exposed underwear see his nose n beard.
I think is sg indian.
So if u think only FW u r wrong.
Or the young chaps in restaurant kitchen not wearing any masks!
Eating in kitchen!
Or the cashier not wearing mask n eating at counter.
They Shld be sitting at customer place to eat not eat at their station
Haiz, all these can't be helped.
This one is a little too blatantly doing things.
Youncan see from his other tiktok videos, the number of people he mingled with during his off days are.
I am not against him meeting up with people and shooting tiktok videos, but he should do it outside his workplace whereby the products are being supplied to the masses.
Which authority to report to?
Feedback - SFA.
Arrest, cane and deport.
only factory workers dont wear mask?
i tot they are everywhere now
Lulz, i predicted spread by public toilet.
Alot of people go toilet pangsai no wear mask
True true, they are everywhere.
But for this case, the noodles will be delivered to Singaporean's primary dining source.
The repercussion will be very great if he somehow has contact with the virus somewhere.
He can do it once, can't guarantee that he will not do it again.
you think inside resturant and hawker .
always wear mask  or wear properly?
Also not cooked food leh.
U mean U don’t wash the noodle then straightaway cook it?
Aiyah ever since mask wearing became compulsory, I hv even seen it in restaurants.
Then again who am I to judge?
It’s hot Enugh being in the kitchen even without mask.
Of course that’s why covid spreads.
chiu all donch be a poosy.
scared this scared that.
that why asians more inferior to ang mos and ang mos are dk.
they continued living their life.
you see europe and usa.
got any serious repercussions?
Where can I buy fresh banmian like that as a consumer?
They pay so much money go poly, the knowledge not relevant to be hired?
Either way PAP has failed the nation.
doesn’t matter which u blame when the root cause is the same
unfair hiring practices .
Not MOE issue, even if u gahave the skills, companies will lowball u
how u know is the salary kenna low ball or just everything else over priced?
TS don't understand?
nothing to do with education, its the unfairness (kaki nang hire kaki nang) and they come in truckloads
u have people like lesson paying peanuts to get uni level grads and expecting poly people to know uni leveel stuff .
pay peanuts and expect alot
In the past, the society was engineered so that there is no overabundance of of graduates or a group with certain specific skills.
All of a sudden, there is a shortage of skills/talents.
Nobody should be blamed.
Did you see Pritam blame anybody yesterday?
If even the leader of the opposition did not oppose, then what's the problem?
CECA has no authority nor any clause in it that can bypass MOM to allow anyone to work in Singapore.
MOM has the final say on their work permit applications.
So why is even CECA involved?
U miss out landlord scream for rental income and property appreciation
ns for sinkies.
Ceca dont think so.
ceca will bang table and slap sinkapore if not allowing more ceca in
Its proven that ceca allow more ceca work and play in sinkapore.
Didnt our Minister has already clarify that it is not the case?
Report like that is proof that we are not letting them in as they like.
So moving on, we just need our opposition to check on them on this issue.
Isnt that what they are for in the first place?
Then send your evidence to PSP.
So that they can bring it out in their coming motion if any.
EIP more important ok.
it’s not easy to immigrate .
especially now !
Yes blame our education system for not teaching us how to sell snake oil.
some more he paid in full cos he wanted the credit card points and now he has to tell his guests they cannot go and then hotel refuse to refund or even upgrade the menu sia.
Can kpkb and complain to authorities.
So long as service not performed can refund
Kum gong nobody pay in full
Tell MOH , see what is their view .
If not go social media show all your receipts and communication messages with hotel.
jin satki hotel
Jsk credit card limit.
can one shot pay.
My limit only 2k nia
who in his right mind will book 250?
Just stick to 100pax, don’t anyhow invite lah.
smart ones don’t even hold banquet.
can request to increase mah ?
name the hotel or this is all csb
the hotel is a quite atas hotel in orchard area sia.
he also kena stun when hotel say no refund or upgrades .
Maybe can, but my monthly not high la.
So don't wear so big swimming trunks
Why cant refund?
Service not provided no?
Why do we want to hold a banquet for 25 tables?
Are all of those 250 people there really happy for you?
I would rather just invite close family and friends to a max of 2 tables at a nice restaurant for a meal and scoot off to a month-long honeymoon
Don't think fren telling him the whole true ba
if is good credit card company with excellent customer protection policy and service.
he should contact his CC company immediately.
if is UOB just be happy they never ask to take more money from you
then open 25 tables and perform social distancing with 2 to 3 pax per table then.
or tabao the food and pass it to others.
tiagong hotel cannot make this arrangement.
wa when he call me today to say i cannot go he sound sibei sad sia
dabao the food give to dormitory
Waiting for your tips
Have some dignity.
Don't be like those losers who keep begging him to appear in the other thread.
Good things come to those who wait.
Near basketball court in front of Punggol plaza.
basketball court has Chinese playing on one side, the rest all Ceca.
Fake news and not resident lol
before that , u should take first.
if dun have dun worry i sponsor u .
Sty Punggol a lot of Low ses jealous neighbour de .
All cannot make it

I really really don’t want to live there .
my flat in amk reach 5 years .
my brother getting a new unit .
moving the whole family there .
and rent this amk away.
I feel like living alone .
but my parents keep nagging
TS which Ponggol RC u working at?
don't confuse love with companionship.
many people are in relationships or married because of companionship.
I dunno what data you have or what experience you speak of.
But I think your view is severely flawed.
Here is my data.
I was never single since 16.
I am not good looking.
I rate my looks as 6.
Neither am I tall or successful in my career (i.
But I have countless gfs and partners.
From air stewardess to secretaries to bankers.
Most 8/10 to 10/10 in the looks department.
I can tell you they can easily find better looking and richer guys.
Yet they prefer fugly me.
In fact, dont flame me, my problem is the opposite of many here.
Too many women.
It threatens my marriage.
Up until a few months  ago, there were 2 more ladies that crossed my life.
I won't go into the details.
Very attractive ladies with no lack of suitors.
I turned both down.
And I am at a ripe old age of 50 now!
Because (decent) ladies are more attracted to whats inside a man.
Not outer appearances.
No offence, if you can't eat sweet grapes, i can understand you will say the grape is sour.
Or conclude there are no such thing as sweet grapes.
I reckon women are like a supermarket.
There will always be many types of products available.
You are probably looking in the wrong section too.
So you conclude that "such girls are statistically unattractive by proportion to the entire dating pool of girls available".
The truth is, if you know how to polish whats inside you, they will come in the truckloads.
TS please go buy a mirror and look at own self in mirror.
You'll thank yourself when you see your friends start going through divorce and child custody proceedings.
Meanwhile, all your wealth belongs to just you.
when u post like this.
y no mention what type u looking for?
Maybe convert to bi, then got more choices to find ghey also lor
Your Mommy will always love you.
I think so too 
whats the group called?
Give you a chance.
You want date me or not?
Moi 30+ yo still havent hold hand or pika before, u kia simi?
Edmw bbfas is always here for you .
better be prepared for next 30 years of singlehood n focus chiur energies on other things
why you spend so much time 1 hr on the treadmill?
Given your age of 23, that’s not going to do anything.
You need to quickly start doing the weights as soon as possible to see visible results.
If you are scare of free weight, Even the machine ones also will give you result.
walking around for 1 hr on treadmill is just wasting time for you.
Though I dunno you I’m just assume you are healthy.
spend less time on edmw .
Then u will get a gf
You think people who are attached or getting married found love?
Not all though, some found companionship, some found breakup/divorce.
50% of marriages cmi, the remaining tahan each other.
Imagine compromising with someone the rest of your life, just to have a companion.
You will never fulfill your full potential.
But why scared?
It’s not unforeseeable isn’t it?
Hospitals all collapsing now, cant deal with imported cases also
Sinkies gg this direction isn’t it.
gong xi gong xi
Yea I know, but I don’t understand.
If they believed it to be endemic, surely they expected people to get infected right?
Just let the virus run free, no?
The gov stupid lah, covid local cases still on the rise yet wants to go ahead open to tourists.
Prostitute Singapore still dying to spread her legs
Its a bad idea , deltas is beri strong
Anyone with a brain knows it will fail from the get go.
They just trying their luck.
Hoping for the best.
But not prepared for the worst.
Meanwhile SG govt want to live life like endemic.
should measure icu cases instead.
Countries that don’t take Covid seriously should be dealt a lesson they will never forget.
So it covid numbers never come down countries remain shut forever ?
Yah lor i dont see any alternative if your economy is dependent on tourism or intl trade.
Tourism is like what 30% of the Thai economy.
30% gone means millions of jobs gone, millions no food to eat.
They don't need any pilot program if they study our imported cases.
“put in place a temporary ban on tourists leaving hotels”.
lol smlj, local population got spread, tourists end up getting shafted?
Some ppl for some inexplicable reason just seem to want borders to remain shut forever.
They should not look at the numbers.
Thai needs OYK.
All CECA chiong there with fake vaccination certs?
Sure will make sure the healthcare system there collapse.
open some more.
Overseas exchange programmes and internships are key to equipping our students to thrive in a globalised world.
As part of efforts to enhance the international exposure of our students, the Youth Interns Exchange Scheme (YES) was jointly established by Ministry of Education, Singapore and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) of China in October 2019.
Originally scheduled to be launched last year, the scheme was delayed due to the #COVID-19 pandemic.
But we remain undeterred and the Implementation Agreement was signed by Singapore’s Ambassador to China His Excellency Lui Tuck Yew on MOE’s behalf and MHRSS’ Vice Minister Mr You Jun this week in Beijing.
YES will help about 500 full-time students and recent graduates from polytechnics and Autonomous Universities from Singapore and the equivalent from China, to participate in overseas internships in our two countries.
Our students can look forward to updates on internship opportunities in China on the YES website (yes.
sg) when travel resumes.
What about India?
Shouldn't we foster ties and cultural understanding at an early age there too, especially as LHL is an early believer.
OYK, when he was MoE, wanted to send kiddos to India.
So what is the outcome?
Another jinx project?
hoho means more ceca to fill the position here
to cater for SG PR a legitimate route to go back China and nvr come bk?
china is the best!
Who in their right mind wants to do internship in China?
996 stressful lifestyle on top of food,air safety concerns.
Our innocent buey gan youngsters go china to get makan alive ah
I assume you are an ethnic Chinese Singaporean so maybe you are not interested in India, but how sure are you that Indian Singaporeans are not?
China is where my ancestors came from, so I have some interest in that country.
   But you don't expect an Indian Singaporean to have the same interest in China, from a cultural and historical POV.
 It is only logical that his affinity is for Chennai if he is a Tamil Singaporean.
and not for Xiamen or Guangzhou or Swatow.
sinkie girls scare go there,.
sinkie guys won't want their prostitutes.
go tiongland better.
can find prostitutes MLs FLs standard better than what is available from boss sam's stables domes
I won't be surprised at least a few thousand parents would be interested in this.
 I am being conservative because it might be tens of thousands.
Are you sure sinkiebu scared?
 You need to mix around outside more leh.
 A lot of sinkiebu are now dating ceca hor.
 They work in banks and IT together, and then love blooms.
the rest is up to your imagination what they do in the bedroom lor.
Please lah, doesn't matter what race, Sinkies will only want to go AMDK countries.
because china is no longer behind singapore, it is far far ahead.
of course there are still banana china haters who are behind the times.
Can tell this is spoken by mountain tortoise who have never worked with China MNCs
Next time we go China work as coolie riao.
Our forefather will be proud of us.
while ceca come here earn big buck
How come sinking girls scared to go there?
Thought they like Dhalsims a lot?
Or maybe she accidentally saved another's account number by error and then deposited there.
But I forget even though I have 2 UOB cards, I think UOB deposit by card no need key in pin no.
Just deposit only.
But I forget if this is true.
never pay attention to such things.
A lot of people pull down their mask while talking on their phone inside bus or mrt.
Hate this type of irresponsible people.
scared stay at home.
I'm sorry about other people
very muffled talking lah
take their photo and send to SDA lo.
ask them fine them goood good
i also pull it down to hide 1 corner makan
Eating not the same mah
these should be fined
Seen some pulled down their masks to sneeze, multiple sneezes at a time.
Yup I note it too
Have you seen people walk and smoke?
Yup, seen many times
U must be one of them.
Wear mask under chin or nose
i just take them off.
eating drinking dont need wear mask.
brisk walking dont need wear mask.
just hold a drink or some food n go about your daily business.
Why need to do that leh?
The phone mic can pick up a lot of sound one .
Unless those kum gong wear a mini mask for their fat farking face that squeeze against their lips
So far office meeting many wear mask and talk still can catch what they say.
Today one pinoy lady call.
i use alot of brain juice trying to understand what hospitalisation plan she talking about.
Before my brain fried i told her not i not interested.
and she kept yapping and yapping.
I had to tell her i have to end the call.
Because our mrt the world noisest, the system announcement repeatedly with 4 different languages kept over swarm normal conversation, u should ask authority mrt operators cut down the high volume long winded announcement from suspicious article to trace together bullshiiittt
heng i no friends.
so no nid talk on phone
Read the article.
its frm ceca mouth
huai never find out tooth and ask parent whu they voted first?
How to blame MOE?
We hv high ranking uni & Cambridge paper.
So how do Uptron & SPU got jobs tat sinkies would be qualified to do so?
Blame pap not moe.
Vote pap out for better future without ceca
i blame my parents.
why give birth to me 
I think if u trace back to the root of the issue then u should blame your parents
its really those companies who do such things
Instead of learning programming skills in young age we have useless subjects like social study.
MOE didn't have the foresight led to this mass import of ceca for IT
in before blame ownself
Moe has a part to play too
After more than 10 years and we still importing.
meaning nothing is improved
Your transcripts is snake oil proof
In exchange of investments?
Blame both, so who is responsible for it
Same reason why edmwers blame sinkie girls when their cog smol
Ministry of trade and industry has a role to play too
On the onset of Covid19, during the glorious day of govt declaring no sick no need mask, almost non of our food handlers wear mask.
No outbreak leh.
Chiu tik many homebased food sellers got wear mask oso meh
Those inside restaurant and hawker stall, the spread is contained within the premises and the spread can be contained and slow down with the trace together app/token.
Can the bags of noodles be traced?
v edmwer thing to do.
actually if u walking around the dom at night, can see a lot of foreign workers nearby chillax not wear mask properly
Those walking around the dorm unmasked, even if they have confirmed case, it will be contained within the compound itself.
Stirring to protect our countrymen.
If situation gets worse here, they always have a choice to go back to their homeland, whereas ordinary Singaporean like us have to suck thumb and stay on.
Wah seh, want so serious boh?
Arrest and deport is good enough liao, still cane ah.
Cane to give him souvenir to bring home?
Hr bo do work lor
Ya right, continue living their normal lives, but we have not seen the aftermath of 'freedom'.
The time is just not ripe yet.
You mean you washed your noodles before cooking it?
 And the packaging may be in contact with the virus.
For that you will never know coz nobody will disinfect plastic packaging.
Wet market stall selling tofu/noodles should have.
I saw one cook putting the meat ingredients in a stretch of bowls probably Ard 15 bowls.
After that he stacked one after another put beside the boiling water container easy for him to cook for each order.
This is quite similar to the tze char stall practice.
This is done to increase efficiency.
As long as they don't give you that bowl to hold your food is considered good already.
put himself in trouble  
What kind of trouble has he put himself into?
Singaporeans not hygienic la.
We are a cleaned city not a clean one
Everyone please do it, if 1 person report maybe the authority heck care, but many many report, they can't turn a blind eye on this.
I have already reported.
Myanmar Ban Mian anyone?
The British citizens stranded in Kabul - podcast.
Day after day, Ahmad risked his life to come to the airport with his family, British passport in hand – only to be left behind when the last evacuation flight departed.
Now he and many others who hoped to be rescued face an uncertain future in the new AfghanistanAhmad – not his real name – left Afghanistan after the US invasion began in 2001.
He sought asylum in the UK, and eventually settled in Glasgow, finally becoming a citizen last year.
But his wife and children live in Kabul.
In August, with his wife heavily pregnant, he flew back to be with them, believing there would be time to bring them back to the UK if anything went wrong.
But the baby was born even as the Taliban began to seize control of Afghanistan’s cities.
When the capital fell, Ahmad, armed with an email from the British government calling him forward, came with his family to the airport, in hope of a flight out.
Now he and many others who hoped to be rescued face an uncertain future in the new Afghanistan.

Surprised no one said this:.

It may be 30 percent in terms of gdp but it’s effect is much greater in terms of employment esp in some areas.
Phuket for eg.
The domestic  service  sectors are dependent on income which follows indirectly into the sector ie locals who spend money having earned them in the tourism sector.
hence their desperation at opening up, there is simply no alternative.
Ppl are relying on charities for meals.
Kids are going to school hungry
Their lady boy jialat.
close border lah.
the sandbox project is really doomed to fail
such a small island open up to tourists w/o quarantine since what.
now not even 1 month.
have to close down the program liao.
instead of tourists go there spend money.
now these tourists go there hog up the medical infrastructure of the small island.
then what will happen to the islanders there when they kena the virus too?
left to die in own house?
what more to expect for a small could try to endemic and open up to the world w/o quarantine.
see how fast will toh.
ya probably hitting hospital capacity then reactive.
Can they seek oyk advice and guidance .
Number of cases does not matter
pretty sure they know its coming.
Fly jinx ong over to fix their mentality
iirc the Phuket population rely mostly on sinovac vaccine .
this vaccine not so effective against delta variant
It really was for them, they think vaccine is magical, can mean COVID-free.
Actually hospital capacity also not for politicians to decide.
They should be asking hospital directors and doctors
It's simple: get rid of the virus then open up.
Otherwise you end up with this unnecessary unending escalating cycle.
Should track death cases lah.
@singapore Govt pls look at this
at least they tried.
No more Thailand for the next 5 years.
Heng I go Thailand is to buy gold nia.
Go those QB house and Kcuts lor
Business bad thus no surcharge
Learn to cut own hair now.
Don't like wear mask and book in advance to a hair cut.
the salons charges extra 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after
Means actually no need surcharge but want to squeeze u dry dry.
Moi still poor so become hairy n go after CNY  .
Great, fk them & their CNY surcharge .
Why reduce when all struck in this small island?
People no money to cut hair this cny?
all spent on extra virgin olive oil.
max usually hair cut is increased by neighbourhood stalls , now i mostly go  those 10-12 cuts , sometimes they cut 6 dollor only , can can
There are still hair salons with no surcharge if you bother to look for them.
If hair Svc all x 2 during cny, might as well go malls to do
ownself shave can liao lor
I dun mind pay but I hate they spend 30min just to cut a normal high slope.
In 30yrs ago katong pointers only takes 5min
need to cut public hair
And you pay for all the cruise, expenses you feel very Lugi, how to hint to her you want it?
Asking for a friend by the way.

So this one is the PRC students who take scholarship to study at NUS/NTU etc, sign up to sexchange back to china for internship?

Seeing his face irks me.
Whacked him harder whenever my character travels to **** land to face him.
Best is can teleport to the back and give a good kick with extended legs.
Jin songs sials can go china find ATB!
I think once they experience the China 996 work culture through the internship there, they will truly appreciate Singapore work culture more when they come back.
Don't forget 1SGD is 5RMB.
The workers there are paid peanuts compared to here in Singapore.
Unless they are an expat working there at expat rate, no sane person will downgrade their lifestyle to work in China and earn lesser.
So I think is good that they can go there to know what a working hell looks like.
Sinkie go there to work in bed nia.
Free one who dowan.
 Salary can be negligible lah.
Let’s not be narrow minded and if you have the opportunities for overseas work, please go for the experience.
Just make sure salary, etc is right.
You will be surprise at the kind of opportunities you might get when you return.
go there tio lape n scammed?
train more CCP comrades.
Why China and NOT INDIA?
Singapore has ceca arrangement with India no?
If its China because its the near future gateway to the world then why not "ceca" equivalent arrangement with China instead of India?
It makes no sense that we import this many Indian pmets into Singapore and yet our workforce do benefit from India!
What are the benefits of ceca India?

Up the mountain many many have to meet the Tiger right…
Where is he now… no gps meh
sigh very sad for kimchi kor kor
salute him, he died in  pursuing what he believes in knowing his disability is against him ( i am sure he is aware the danger).
So many examples for us to follow yet we choose to do it differently
even if they dont uplorry from covid they will uplorry from poverty/bankruptcy
 Objective of the vaccination programme is precisely to prevent collapse of our medical infrastructure.
 With vaccination,  just recover at home if kenna covid
This is an example of not having high vaccination rates.
Not apple to apple
Can always come sg.
Pap lub all fts n tourists
They shld follow our lead to declare total victory and make it an endemic lah.
no monitor no headache!
Exactly sinkies dun know how fortunate they are to have oyk.
the second coming of ah gong for us….
No more income for the jet ski scam
Friend told me 4 people were tested postive for Covid yesterday when they arrived in Koh Samui.
2 were Thai with 1 AZ jab and the other 2 are Europeans with 2 jabs of Pfzier.
The lucky thing is Samui sandbox so far has less than 100 oversea tourist since the 15th July.
Most freedom centric ADMK will want to have fun that’s why open up Phuket for them.
It’s sad to see end up get quarantined in hotel can’t go out, because I think they really don’t care they will just cheong everywhere if you let them.
local gov probably more worried about local people that’s why the closure.
If continue to open, sure a lot of people not scare die one cheong Phuket until high death rate.
Local hospital how big only, can save so many people meh.
between economy and human life, we witnessed the history has always chosen one side, because no one can take care of you or your family forever except yourself.
If not open up, die, open up also die.
Might as well.
open up and let the stronger ones live.
Except that there isn’t any clear path to getting rid of the virus, is there?
It will take the world many years more to (mostly) fully vaccinate, and even then vaccination doesn’t mean virus eradication (as we see in UK US Israel etc).
So should countries lockdown borders for another 5 years?
Why didn't they direct to morgue and -1 count?
They open to tourism.
End up is locals spreading covid around.
What vaccine they used?
Must be too many piak piak right  
So … I see your plan is to close all borders forever then.
Cos even “almost closed” Australia which accepts only 3,000 arrivals a week is struggling with lockdowns now.
But I'm surprised Singapore has chosen to follow that philosophy, even worse that many of our leaders have gone through NS.
And what does NS philosophy say?
Do 1 time good one, then can go back bunk.
Just tough it out for a while only.
But no, have to make compromises here and there, airport cannot close, citizens can come back, end up we went in and out of CB achieving nothing, HA here and there and achieved nothing, daily cases still around 150 average, begging people to vaccinate even though 70% of the key demographics vaccinated already, while countries with 30% or less vaccinations have been open for months because they bit the bullet and suffered for a while, now no need to care about vaccinated, no need to care about masks and distancing, back to normal except for airtight border controls.
If we close, and enough countries close, then all the closed countries can open to each other once everything settled.
Then we will live in 2 worlds, 1 COVID-free world, and 1 endemic world.
Australia burst precisely because they imported the virus on a flight, that's their downfall.
Yalor, why flip prata so fast?
Anyway I already predict that this will happen
Can suucck thumb only
You might as well use debit card.
Debit card is dangerous.
i dunno about whether he has 250 people.
but we have 250 people here sleeping well tonight
Tell your Fren:.
Get the hotel to tabao the food for the 150 guest.
Get the brothers and sisters who your Fren will cut out because of the 100 limit to then deliver the food to the other 150 guest.
Also get them to collect the Ang Pow's for your Fren.
Actual intention is to collect ang bao to cover?
TS wanted to save face and mentioned his friend instead.
pay with credit card, just chargeback
If your limit is 1 K and you have cash 10 k, and you pay 10K into your CC account, your credit limit becomes 11K.
Quite surprised lots of people dunno this.
This is 1 of the reason why some people can have 45k spending on the CC even when the limit is only 10K.
Spend 10k pay 10K before the due date, u immediately have 10k limit again.
 Ngei ngei want to invite max.
Want to get more ang pow lah.
Of the 250 pax, how many actually want to go?
wa siao he say now sibei sian need to call a lot of people to tell them they not invited.
just name and shame on social media.
will get them to respond
wa I ask another fren he say he also not going sia cos uninvited .
fwhaaa jialat leh.
but taking a huge risk when planning rike that wor
Very kumgong of your friend.
this type can only blame himself
ts got a lot of imaginary friends
Couple got quarrel over this problem.
Maybe the wedding won’t go on as planned.
TS your friend is his problem.
Why you worry for him?
This type of job not easy.
But at least don't film ownself without mask.
ouh what a way to get lots of views for your videos.
Preparing one with mask look like AT or VK, whereas the one packing without mask look like JHK
No la, not my video la.
The one without mask is definitely not a JHK.
All his other post seems to be in Burmese.
Well well, what's done already done.
What kind of job is easy with the mask on?
Nowaday quite a handful of burmese, viet, AT, HK, Pinoy and JHK working here
This kind of noodle factory usually is sole proprietary or family business.
The HR will be multi-tasked.
Where got time for all these things?
On Sundays and PH, don't even think of going into their meeting ground.
Can't even squeeze through, that was the time when 'social distancing - who cares' attitude comes in.
how you know if this is a local factory or not?
Seat inside office behind computer.
That one not doing any physical labour.
Not really leh.
I part time driving Grab wear mask whole day while driving also very difficult, and I am not doing any physical labour as well.
1 man's irresponsible action may lead to the suffering of many many others.
Anyway sometimes need to close one eye.
Unless peepur are sovereign and whole day no wear mask, then that one must pawn gao gao lol
Some things we can close one eye, some cannot.
For this, if one eye is closed, the situation may get out of hand.
Closing one eye is still depending on case by case basis.
They only say received my feedback leh.
So many days liao still no reply from them.
Perhaps 1 x feedback = stir sh*t.
Need more feedback for them to act on it.
From his posts, this is not the first time and certainly not the last.
Now that the COVID-19 virus is so prevalent, it's time we protect our loved ones, ourselves and our precious hawkers.
Some of them are really old folks who really can't afford be infected.
We are know how deadly this virus can be, to those with underlying illnesses.

It's because WhatsApp is not working properly on your phone.
Please buy a new phone and use the new phone.
After that, donate your old phone to me.
Thanks in advance.
what phone are you using?
Are you on android?
Sometimes developer never update properly for some particular model.

From my understanding, your recipient whatsapp app needs to support this feature for u to do it
most likely is the phone.
There is a time limit to delete messages for everyone.
how long ago did you send it

Who did TS vote for?
Your answer is there
this message has been deleted
it's a 2020 model what
TS donch know how to google or never even try to Google for the answer issit.
or neber read what the search results show.
donch know what to say about TS question .
politically-correct ish say "there is no dumb question" but sometimes ish like someone got their own watch but ask other pple what time issit like that.
there is nothing wrong with your phone la.
it exceeded the time limit liao.
regret telling the girl you love her right?
and that ish sho shitty.
Basically repeating the mistakes of our forefathers.
Ayia u see how many guys do treadmill on gym u know liao.
1h is not useful better do some weight training
sometimes is the time.
not yet arrived.
there's no such thing as converting fats into muscle, you need a calorie surplus to build muscle, to burn fat you need a calorie deficit.
you can't both burn fat and build muscle at the same time.
I don't know what's your body type now, but you're on the skinny side, just consume more calories with high protein in your diet, and lift low-rep sets with 70% max.
cardio is useless for body-building if you're skinny.
if you're fat, you can do both cardio and weight lifting.
Increasing your muscle mass improves your metabolism and helps you lose weight easier.
Some people watch too much tv, got preconceived idea of how love should be.
They never got out of that loop of finding something that isn't there.
In the end become FA.
Its a choice, U want to be a BBFA for your whole life or U want to merry a import chiobu bergin wifey and make a happy family with many babies.
Dont wait for the gods upstairs to drop U a wifey or grab-delivery one to your door-steps, nothing is free in this world.
The amount of money used to tackle a wifey (with no guarantee she finally will merry U)  is definitely more than all the investment used to merry a import wifey.
perhaps begin the journey within, where u find endless change within, then u'll be dispassioned
Whats wrong with bbfa ?
Nothing sad about being forever alone.
Its how you use being alone to your benefit.
We r happy to have one moar BBFA member.
Welcum to bergin crub.
There is no benefit to being forever alone.
Social media is also another illusion btw.
Can spend all your money to simp on Onlyfans
I find your post very insightful.
For the dating part, is it ok to play mind game meh?

See how many give ang pao.
Song bo FA like me rejoice at others momentary misfortunes
He csb you lah…  Govt already said it will protect these folks
Your friend so bold?
Complain to case.
See if they care
Call the Wanbao come interview and complain.
Tell them orh dang the 150 pax.
Next time marry again can use it
split 2 sessions.
do lunch and dinner session
TS create thread to troll but instead kena suan kum gong .
dun believe ts.
sometimes all this young couples so adamant about holding a banquet.
Its covid period.
Why still wanna go the trouble to hold a banquet?
Just have a small reception with close family and relatives will do.
Why need all this attention for what?
You invite people to go your wedding, they also force to give angbaos.
Now economy also not good too good and these attendees also must have to fork out money.
Just ROM for legality and do away with banquets.
If die die still want the attention, hold it next time after this pandemic has been eased away.
Must be the bride want attention, wanna make up pretty pretty etc etc let people see.
Nobody cares one la.
Marriage life also between husband and wife only.
Some couples do this to "feel important".
You can put so much time and effort to plan your wedding day etc, we as attendees, only go eat the food, look see look see, congratulate you, smile smile and we leave the place and go about our lives again.
We dont even care after that.
Why the hassle especially during covid times?
Use brain abit.
so how much is he going to lugi?
wa people suffering already still kena suan.
tiagong they follow the government regulations exactly lei.
But later MP asks him who he voted for
like crypto market now.
Here's the thing.
When restaurants cancel booking or take less customers, when airplanes don't fly, yet their staff and landlords are still getting the same pay, where is their pay coming from despite doing less work?
That's right, from the victims.
All the lucky people still don't know the free riding effect they are having on the society.
Believing it’s endemic is one thing, it’s another to have the policies and capacity to deal with it , especially with the low vaccination rate at the moment .
People who caught the delta covid are literally dying in their homes
sounds so familiar.
i hear an echo so near sia.
this is a warning to our so-called endsimi strategy .
ends it before it's too late .
So many examples happening ard they still wanna push for it…… vaccinated or non vac also e same
Some ppl for some inexplicable reason just believe that as long as their desire to open up is strong enough, they don’t have to face the reality that they haven’t recover from a pandemic.
Maybe some of the tourists come come countries that sell fake vaccinations certificates.
Maybe some of the vaccinated tourists are actually infected but show zero symptoms on arrival to Phuket.
Its definitely not unexpected
Cannot blame them la.
Thailand too dependent on tourism.
Go YouTube watch Pattaya video, entire town dead liao
Many sinkies really think they are special.
If not for reserves built up over the years and the govt can give some help, even more would be retrenched.
When you are retrenched like those in Thailand, you will be desperate to open up too.
Just because never affected your own rice bowl, you say people stupid, really bunch of retards.
Everyday only know of getting the govt to give them protection via lockdown etc etc.
Such protection cost money and cannot do long term.
People who are poor and no money to eat have their own reason to open up.
Just because you are not hungry enough cos really no money to eat does not makes you any special.
Put you in their shoes, no job, no money etc, you will also be desperate for economy to open up.
Rather have 2% chance to die from covid then 100% chance to die of starvation
Prayut keen to showcase.
fell and bloody smack flat on the pavement face down squarely now.
Hopefully countries watch and not learn.
90 is their gahmen threshold, just move the bar to 200 and life goes as as usual 
No herd immunity
considering Singapore does not have huge pool of resources to spend on disease control and management like China, suffer-once concept will not work.
Given that all it takes is for one mistake to slip through, who can guarantee new variants won't seep through the future border control once we open up for all?
Mass vaccination is the key to protect our population by statistics, 99.
9% of people lives, 0.
1% die, is kind of acceptable from the politically correctness view point.
This is not a dictatorship cruelly nor ethnic cleansing, it applies to the general rule of the fittest survival, the weaker ones always lose out, in almost all aspects of life.
Without Covid, same amount of people would have perished for some other reasons anyway, for example road accidents.
Many are worried about the adverse effects of the vaccination in longer term, it is a valid concern.
It took almost 5 years for Ebola vaccine to get approved officially by the FDA and is not guaranteed 100% safe.
I think we just need to be a little bit more realistic that even we cut the time by half, it will still be 2 years away until Covid vaccine can be FDA approved for x% of safety applied.
If we don't open up earlier, everything we hold dear now, our job security, handsome income, foreign investments, lower cost labour, life conveniences, will disappear one by one.
We will become a nation that is full of highly competitive people, without an economy structure to support their needs and wants.
Life will be 5-10 times harder than now, tax will be 2-3 time higher, happiness index will definitely drop.
I don't think this is what people wanted to see.
Before the long term vaccine effect hits, let say affecting 20% of the population, the 80% of the population might run out of options to have a good life in Singapore.
Everyone will want to downgrade the HDB to get some cash in the pocket, we got so many 1-3 rooms HDB to downgrade for people?
Can you compromise on your kids study and tuition fees?
Singaporean needs to travel overseas twice a year to feel good, can still afford?
MNC and local big corporations will hire older people over younger fresh grads for 5 times cheaper cost when the labours flood the market?
Even you are willing to take over our dear Bangla brother's road work, the construction company also can't afford to hire you at the salary you needed.
Whole day worry about KTV F&B licenses, you guys must be kidding.
one small island also cannot declare endemic.
we one country going to be endemic soon!
Aug is really our independence day
Haven start already know the end result liao
Who can guarantee?
Of course cannot, but that's not the goal.
The goal is to do everything in our power to prevent it.
Vaccine is for the individual, contact tracing is for the community, border controls is for the country.
You can go on and on about vaccines, but it's not choosing one or the other, all are needed, multiple levels of protection, cannot skimp on one and rely on another.
And this is all ignoring the part where there are countries with local economies fully running, no masks, no restrictions, only with no immigrants.
We have more than enough construction workers in dorms, still need how many?
When the whole country is clean, no need to worry about their health, instead of right now where dorm cases pop up here and there, whole place needs to be shut down.
And they're all vaccinated already, where do you go from there?
What's your plan B when you finally realise vaccines are not enough?
Plan B is if Vaccination fail, will find some excuses to say that we need to continue working on more effective vaccines.
from here onwards, vaccination is also plan C, plan D, all the way to plan Z.
One bottle of Oyster Sauce can be used to cook many different dishes.
Seriously lah, the problem is not about blocking out and not letting virus in, the problem is that as long as a country has to depend on others for survival, we cannot close the border.
At the deeper level, this is not how the viruses work also.
You think when the patients recovered from Covid, the virus is eradicated 100% meh?
There are some left overs in them being managed by their own immunity system.
If time is right, the body is weak, the virus outbreak can happen again on the same person.
No matter how rare it is, remember, it just take 1 such incident to populate the virus back to the whole nation.
Under such circumstances, how many times and how much money you want to spend repeating over and over again on tracking and curbing?
Not everyone like US and China when money not enough just run to the printing machines oi.
I also don't know which country in the world only have local residences without foreign workers or tourists of some sorts.
Even then they may have foreign monkeys trespassing once in s a while, without PCR test and passport some more.
It's not a hypothetical, it's reality in a few countries, they have opened fully already, no masks, no restrictions of any kind locally.
And why do we need to depend on others for survival?
That's all pretend only.
The useless SIA can keep giving billions to do nothing, we have more than enough to tank the problems for the next few years if we stop spending on stupid things like SIA and businesses (who don't pass on any of the money to their workers anyway) and paying fines to the Indian government because of nonsense investments.
If we keep our country clean, we can open to other clean country.
I've said this before, the "new normal" will be one world split into two, the COVID-free world, and the endemic world, and I don't know why you want to choose the second option.
No, vaccines is not the answer, such a solution doesn't exist.
How long have they been chasing the flu virus, dozens of variations that every flu season need to guess which vaccine is suitable for that place and that time period, and still not 100%.
The COVID vaccine strategy is praying that the virus doesn't mutate faster than the vaccines can catch up, but now with the added handicap of vaccine makers being stubborn and pretending their products can protect more than they really can, and subsequently not making new vaccines and having to go through the whole certification process again and again.
Ho Ching mentioned new potential vaccines that we might be using, Bharat (Covaxin) straight out of the box only 65% vs Delta, and it's only Phase 3 results, not released yet.
Haven't release and fail already, just not fast enough.
It's this failure of seeing the big picture, always wanting to take the easy way out, always thinking about the economy in the short term, that has us going around in circles like that.
Mouth say only, open open open, but the reality is that everyone knows it's unacceptable, NDP postponed, schools closed, dining in banned, dining 2, dining 5, dining banned again, Bloomberg and other countries arm chioing at our fickleness.
oh mai~ clement korkor is a bear type~
 I can offer my services as exercise partner to her.
Exercising with a friend is also more fun, so I hope to keep this up and make it a habit.

All classmates say he is very friendly and soft spoken.
Ended up raped his gf when she wanna breaks up with him.
Then one day he woke up saw his watch is 04.
44am he decided today is the day to kill his gf.
So he waited for her to class by , ask her to patch back.
When she refused he slashed her forty plus times n after she was motionless on the road , he took off the panties n lick the private part n took off his pants n tried to have sex with the corpse in front of public.
No one dares to go up and stop him.

Not many viruses can withstand 100 degrees Celsius.

Need to use mac on kkj thats why got mckkj
Yes will wash thoroughly for hygiene .

that's why after pew liao, must ask the girl to cum your lil bro to clean it.
if you pcc, then you ownself cum your own lil bro to clean it.
Yup, my fb/fwb always suck/lick it clean after every piak piak session with them.
shiok shiok feeling at the head.
Wah some so high?
if one person is already infected.
i thought as in general.
Just take a look at tfr bottom list  nearly all east asians.
most of them are reminded of the hardships growing up in a family with many children
I think, its cultural issue.
Different races in Singapore have very different birth rates and going in different directions.
So whats wrong with east asian culture that create such low birth rates?
Before that they had the highest birth rate rofl
My guess is that young women these days don’t care much about having kids and having a family.
They are more focused on their careers.
38pm is unearthly hour?
His son about to ORD but cannot travel home by himself?
Is her son still bottle fed 3 times a day?

You havent come across ict release from camp at 2359 sharp on a sunday night in a god forsaken part of sg one.
Then mon morning all have to go back to work
Saw on tv, experts claim expect traveling on year end.
Media interview one local girl who claim going to plan go Japan and Thailand this year end.
saw her house seem like stay at orchard rd one of the condo there.
she seem like just 20+ or in early 30s.
This one has rich high SES parent as support.
path already created for her
Go Dome L start listing can alr
Women have multiple paths.
She can be capable and like you work her way to success.
Or she can just marry a successful spouse and take 1/2 with WC.
Today's younger women can even explore "new" paths that are not open to males like sugarbaby and onlyfans.
I guess in life, regardless whether male or female, some will earn more some will earn less.
Comfortable good enough liao, don't need to compare.
nowadays women earning power r higher & faster.
u cant compare gen y/z nowadays.
they got parents with high earning power
Corporate job many CECA and amdk.
U wan them hire local man or young girls
During my internship in CBD, at the dua kee meeting between the head of each departments, moi notice more than half is char bor.
seems like all hold quite high position
Now wonder locals guy feel less confident since local girls earn more than guys.
You comparing to women ofcourse la.
women got so many options last time is gaylang now just do onlyfans or sugar daddy can easily earn more then an average salary comfortably.
not to mention they actually have +2years advantage ….
mani dress sexy can earn more than moi lo.
Standard on IG post photo showing some  cleavage who knows got sponsor come ask how much to promote .
On facebook sell thing also show some  cleavage attract people to see .
Do streaming play game also show some  cleavage.
Want to impress boss every day show some  cleavage make boss happy thus get promote faster.
Charbor earn higher no surprise.
The prettier and sexier earn most.
the 2 year headstart can easily overcome the NS privilege pay.
Yes, very common.
Wife earn more than husband too.
Husband just cruise thru life song song
female privilege in singapore.
taboo topic, nobody spoke about in public
self fulfilling prophercy
You have to play mind games.
But do not gaslight her to a point she questions her sanity.
Do it lightly with a noble purpose of being with her.
I have had countless women in my life.
As a father of 2 teenage girls now, I am ashamed of my past.
But I am what I am.
I try to justify my actions this way: Before marrying, it is an open game.
I am exploring the best options for myself.
DO NOT do this after you are married.
The repercussions are severe.
No questions please.
Just get physical and go with the flow; bed her.
Sometimes after bedding her, the position is still not clear.
Often business contracts fail to materialize because both parties are too busying negotiating - and disagreeing - with the details.
This is the same for relationships.
Why must one make things "official" or ask questions, and in the process ruin everything?
There is no hard and fast rule.
I have asked a lady to "go official" in one date.
I never like this term official and can tell you most ladies do not like it too.
Who likes commitments on something to be enjoyed?
The fastest I got a woman is 1 night, or ONS as they call it.
Typically, it takes me 2-3 weeks to land a lady.
I do not have a number on the times we dated.
On the other extreme, I have "gone official" with another lady only after 2 years.
She was my bff and a married woman with child.
The intent was never to bed her but alas.
It is very hard to resist an attractive married woman.
You stumble yourself by coining the term "official".
Read my previous post.
Do not give the lady the assurances she wants (to keep her wanting more from you).
Here is another sad truth.
I never uttered those infamous 3 words "I love you"  to my gf / wife before marrying her.
last part really meh?
girls can be fickle minded, one moment can agreed with going out with you, the next ghosted u
23 will vert fast become 26, then 30 then 35.
by then too late liao
Confidence is a fine balancing act.
I’ve seen guys trying to portray confidence and ended up looking like a complete asshole.
What u gonna do ?
Plenty of other women you can meet and flirt with
There is group chat for such thing?
Later your wife see u in the group how?
move on liao la
how the girl will know u want to go out with her?
Never say never, op.
Just do not adopt the same mindset as Andy bbfas.
B cups cannot, got tats cannot.
1% cannot, 30+ yo cannot,  hair not long enough cannot, got bf before cannot, a bit of comestic surgery cannot, etc.
like almost everything also cannot.
Good luck and stay safe.
i think one the reason is our sg pool is too low to search a mate, need to explore overseas liao.
quite impressive that chiu can be heypi even with painful imprint in chiur life.
moi also kena stuffs in life that made moi numb riaoz.
sho moi can't be humourous or funny.
juz living life monotonously.
girls usually know what they don't like but struggle with things/people they like or going to like.
but this usually goes away when you encounter older women with more experience, they can tell you what they like and dislike.
When lao kok kok if you rich also can get 18 year olds to sark chiur deek.
Brother, how old ?
Thank you for finding some parts useful.
If your question pertains to morals, not approach, my answer as such.
It is a noble BUT yet un-executable notion to find a life partner without first exploring options, and at the same time, try to be "honest, sincere, loyal and plan future" with every lady you are with.
Read it above again.
One part has to yield.
Yes, you can label it Cheating.
The takeaway is I was not married yet and every one is entitled to explore; in order to find the One.
I don't go in with the intention of wasting her time.
I go in, with the intention of finding out if she is the One.
I admit, some times it is just lust.
I am not perfect.
I do not do it consciously to a lady who has good intentions.
I have a conscience.
At the same time, some ladies just want to have fun.
So nobody is disadvantaged.
Love and dreams
My wife knows I am in that group and very active.
There are lots to be learnt from group sharings.
Their failures, their success.
I dont see anything wrong with it, and most importantly, neither does my wife.
You got to open your mouth to ask.
Do not take rejections personally.
See it this way: At least you asked.
If the answer is No, you can tell yourself at least you have tried and it was not to be.
Seldom will you find girls that will ask you out instead, am I right?
Think of it this way.
I have had ladies ask me out before.
It is very uncomfortable to be someone you don't like.
So I prefer to do the asking, so that i can choose who I like.
Most times, it boils down to gut feel.
When she clicks with you, when the conversations are smooth, you will know it.
Do not make it an "official" date.
It frightens her.
Something like, Hey, you know that famous char kway teow stall you were talking about, I am suddenly craving it.
Lets go eat that tomoro ai mai?
Always do something that interests her, not interest you only.
Like Lets play Mobile Legends.
You know she is not going to be interested.
so got time limit ah walau
The interval u sent and del cannot be too long 
sent picture la.
like regret sending.
better dun send pics in the 1st place?
post it here for us to advise you better.
what kind of pic?
dont tell me mackkj type hor
if not wrong, 2+ hours time limit.
Everyone has seen your nude pic
That’s because you can only delete for everyone within a certain time window.
Try to message and immediately delete for everyone should work
there is a time limit one.
after that time limit,cannot delete for everyone anymore.
maybe you are trying to delete a message past that time limit.
try it on new messages you just posted.
Because you yongsui
Heng moi use telegram
why？ u send your D picture to some one is it?
in before user problem.
There's your answer
but google says if the receiver is using iphone.
the pic will still be in his gallery?
even after i press delete for everyone
yes within 1 hr only
ya telegram i use ok better.
but picture receiver also can download save
Likely phone issue or your whasapp's other parties have to already read ur msg so the option auto disappear lor.
this one i dunno.
but i think for android.
can set whatsapp photos to appear in the phone gallery.
Not sure if that will save the photo in the gallery though.
Never experiment before

In response to essential and front-line workers not having enough places to consume their takeaway food at, many malls are opening up their foodcourts and public places for this purpose (Designated eating areas at malls, extended grace period at carparks, May 23).
Only one diner is allowed per table, which must be placed at least 1m from the next one.
By the same token, why not allow food outlets to resume dine-in service on the same basis, in addition to serving takeaways?
Outlets that are able to rearrange their seating into single-diner tables at least 1m apart should be allowed to resume limited dine-in service in order to supplement their takings from selling takeaway food.
This way, the impact of the recent Covid-19 measures on food outlets can be somewhat cushioned, while less takeaway waste is produced.
Cheng Shoong Tat
i started a thread on this idea already.
and so did many here suggested this move as well.
this Cheng Shoong Tat shud just stuff egg tarts into his mouth/brain
1 diner per table.
perfect for bbfa
Not a bad idea.
One diner per table will just diam diam and eat, not talk until virus fly everywhere.
this is good idea
I have seen people coughing without covering their mouth while eating
Should be like that like having o level exams with some spacing.
Then need to set timer on the seat.
If overtime got alarm sound until the diner leave his seat.
Give it like 1-2 more months lah, should go back to allow dining up to 5 persons liao.
1 diner for essential workers make sense.
One diner one table eat and shout across next table?
Yes, finally can eat hotpot alone without ppl staring
Actually, I also think this is a good idea.
Better for me too since I always ate alone.
BBFA dream is everywhere can solo dining
Lol friend = ts.
Might as well bring prostitute.
See you no up no balls to part the red sea.
Pay for cruise.
Moi is pay for gf cai png niaa.
Somemore curry zup foc
She testing if you are the reliable one but u backstab here.
She has made use of you.
Change another gf
my bro just went cruise with gf.
said super boring due to full of cecas and fts hogging everything.
even pool turned dirty with them in it.
Why you so beh kan?
Others just need a staircase.
Kick her into the sea
after come back cruise can write a similar to legendary shanghai uncle story
On the last night, still no Piak Piak, don't care.
Force yourself on her.
means is floating robert loh
Then you look for cruise waitress  , the singer, the cleaner etc
Nope but in such romantic setting, on international water, should have the feel to piak piak.
It should come as a package you know
Someone needs to initiate I guess.
Did your friend initiate in the first place?
If not, I think the so called r/ship should be reaching the final episode soon.
wah cruise no piak piak, but sleep on bed together?
or cruise, sleep separate rooms?
sry cruise i go 2 are all 1 big bed.
is it a must to piak piak?
cannot sit down and talk meh.
talk abt life, abt future.
sounds like very sore and very loserish.
complain to the gf's mom?
Why you guys go cruise must think so dirty?
I really like your response and the positive attitude.
Running a country is very much like running a sustainability program.
It's not about just doing the right thing, it is about having a system that can replace the depleted resources fast enough so that the system itself can self generate to maintain the current balance.
One must always ask, what balance is this system trying to maintain.
Hahahaha why never treat it as endemic?
Own bank balance lah
Edmw bbfa logic.
1) money can be printed and given freely and unlimited in sg.
2) sg can afford to close itself to the world for the next few years and reopen to see a world full of rainbows  welcoming them with open arms and sg will just pick itself up and lead the world in anything .
3) if it’s not affecting me, it’s not my problem and it will never happen to me
The cases are mainly locals despite 70% fully vaccinated .
Higher vaccination rate than Singapore
U mean OKT PAP.
We are the unwilling prostitutes.
Once they open borders, the infection numbers will sky rocket.
The number of deaths will be a critical indicator on the international level.
If vaccinations are not able to effectively  reduce the number of deaths in the event of new variants, no one would want to come into Singapore.
Then there is the aspect of long-term after effects of covid infection on those who recovered which only they will bare.
These are still relatively unknown and is currently downplayed.
We already have free flow of goods and services.
Why are we so obsessed with the free flow of people.
 We are not as dependent on tourism as Thailand and we have the resources to pivot away from this.
Not like tourism or MICE events are going to come roaring back.
So the obsession is to import more FT and let their bf/gf and whole kampung come in while we citizens suffer the consequences of lockdown and deaths?
Yalor, they must learn from our elite gov.
i believe there is relation in restrictions in travelling  and mental health of people.
It seems like there's a spike in depression and suicide intentions the past year.
I know stories of people who committed suicide as they are unable to travel os - to do business or visit someone.
With this most recent closure it is going to be much worse for locals in phuket and other tourist destinations
well it's fun while it lasted.
where got house 220k so cheap?
TS don't envy for nothing.
Car will devalue the moment he own it.
HDB will appreciate.
Years down the road your hdb will worth more than his car.
dont be sad, your HDB have 9x more lifespan.
still got 3 rm 220k meh
got hdb as cheap as 20k also.
Ur house will value go up by next year, his car will only depreciate.

Never buy fish from market .
Will rather buy from ntuc.

Why you go so early
Don't buy prawns near CNY.
Those in the mkt right now most of them have been kept in fridge for mths not fresh at all.
Fresh only for farmed.
Wild caught seafood .

Want very fresh go Jurong Fishery port at 2am and buy.
Go to geylang serai.
Got many seafood stalls there
Freshness is v important especially for those who eat prawn noodles.
I have no car n time to travel there not worth it as I am staying at east side.
Last year I used to stock up fresh seafood 1 month in advance as pricing would be lower than CNy .
this year bo time to go market till today.

Ownself go home cannot?
The usual self entitlement mindset.

Chiu all should know the different scenarios when they cannot release people even when there ish parents waiting outsai huan.
Regulars ish also huan to go home early huan.
First time seeing this Milestone Parade.
How to go back home after midnight when the public transport has ceased.
Route march home or stay in, choose one.
Commanders say "find ur own transport", before driving home in their continental cars.
For young regular, it's Japanese car.

Sinkie regular pwn sinkie civilian.
Tonite can sleep well

Good luck to her son's future spouse.
War time will have knock off timing and also will never have unexpected circumstances one.
I can imagine next time this kind of son married liao still need parents teach how to fahk the girl.
buy a car today, sell tomorrow chow chow lose 30% value.
Your HDB flat value might appreciate tomorrow.

TS want to do at balcony?
Dump the body off the cruise no?

Cheaper to just go Geylang and pay $150.
She was in a different cabin from you?
golden rule is to tps first before you invest in her.
if you cannot tps her, then don't waste money on her.
No piak piak at least must get a bj ask her to swallow.
1 cuise for 2 is about $1.
9k for a decent balcony room.

anyway is same cabin
Small size wild caught prawns between $16-18 per kg
Things r exp in kovan wet market.
But one vege stall is so much cheaper around fruit stall, one old uncle is selling)  than the usually stall which has many customers flooding to buy from the stall (fat uncle wearing huge gold chain).
Boon Keng market I went before.
30am++++ not even stalls opened or ready!
Amk 631 wet market opens very early one.
Usually 8+am not much fish left liao
thank for the inform.
will relate to my mum.
but doubt she will go
I saw giant $15 the prawns very big.
Same for cold storage
now few or no fishermen outside catching.
so where or when you think the seafood has been coming.
most fishmongers would have sold out by Saturday morning.
you guys better buy before then.
else go battle and fight it out at super markets.
Ah soo mkt have better choices.
Kovan quite cut throat
buy from elsewhere
Is it compulsory?
I personally don't have any except for a hospitalization plan for emergencies paid via Medisave.
Are those monthly insurance plan, e.
endowment or whatever paid monthly  really needed  ?
 or just a con job by the insurers  
u can go read up .
but most importantly insurance is not investment.
Bottomline: medical/health, home fire - yes.
Endowment, investment linked, others - only if you got spare cash to throw
Can always go yolo mentality
Why u ask here?
Must get hospitalisation, term and critical illness.
Rest is optional.
Early critical illness and cancer coverage is depends on your family history also.
Endowment is good if you want to not hands on investing.
Returns is dependent on market conditions but is usually 4% for mid to long term.
Yes worth it only idiot don't buy
Got family yes very impt.
If bbfa just buy enough to support parents in old age.
Depends on how much you tolerate uncertainty.
Insurance is pretty much exchanging the uncertainty of a large loss for the certainty of a small loss.
Insurance damn important.
Need satki insurance Scums to help you sign on the dotted line.
if something happens and you need it, - Yay.
if nothing happens then you dun need it - Nay.
it all depends on individual and affordability.
that's his revenue.
so what's his net profit?

Hope he sell Rolex lelong lelong.
sorry, is wang lei by any chance WLH relative ah?

can sic the group?
For me, my dad was a violent man with a nasty temper.
My mom is a gambling addict.
Every night they fought.
Sometimes with knives.
Invariably, in their quarrels, they cited their failing marriage on having kids.
I interpreted that to mean - me.
That I am the cause of their angst.
It made me suicidal.
I attempted suicide several times.
I would cut my wrist.
You see, the only escape for me then was Laughter.
I had to make light of situations.
If I were to analyze everything seriously, I would have succeeded in my suicide attempts or lose it mentally.
 So I was "trained" from young to be humorous.
I suggest you find an escape for yourself.
If you keep things bottled up inside, you will one day go berserk when the volcano inside you erupts.
Try to find a meaning to life.
I found mine in religion.
Because no one cared about me, it was a comforting feeling knowing that someone up there does.
TS at your age is considered young.
But before you get into a relationship you need to understand a few things.
There is no perfect girl, just like us there are no perfect men.
You will have certain criteria that you think you will like to have in your dream girl but most of the time, when you get a girlfriend, you will realise that your girlfriend is nothing like your dream girl.
Many times we don't even know what kind of girls we like, except for the general norm - pretty face, good figure, big breast, sweet etc.
What you need to do is to know more people.
I know it is tough during this period where many outdoor activities are unlikely.
Knowing more people is good coz you make new friends and if your personality is good enough, these new friends may introduce your future girlfriend to you.
Join interest groups that you like, be it cycling, hiking, nature, dancing, art, sports whatever.
 Joining charity and volunteering groups and events can be an option.
The point is know more friends and spend your time meaningfully.
Be nice, be friendly and be sincere.
Join the interest groups via Facebook and Telegram now.
It is on wechat.
PM me your wechat id.
I will add you.
Btw, it is a group for divorced / sexless marriage / troubled relationships.
If you are in neither categories, you will not resonate with the contents.
instead of trying to find love, why not do what you love to do .
from there you might find someone with same hobbies like yourself.
i was 30+ when i had a failed relationship .
went traveling (like an emo bbfa) and that was when i met my current wife who was also single and we didn't expect to find love outside SG .
she is also singaporean .
we met each other during our oversea trips .
and found out she and me have some similar hobbies .
badminton, anime, traveling, eating jap food etc.
TS, work hard, improve yourself, buy a EV car, go out more, things will change.
Thanks for your honest and real sharing.
Sounds like you had a rough childhood but life has offered you lots of female warmth to make up for it .
What you shared about getting women makes a lot of sense, from my observations and personal experiences.
I find there are a lot of single guys here who are bitter and it's very sad because, there's actually a way out for them, as people like yourself and a few others have generously shared.
But many prefer to justify why they cannot find a partner, rather than taking the effort to actually change themselves to improve their chances of success.
im 30 this year.
just ended my first relationship.
TS, you still have a long way to go.
Know what you really want and save yourself some heartbreaks.
I honestly don't think it is hard for you to find love in this lifetime.
But I think it is going to be hard for you to find the love you think you deserve.
in before edmwers come and ask u liao.
If I may speak on MLY's behalf, I don't think he means that he is constantly 'advertising' himself to find the next better buyer.
But rather, it's important that his wife understands that he has options.
It doesn't mean he's looking to bail at the first opportunity.
But he can if he had too.
And it probably, it should work the other way too.
Who wants to be with someone whom nobody else wants?
Yeah good advice, just go overseas and do what you like.
I will think about settling when I am 35  
But how do you know what is the love that he thinks he deserves?
Love yourself is the most important.
I am always planning something for myself.
Eg where to eat.
I always have something to look forward to.
Right now , i am planning and still deciding if i should go to Ce La Vi at the month end.
Im going alone , and i know i will still enjoy myself .
Dont need to be emo about single
Totally agree with this point.
For me, once I get the vibe of being unwanted, I start seeking other options and try to detach myself emotionally.
Not sure if I'm sick in the head but it beats getting hurt, I'd rather be the first to leave.
Some times, what appears to be a blessing - the ease I get women - manifests as a curse, in the long run.
You see me good, I see you good.
You nailed the problem in the last para.
Yes, many here are sceptical and cynical about women.
Hence they conclude erroneously  that the problem is with Sg women, not them.
This is nothing.
That GC I alluded to has 300 people putting the blame on their partners.
She is not providing sex after the childbirth.
My hubby is seeing another women.
My wife displays no interest in our marriage.
He is not providing for the family etc.
The list goes on and on.
Only 2 out of 300 were cognizant to recognise that the problem is actually with themselves.
They screwed up.
Not their partner.
Imagine counseling such a group!
Micheal Jackson said it best in his song.
The problem is always with the man in the mirror.
If you want to make the world - or your relationships - a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change.
You can't change the bbfa here.
But you can change yourself and make life sweeter for yourself.
Vivi considered suay ?
Many times is beh kan.

The 4-year molest case in the news ah,.
It shows that female sales reps for those pharma companies have dangerous occupational risk, doesn't it ?
They go inside doctor's room, then need to charm and beguile the doctor to buy their products, otherwise they don't hit the sales target.
Maybe they need to do certain things, use their sex appeal, and maybe they become victims to sexual harassment.
I think it's a tough job.
What do you think ?
i was in a private clinic.
wah the way the pharma sales rep dress up, really is dress to kill one.
i think she was promoting viagra or cialis or something.
at least she was way more entertaining to look at than the her world magazines.
after that i asked the doctor about her.
and he said see so many naked people already.
no fweeling haha
Its common practice in pharma trade.
But the money’s good.
Once doctor sign to order you drugs, the order will keep coming in.
Do 1 time only but sales is continuous
Nv been an officer b4.

u see those MIW rast time serve OCS, now they rook tough anot?
Give me $ I also don't wan go.
Ocs is tough in a way that its very demanding schedule can wear your brain out.
Very little sleep and a lot of things to do.
Whole day like OT 18 hours kind.
Physical is ok cos can condition body.
It’s different from BMT whereby after night snack u can relax etc and have 7 hours of sleep.
Ocs first term is very mentally demanding.
those that get posted to 2nd term infantry is the most siong lol.
9 months stressing the brain and body out
I think like with most vocations, it's not really physically tough if you are fit.
May be my batch was different, cos we had a batch mate who was the son of a vvip, from bmt to ocs.
so my friend hired a servant last year, to do cleaning etc.
the servant at the start say until very good, will do work wholeheartedly, make sure my friend happy with her work.
few months down, she become demanding, ask for more pay, complain that my friend make the house dirty and not because she never clean.
you all say what to do with her?
Bro can share servant ig?
It's called helper.
simi ig you want 
Ur fwen considered lucky Liao.

SINGAPORE - Sports programmes for children and seniors have been halted temporarily, national agency Sport Singapore (SportSG) announced on Tuesday (Sept 28).
In a circular to members of its ActiveSG platform, SportSG said that all programmes catering to children aged 12 and below will be suspended until Oct 10.
Programmes organised by ActiveSG for seniors - those 60 and above - will be suspended until Oct 24.
The measures come on the back of the Government's announcement on Sept 24 of the shift to a stabilisation phase of the nation's transition to Covid-19 resilience.
In addition to the suspension of activities, SportSG also said that while dual-use scheme (DUS) sports facilities remain open, users will be required to adhere to a reduction in number participants allowed.
For DUS indoor sports halls, only two people - inclusive of a coach - are allowed on each badminton court, down from five.
For team sports like netball, volleyball, basketball and floor ball, only two people - inclusive of a coach - are allowed per half court, also down from five.
For DUS school fields, up to 50 participants are allowed at any one time, but they can only be in pairs.
For users of all DUS facilities, participants are required to maintain two metres' safe distancing between individuals and 3m between pairs.
SportSG also reminded ActiveSG members to ensure they and their group members are fully-vaccinated before booking any DUS indoor sports halls, as a mandatory verification of vaccination record is also in place.
you dont see ugly or fat people complain about discrimination.
its always them blackies
sometimes it's not the color but their aloof attitude & their self entitled nature.
no need to guess which country folks.
i isn can understand the frustration of these gheys.
If they are from minority and worse their community ish traditional and no accept homosexuals.
They hab difficulty finding parters from the same race.
The new trend that’s coming up now is referring to Asians as urine due to the color of it.
1st world problem.
ownself partner is ownself choose de, nao chiu telling moi cannot choose?
because chiu will be offended it's coz of chiur race?
chiu die die huan force dem be wit chiu?
At least the chinese girls don't discriminate
Everything also racist.
Cannot have preference meh.
while they themselves also hiam 3 hiam 4 wat .
"No chubs, no older than 40 yo, no sissies.
Only whites have no negative associations with their skin colour, they must be the true master race
White is considered purity.
Anything else is coloured.
Gay also racist ?
I thought they spread love and anti-discrimination.
melissa zeh zeh?
prostitutes/FLs also can choose clients, no say them racists?
knn self entitled farkers
That's what they would have you think.
Useless thread without poloboiboi and Adam Lambert
These people really is in higher realms.
self titled 9696
Thats what you said and what you keep inside your heart
The channel inside alot AMDL.
You have put it correctly lol
I'm a SSFA auntie living alone.
waiting to die and let neighbours smell my rotten corpse 
Yes you have rightly said so.
My traumatic childhood shaped my dating views.
I can't change my past.
At one stage, I churned women to hurt them.
Because I was hurt by women and my parents failed marriage.
Fortunately that thinking was short lived and I snapped out of it.
As to the unstable relationships, I can understand you cannot accept such a situation.
This is not postulated by me from theories.
It is life's practical lessons.
This is how the game is played.
You only get stability AFTER you marry.
Before that, each has a choice to end it.
She has a free choice.
You may want it badly.
She can bail out any time she wants.
This is what my first gf taught me.
I dated her 7 years.
Was so sure she was the One.
Gave her all assurances I will always love her (how stupid was i?
) Even proposed to her.
She balked at the idea.
Eventually she saw a banker colleague.
She is a banker.
Didn't even have the courtesy to tell me we were off.
Because I was too predictable.
Nothing hooks a lady more than a thriving romance.
Of attraction and uncertainty.
Watch some Korean dramas to understand why
Well since we can't help the BBFAs maybe we can help the SSFA auntie .
Tell us more about yourself, what are you looking for?
BBFA here, waiting for RCP to save me from my own BBFA-ness
This thread is so funny.
10 years of courtship, married since YR2001; a total of 30 years.
Was a bui bui 30 years ago.
Instead of subjecting your neighbours to smell your rotten corpse, why not sacrifice your body to do some charitable work before you go.
You know, mask up, meet up and let it be a sweet night for an anonymous bbfa here.
No one has to remember anything the next day if they don't want to.
You will definitely make his day!
And maybe yours hehe 
in the end how u get ur waifu?
chop chop settle within 2year of courtship?
My waifu is my 2nd "official" gf.
If there is such a thing as official haha.
I knew her in uni.
She is a private banker.
Dated her 9 years.
We are now married 21 years and have 4 kids.
i only started to date when i was 24, married to my ex-wife when i was 29 only for her to cheat on me 4 years later.
trust me, the pain of that was worse than not having a relationship.
How did you find out?
So young wanna get married liao?
Later age 30 divorce and get pawn by wc every month pay maintenance
But you got eat outside these 21 years right?
One of the greatest lie society has taught you is that you need to "find love" in order to be happy and have a fulfilling life.
i see that there's something wrong with your mindset.
There is no such thing as 'this lifetime, next lifetime'.
This lifetime is all we get.
I want to eat outside.
Like restaurant food, hope the gal comes along
23 year old only .
still bery yang.
nothing wrong with bbfa.
but u wan to court girls as a bbfa then good luck.
dun say u dun have choices as a bbfa u have but most likely u will end up as another average couple .
the choice is urs u can change if u wan to change.
if not dun complain
I dont think i ever complained about being alone  im actually enjoying it.
Im already planning where to go next at month end.
Going alone most likely to Ce La Ve.
Or maybe a change of venue at last min.
No matter where i go alone, im confident i will still enjoy myself.
came in and left disappointed.
i was expecting step sister stuck in washing machine
Some folks wanted to buy oximeters bcos their parents lost their flyers.
Others didn’t want to collect as they had already gotten their own oximeters last year.
Yet others want to make some money selling their free oximeters from Temasek Foundation.
** Where to buy?
Temasek Foundation have no plans to sell its oximeters.
Those who wish to have extra oximeters, may consider buying online, from Lazada, Shopee, Qoo10, or even Carousell.
Various common brands would go from under $10 to around $30.
For the rest who have their flyers, collection of free oximeters is over a month from day before yesterday Monday 5 July, to Thursday 5 August just before National Day.
** Where to collect?
These may be collected by presenting your flyer, with the redemption tab, or just use the redemption tab, at the participating outlets at:.
Just present your flyer or redemption tab to any cashier at these outlets.
The cashier will scan and retain the redemption tab, and give you the free oximeter.
The scanning is linked to the warehouse system so that the participating chains know when to send top up supply.
The physical tab is kept as part of quick audit for reconciliation.
Yup, there is sometimes a method in our madness!
Around 300 outlets in total - not all outlets could participate, as some are quite small and do not have the space to carry inventory.
If the outlet doesn’t have, or has run out for the day, just pop in to other nearby outlets or come back another day.
The Prime Supermarket folks have also reached out to see if they could help with the free collection.
Big thanks to them for their interest to help.
Temasek Foundation folks are working with them to see if they can come on board in the next week or so.
** Didn’t get your flyer?
For those who haven’t received their flyers, please call 1800 738 2000 to leave your name, contact number and address.
These cases will be escalated to SingPost for further checks.
Yah, there are some folks who try to get extra oximeters to make more pocket money on Carousell.
Selling on Carousell is fine - others who need them could buy them from Carousell or buy others from other online platforms.
The flyers don’t look like some spam mail from property agents, right?
But trying to scam the Temasek Foundation folks is not fine.
Those who genuinely had a problem can called 1800 738 2000 to leave their name, contact number, and address.
The call centre will pass on to the Temasek Foundation folks, who will evaluate and contact the affected folks in the next couple of weeks.
For cases of non delivery, the folks will escalate to SingPost to check and rectify if needed.
No promises, but I know the Temasek Foundation folks and others helping will do their best.
They are good hearted and thoughtful folks who are trying their best to help others wherever they can, esp during this Covid pandemic.
**What will Temasek Foundation do with any balance oximeters after 5 Aug?
A small balance will be kept to enable exchange for any faulty oximeters up till end August.
The balance will be donated to MOE for distribution to students, teachers and staff, in schools.
So don’t worry about balances with Temasek Foundation, hor?
They will all be put it to good use for others.
Temasek Foundation had been donating oximeters to places like nursing homes for seniors in Singapore, and to other countries since last year.
So this is just a Stay Prepared initiative:.
- to help people learn more about the risk of silent Covid pneumonia;.
- learn to use an oximeter;.
- to familiarise ourselves with our own levels of oxygen intake so we know when to get help.
** What to do if you have a faulty oximeter?
Just go to the Temasek Shophouse during operating hours, and bring along your oximeter with its box and other items in the box.
One lady did that, and was so happy!
Turned out her oximeter was in perfect working order.
It was just batteries not working.
Replace batteries, and she took her own readings.
Happiness beamed from her big bright smile!
And the team cheered!
** What else to watch out for?
The next Stay Prepared exercise will be for disposable medical grade surgical masks, and disposable N95 masks.
Watch for news after National Day.
After that, it will be another for povidone iodine (aka PVP-I) mouth gargle, which could be used as mouth spray.
This is currently planned for Sep/Oct period.
More about these after National Day.
That’s all, folks.
Cannot just say local dun want.
pls refer to our population ratio.
Actually you can get online with free shipping for < $15.
How would anyone want to make few dollars selling the Temasek ones?
This is not newsworthy.
An MRT trip to and flo to collect from any place would already cost $4-$5.
Ownself earn sky high salaries.
Her entire family salary also paid by tax payers leh.
Don’t see her feel paiseh about it
someone once said, what's wrong with collecting more money.
change collecting to earning is same same
earn some dignity, got wrong?
am not surprised.
if ordinary SG folks are rich enough, will we have to resort to this?
People give free things that you don't need, why no sell?
Or only can buy high sell low?
If house rent out, tenant can collect?
Die liao die liao.
carousell kenna mark liao
Those who extra not scare kena shame meh.
Who starts the ball rolling n everything abt $$$ (GDP)?
Temasek Foundation money come from where?
I feel they should be contributing more $$$ to our govt to spend on citizens rather than this marketing exercise.
Sinkies are always pawning sinkies
So much of talk from Empress Dowager Cixi.
Power is an infinite element.
When the old man was alive, where was she?
If she was to place her son as the third generation PM of this country, it would spell the end of Singapore.
Ensuing in its path would be doom.
Singaporeans really cheapskate.
people give u free u don’t need then u collect and resell.
if u have proper morales u can list it for $0 so people who need it can obtain it without cost as it was provided to u without charge either.
Or better yet, just don’t collect.
I’m sure the organisers can find a way to donate the remaining to needy users
Front grill like become smaller
Too little power leh.
My current car already 6s to 100kmph and i find it low power
can easily stage 1 it to 230 bhp.
with the kind of body size and weight anything below 210 bhp and low torque is under power.
cries at the price
The emblem on the hood will be retained?
If want to buy E class, should buy at least E250, E300.
a bit overpriced because is a new model, but c&c does offer high trade in so the effective price could be just arounf $250K range.

If you must know
i buy godiva truffles for special occasions rah.
1 piece $6 or what i think.
Then how to rebuild?
Those cmi JC or strawberry poly are the worst.
I remember most of the cb ns sergeant from there one.
OCS all the cmi leaders one and most likely help one another.
During my time they always claim that sispec is more siong than ocs.
Not sure abt it cos I’m just lowly cpl lol
Not true, it depends if the company is officer-led or warrant officer-led.
OCS is mostly mental torture/training after 1st term.
SISPEC/SCS is alot more physical and training to work as a section/platoon.
IMHO SISPEC/SCS trains u better rather than OCS.
occifer only thinks abt themselves
He use the wrong term lah.
But the gist of the message is still there.
There is very few things the recruit need to huan loh after last parade.
The most is work on fitness or ask ur bunkmate for help if u slow learn for things like tech handling test or do thing like smartest 4 or shiny kiwi boots if u very on.
reservist until 55 yrs old.
no OCS one 40 yrs old
OCS quite nua one, probably the toughest part for me was rifle cleaning into the early morning before u are allowed to sleep after field camp lol.
very relax one lei.
not commando lei.
u tell me tough ki lan.
even sgd cdo also not siong one
Their training not suitable for us BBFAs la
Ah yes, now that you put it this way, I can agree with you.
Actually, during NS, being a sergeant/officer is a real pain in the arse because you cannot just let go after last parade.
What’s the biggest heartland in Singapore ?
I am staying in 4Room HDB.
2021 property tax was about $64.
Just received my property tax for 2022 and I have to pay about $86!
Tat is an INCREASED OF ABOUT 34%!
did u vote for the right party?
Definitely not them
Omg $12 cannot afford.
$1 more a month.
What’s the annual value of your house
My property taxes over 5k per year.
Who you have voted for first?
why pay extra tax to feed the filthy pap
well everyone loves it ma.
no evidence to say anyone is against it.
no one asked for apology either.
wah kao property tax so low still come here complain
So when increase rent and selling price of your property nobody publish on newspapers that they earn so much
Technically it is $22 more and not $12
My parents 5room.
About 28% increased.
I don seemed our pay also up that much lor.
That makes $1.
80 more a month.
The whole family of 10 is going to starve to death.
Your pay increase yearly?
Because property tax dun
I am just pointing out your miscalculation.
Did I say anything about the increase?
Inflation occurred yearly too.
With covid , many co freeze wages increment lor
By % really a lot!
Did our property went up so much ?
Normal as in not those super rich or with powers (like rule a country.
He is really most satki right now.
USA with all its might cant even do anything to him.
They can only bang their own balls for letting him slip out of the country.
Can't even do anything Russia other than making noise.
Why would USA do anything to its own cia agent spy?
I think jho low is the most satki, now where also don't know.
Snowden, an american with conscience ~
The damage is done liao.
What is the point of chasing him?
And cannot be like everyday go send people to say he liar and everything he say is propaganda right?
He's still young, long life in front of him.
He's going to slip up one day, then he will find himself forever in an american prison.
Could be a spy for US.
 The revealation of US gov spying on its own citizens could be a guise to get other country to accept him.
Spy World can be very complicated.
now there's people labeling him as a spy.
 lol America is full of low life nonsense
If he went to UK like other guy, then gong xi gong xi.
You are referring to the wikileaks assange?
Yeah, now rotting indefinitely in uk prison.
Live in Russia shiok meh?
He how to live survive.
His money from where.
He living which country now
I think the russian will not trust snowden too.
He is there seeking a shelter, all it takes to putin to warm up to biden or whoever with the intent to bring snowden back to the US shore, snowden is a goner.
Snowden is a great bargaining chip for putin.
He probably still have CIA secrets, thats why the russian are still providing a safe haven for him.
nithing wrong with making $$.
is the ceca in me.
pap tell us to integrate wat ~
What's wrong with making money?
Apparently there’s a different between something you have already collecting every month as norm, vs something you just started to collect it the first time.
Dun say like that lar.
The reverse also got where those people bought new item realize no use and give out FREE.
Can see this in scratchback.
This is especially apparent for those unfortunate biz venture, where the biz owner give free stocks.
So is one rice feed all walks of live case, not all as cheapskate as bro thought one.
Maybe it's not Singaporeans?
Now Singaporean core contains CECAs
Trying to deflect from her stupid decision to use flyers.
Like opening a pandora box.
Just give back some of our taxes and we can decide what is important for us.
Many may need groceries to survive in a pandemic than to have an oximeter.
Saw one flyer lying on top of my mailbox.
No sg team right.

take part in community work at the cc.
take part in charity or volunteer work.
take part in your religion community work.
be more outgoing and join cycling or running clubs.
I believe all of the above you never do.
I got to know my atb through community voluntary work during Christmas period in Orchard Rd.
There were two other girls who were interested in me.
I am plump and I walk with a little limp.
If I can find a gf, why you can't.
I don't understand.
The reason you write this already proves that you are not going to do something about it.

How I wish I had your age.
bro, love yourself first.
SINGAPORE - Getting a booster shot with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccine further reduces the risk of infection by over 60 per cent.
Those who had taken a Moderna booster shot after two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech saw a further reduction in infection risk by 72 per cent, while those who took a Pfizer booster shot after two jabs of the Pfizer vaccine saw a 62 per cent reduction.
The statistics was shared by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Monday evening (Nov 15) at a virtual press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19.
He said that the Health Ministry had recently done a study on the relative effectiveness of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as booster shots in terms of reducing infection risk, and compared the two combinations.
One possible combination is three consecutive shots of the Pfizer vaccine (two regular jabs and one booster) while the other combination is a Moderna shot after two regular doses of the Pfizer jab.
Mr Ong noted that results for other combinations, such as a Pfizer shot after two doses of Moderna jabs, do not have large sample sizes and hence may not yield meaningful statistics.
Mr Ong and Singapore's director of medical services Kenneth Mak both took the Moderna shot after two jabs of the Pfizer vaccine.
Mr Ong also explained why Singapore's reported vaccine coverage of 85 per cent appears to be lower than the reported figures in some other countries.
"This is because some countries report vaccine coverage against the eligible population, whereas we report vaccine coverage against the total population," he said.
This means that of the remaining 15 per cent who are not vaccinated, 1 per cent of them are not living in Singapore, 9 per cent are children below 12 and not eligible, and the remaining 5 per cent are eligible but chose not to be vaccinated, he added.
"So if we recalculate this based on eligible population, we are around 94 per cent vaccinated.
It is one of the highest coverages in the world.
MOH will provide both figures henceforth in our daily press release to give a fuller picture of the progress of our vaccination exercise," Mr Ong said.
Which has higher risk ?
Two Pfizer + Moderna booster seems to be the most effective combination.
I went with Pfizer for the booster though as the earlier two shots of Pfizer had no side effects.
 Ditto for the booster.
 Other than slight soreness in the arm for a day.
Not going to get booster
why never study MM + P and MM + M?
Compared with 3 doses of moderna how?
OYK was correct~  
Sinovac/Sinopharm still trying to play catchup to mRNA 2 jabs with 100 jabs of their own.
i discussed with some ppl they all agree the thing is if u have p p or m m and have no side effect its no guarantee the third different shot wont give u problem?
if u want to play it safe get p p p or m m m, if u want better protection but must accept more risk then take the mix?
of cos this is not saying take it p p p or m m m will be 100% safe either?
WTF Sino x 2 + Pfizer = 95%.
POFMA WANBAO NAO!
Doesn't matter which combination to take, all will end up killing you.
How about unvax with zero jabs?
so MM is too strong no need boost?
if your body already familiar with PP or MM.
better go with PPP or MMM.
why risk it with something your body might have an adverse reaction to?
No matter what combination, Died alryd means got underlying.
End up still will get even thought paper specs say until got hill got mountain.
So that Big Pharma can collect more data as the vaccines are still in the Phase 3 trail.
Same but with mild chest pain.
My friends who took Moderna all complained of much more severe pain.
Not gonna die pain lah, but more pain than I felt.
So I rather stick with Pfizer.
Plus I had my annual flu jab too.
But those who prefer lighter skinned partners are also racist wat, why they don't choose their own same skin fellow 
Don't like move on lor, why must kpkb online?
I don't get it.
You kpkb online these people will say sorry, change to 'all race welcome'?
I always say ceca here will make problem, and as the number and power grow.
The more they will make demands,
Curryna Huat am moi reading?
LGBT also want to complain about racism.
it's the pot calling the kettle black
Do you see anything peaceful in south asia?
Why u expect they will be peaceful when the number grow?
U cant even call them india anymore
It is preference definitely .
however, nwadays there are certain groups of ppl who likes to stir preference into something esle.
These stir-ers are those who made US into what it is today.
Because for some dumb reason minorities can't be called racist.
same in parliament 
And a lot of our younger generation are being brain washed by such thinking
And u call yellow as urine.
its what inside your heart
gotta agree that it's not abt racism, just personal preference.
like a marriage, ppl here mostly wld find someone of their own skin anw, not outside the circle .
latter still few & far between i.
I am totally okay if Indians, Germans , French, Africans don’t want to date me.
I wouldn’t even think it’s racist.
Minority of the minority
Then landlord state prefer certain nationality as tenant also racist.
If a few people don't like you then is racist.
If everyone don't like you hor, u better look inwards
Just making a comparison but you seem triggered.
I guess it got to you.
As much as I wouldn’t want to rupture further nerves on your end, my point is made.
Simi Sai also racist.
This SJW nonsense getting out of hand
in ghey world is full of discrimination.
if u are not muscular with good looks and young, u will be discriminated
Do we even have Cathrynli simps in EDMW?
Next time ask atb to dress up in wonderwoman costume n piak

M'sian influencer Cathryn Li shares photo of suicide attempt on Instagram, deletes post shortly after.
Saw her very big expensive house.
Dunno what is she upset about.
So rich and chio and still got mental issues.
little bit explode riao, very draining for sure.
This one is fake one
no gal gadot no talk
I dunno much about her.

Or she got very good earning power ?
She seems to be single.

Ever managed to find in Thai but think they discontinued.
Not really a chocolate person but I will occasionally eat:.

But its really expwnsive so only once a while buy treat moi self.
Must hide awat frm kids 
Reminds me of my childhood dayZZZ  
My childhood favourite.
But I feel not easy to find.

chocolate origin not bad right?
their dark chocolate cake and their soft serve
Edmw bbfa like van houten
They can use CPF to buy one 2 room apartment and no more mthly, still own the place, can sell later but instead choose pay 2k for a rental unit to live independently from parents
we need more of such poor financial decision to support our property market.
good for landlords.
and property prices.
So let them be.
if they dont heed ur advice.
just be on the winning side.
how many such people in 30s renting?
heppi can riao.
Those 30+ ppl still hope to merry wifey and apply BTOs next time.
Wont waste their time buy a 2rm when single since it will only make potential charbors hiam their low ses status.
Better rent 2k condo to attract potential wifey to piak and preggy for marriage
Building flat is long term lease too
Yes terrible decision.
Like that then can support rental market.
Support rental market means supporting your property values
Analyst will tell you to rent and invest surplus money that will give you better returns than buying property.
i know someone who rent condo while waiting for a bto because his wife can't stand living with his parents.
lots of people with different circumstances la.
I'm not sure if you actually did the calculation of buying vs renting.
At current price point, I actually think renting is more worth it.
Save the ultra big downpayment.
Renting is cheaper than instalment + maintenance fee + maintenance of house.
Forgo interest earned (assuming 1+2 from CPF).
Last year I checked (not now), renting a 4 bedder condo is $3.
8k in renovation and very good condition.
Instalment for that house is $4k+, downpayment few hundred thousands.
ps: if you are comparing with a 2 room BTO, then this calculation won't work though one needs to wait for a few years to get one.
35 years old + 5 years waiting = 40 years old then get to move out.
They have the money to waste
You have to understand, only those 35 years of age and above can buy a flat using cpf.
Many are in their early 30s and still single and they don't want to live with parents, so no choice but to rent an apartment.
1 room apartment easily cost 2k already
condo got all the facilities leh
they happy ish can riao
people got money.
some people even make that amount in less than couple of hours in the stock market.
more than what u make a month
these guys are good for property market as it only increases demand for property.
when demand goes up and supply remain constant, its huat time.
If full serviced apartment then maybe it's worth it.
ok some people dont think like some people.
If ftcan afford it why Sinkies cannot?
IB can't count properly no wonder degenerate to be an IB
Mine went from $1,980 to $2,040, but annual rental yield increased by $2.
4k this year, so not so bad.
Actually less after adjusting for inflation.
This is nothing compared to petrol tax.
My mum just handed me the property tax letter.
My week long salary not enough to pay.
It makes it so much different
To me we could still afford the increased.
imagine those low income families , jobless sole bread winners and so on.
a few dollars to them is a lot of money.
I am jobless and stress over this increase now.
actually  I Also never rent out leh.
why increase huh?
the valuation thingy is based on U rent out right
So fast come in liao?
It just makes you look like you can't do simple math
The point is if u are stuck in a dead end job with nowhere to go and only suffer such expenses increase, look at the mirror and ask why.
Tks for pointing that out.
Why shld company give u increment if u do the same job year in year out?
Taxi business is really bad.
I heard from my cousin who is taxi driver (60+ years old)  too.
He told me many drivers returned their car to co (early retirement or not worth driving now as need as earning not even enough to cover rental, carpark and petrol) .
Some wait for economic to be better than drive taxi again.
Occupier property tax is a huge reduction from actual.
look at the Gov tax collection.
37 million households in Singapore.
now multiply by $22 increase.
And 100% are owner occupied.
that is more than $30 million of EXTRA taxes collected.
lOw SES NON matured estate leh
How much this new fit/jazz thing?
Design getting worst
freed ish better
For the same generation, swift more Chio and got turbo?
I feel this design is more catered towards women.
The car in real, i fins it not bad looking leh
Cos satki black vios better
Most top up and buy conti hatchback le
As per the post after.
Lots more option with alternative.
If you are looking for a car, lots of choices.
Then why a fit/jazz?
85k are those few options nia.
wtf look damn fugly.
too girlish liao
shld be the new 1.
5L jazz right for that pricing.
Anyways feel the design very jap/minimalist style.
is more expensive than previous gen
Cos everybody driving honda Vezel , no time for fit
Cos the previous model looks nicer and more sporty.
The new FIT looks guniang
Waaaa Aunt Dino, you no reason suan me zuo mo?
I was just replying someone's claims that guys have to be tall handsome and rich to have pretty gf.
I opined its not true because I am neither tall handsome and rich.
But hor, if you really want to hold my hand, we can discuss lah >.
1) frequently working late.
2) bringing phone into toilet (it was not smartphone era; back then we were all using sms to text).
3) becoming distant; next to no intimacy.
4) saw her coming out of a guy's car at a very unusual location far beyond the normal drop off at our home.
I trusted my intuition, asked for divorce.
she got pregnant a couple of months after our divorce was finalised.
lets not blame each other, both sides have their own expectations.
Never suan lah, ask ask only.
You ownself know what to do can liao.
Btw never saw you for months.
Sorry, I don't hold the hands of attached guys  
Thought I was replying a guy.
Nowadays got many guys use cutesy nicks.
Sorry, I should have framed my answers better!
Like the movie The Legend?
But ya lorrrr 23 years old only.
Out of curiosity, when did all these start happening?
Any red flags before you got married which you thought nothing of?
Gotta agree intuition most of the time is right, something must have happened to make you think that way.
At least you're better off now without her.
I very disappointed in u ah.
Ask you be my gf dun want.
Now complain you same situation as ts!
thank you sir, hope for the best for you too
i think it was a period when my career wasn't that promising, i was struggling.
To be honest, there wasn't red flag prior to that.
it just went south suddenly.
Yes, taller people have advantages.
But that does not mean all is lost.
Read my posts here.
Edit: btw I know a 1.
9m guy in his late 30s that have not dated before no matter how much he wants to.
The girls tell me he is stubborn and socially awkward.
Height is not everything my friend.
wah this read still going wor.
For guys , height is of the most important trait honestly.
That is one of the trait people judge you at the first initial appearance.
Shorter guy just look meek , weak and physically unattractive whereas Taller guy are just much more confidence and attractive.
It is much far worst to be a SSFA than to be a BBFA.
At least with dedication and hard work , weight can still decrease and can still slim down in the most natural way.
But for height increment , without going through the painful limb lengthening surgery , even if you have 10000 billions of net worth there is no way your height can increase.
in your opinion, guy what height then considered short alr?
Thank you Aunt Dino
Your online persona really cmi wor
As long as your girl is shorter than you, its fine.
Some girls don't even mind being taller than their men eg Nicole Kidman.
But that's rare.
7 is alright ah.
Its whats inside you that is more important.
Deaths from break though infections the highest
the best is probably mix but there is risks too.
LJ + LJ = SMLJ.
CB + CB = SMCB.
LJ + CB = LJCB.
CB + LJ = CBLJ  
i call rubbish.
Since they ventured to mix shots speak volumes of its efficacy.
Should let us do reverse.
One Pfizer dose then 2 Sinovac.
i am still holding out vaccination.
too many stories from both sides
0 x 0 x 0 = Infinity.
You're hired to be Thanos' intern.
China technology still the best.
i no longer trust all these alr
So after the 3rd jab, what's next?
chiu bo read cina or england properly, reduction % and effectiveness % meant differently
why cant they state every line in similar terms.
one vaccine says effectiveness and for another brand use reduction.
they just like to add a bit of confusion to the public
Fug this shiit, they all out to confuse you
Not so sure about how MOH measured.
But hor, there are a few test groups in that NIH study, the PPM and MMM ones, only 2 groups(1 PPM and 1 MMM) uses 50mcg moderna boosters.
Did they check whether they get the correct data?
All other uses 100mcg ones.
Wonder about sinkieland stats.
Then the same NIH study actually also hab test groups on MMP ones.
Wonder if enough data to make a statement yet.
please define the meaning of ‘effective’
SJWs want to control what you can say, who you rent your house to, and even who you date.
For a group that keeps calling their opponents Nazis, they sure act like one.
when it's gay and pink dot, it's "RACISM" to say "i prefer chinese men" .
When it's chinese girls, it's "okay" to say "i prefer white men" because "it's just a preference" .
that's why i have no qualms about this world going to ****ing ****.
i hope PAP gets 99% votes and a ****ing strong mandate and biden forces everyone to wear 10 masks and take 10 vaccines for every illness every other day and eveyone has a tracetogether token inserted in their necks to track their every movements
So you admit it is from your heart
soon one day they ownself create their own party liao.
these libtards are telling ppl you cannot have preferences or else you are discriminating.
curious if that gay an neh considered dating his own race though or did he specifically target chinese/malay men?
if so, isn't he discriminating his own kind?
The world is changing rapidly.
It always starts frm the US and slowly spreads thru the world.
Im nt surprise if such videos/topics are created nt by the person himself and rather by syndicates of such agenda.
Ignorant youngsters are the easiest targets to be influence by such.
Therefore, parents play a crucial role in educating them.
Truths tends to b manipulated if too many ppl at the same time twist and turn giving it another name.
95% of racisms are actually just preference being manipulated by bad ppl to fit their evil agenda .
using Western narrative for the 160th agenda.
when it comes to racism, it's really not an apple to apple comparison between west and east.
you want doesnt mean other ppl want.
then when ppl dont want, cry.
Isn't it know that the gay community is extremely racist?
More racist than the heterosexual community
What's wrong with having a preference?
if it disadvantage them, its call racism.
but when they have sexual fetishism for other race, they say preference.
Then SPG who pick only AMDK is racist too?
Chao gheys jskm!
spgs are not racist.
they, like the useless PAP scum, open legs to everyone but locals.
Article poorly written.
dont know what they pointing out.
When comes to relationship is all preference.
Just some dejected people trying to stir racisim.
If some one don't like durian you cannot force feed them right?
Or force someone watch football or horror.
Or in this case is heto rejecting you consider homophobic?
Preference la dood
next time even if ure not gay u cannot reject them i think
Yeah and the same person probably rejects a fat gay bbfa.
Probably citing preference of course.
So ghey don't eat brack dick is lacsim

Propaganda running and churning out very forcefully

People die every day, what's new?
Twitter is blocked in China.
They are not even trying now.
The report is in english, we can't trust reports written in english.
CGTN didn't report this news so it's probably fake.
