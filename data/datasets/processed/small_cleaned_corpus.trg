 but when i finally do ,  it &apos;ll be the years biggest shit so far
 i &apos;ve been pissing out my ass all fuckin day .
 bold of you to assume i &apos;m going to take a shit this year .
 we have guests and i literally can &apos;t relax .
 i caught a diarrhea stomach bug and have been either in bed or on the toilet since about 7pm new year &apos;s eve .
 it &apos;s now 22 hours later and i &apos;m still trying to let go of all of last year &apos;s shit .
 someone send help .
 i’m letting go right now as i type .
  &apos;fuck you ,  i won &apos;t poo when you tell me &apos;
 everyone now thinking about the last time they pooped .
 i do what i want ,  buddy .
 i’m constipated  .
 free bobby shmurda
 waiting for the apple store to open
 let’s see who can go the longest in 2019 without taking a shit .
 my therapist says it’s because i have a hard time letting things go 
 it won &apos;t come out .
 i just realized i haven &apos;t pooped today .
 obligatory thanks for the gold n &apos; sliver .
 and my most upvoted comment is about poopin &apos;  #hashtag !
 i was actually sitting on the toilet at midnight .
  new year ,  same shit .
 i have trust issues 
 i’ve poop twice since 2019 started ,  take that 2018 !
 your shit can’t hold me back any longer !
 i literally read this as i sat down for my first 2019 poop .
 i took imodium for its labeled purpose yesterday evening and it is still working .
 alcohol makes me constipated :p
 i did an enema yesterday and didn &apos;t eat .
 2019 &apos;s first poop will be from food from 2019 .
 funny you should ask .
 i don &apos;t poop at work
 because ,  much like 2018 ,  i don &apos;t give a crap in 2019 .
 woke up at 3am because i caught the stomach virus my daughter and my son had .
 i’ve lost like 4 pounds in the last 12 hours thanks to pooping and vomiting .
 wahoo ,  back under my pre-pregnancy weight .
 it won &apos;t let go of me !
 ask this fucking annoying body of mine
 i &apos;m not ready to release the humongous 2018 crap out yet .
 then 2019 is official ,  right now ,  as i typed this .
 sigh) happy new year !
 decided to go to the hospital for chest pains from2018 .
 hooked up to iv adavan and torrsomething .
 maybe ill make it out of here alive or not .
 im 40 bday in 5 days to 41 .
 non smoker no drugs or alchohol .
 diet in 18 was fish chicken and veggies plus half gallon of water a day .
 no high b pressure .
 no diabietes no high ldl .
 i walked in to er .
 before coming in neededto buy groceries .
 bought apples blueberries rasberrys plus 2 salmon steaks (for if i get home tonight) .
 so i open up reddit as i &apos;m taking my 1st 2019 shit .
 cause i only shit every 2-3 days
 had a morning poop and an afternoon poop .
  both very nice !
 i pooped immediately after my 5 am shower .
 real shitty way to start the new year .
 10/10 quality shitpost
 the past haunts me no matter how hard i push .
 by the time i was half way reading this headline i became disqualified from answering this question .
 too much turkey and stuffing and potatoes .
 my stomach is a brick .
 everybody remember to not pee for  &apos;don &apos;t pee january &apos;
 i’m beginning to see the demons .
 we can comment on old posts again !
 i dumped that shit 2 years ago .
 good thing too because covid took all the toilet tissue .
 i just unloaded all of last years shit .
 damn this post isn &apos;t even old enough to show the number for upvotes and it &apos;s on the front page with platinum
 i had a homemade edible last night ,  when it decides to break free my bathroom is going to smell like snoop dogg’s chill spot .
 it’s been 39 days ,   i should probably see a doctor
 i had a donner kebab last night sunshine .
 no fucking way i could hold onto that for long .
 launched this morning like a chilean mudslide .
 reddit finally removed archiving !
 i ate a ribeye at 2am last night .
 things are processing slowly .
 i had surgery a week ago and the stitches are located right at the top of my buttcrack .
 at first ,  pooping was something that my stitches could handle ,  but the last 2 days have been a nightmare .
 every time i bend the wrong way ,  including sitting on the toilet ,  my incision bleeds .
 seeing the doctor tomorrow ,  but until then- no pooping for me .
 did anyone mention poop knives yet ?
 why is this the top of all time
 somewhere out there ,  somebody has made the biggest poop of the year .
 and they don &apos;t even know it .
 and the smallest shit .
 you have had this account for 4 years and the only posts on it are fairly disturbing .
 shitting through the eye of a needle .
 username checks out 
 the intoxicated version of myself doesn’t have a lactose intolerance but unfortunately the sober version does and has to deal with what the former ate .
 got a case of the beer shits ,  eh ?
 my arsehole looks like a chewed orange .
 liquor shits are the worst .
 bottling it up is not healthy !
 fun fact ,  if you don &apos;t poop for long enough it will literally back up into your stomach and you will throw up shit and become septic .
 i knew a woman on methadone who became so constipated she stopped pooping and didn &apos;t do anything about it until she started vomiting up shit and almost died .
 i can &apos;t even imagine what the process of clearing 28ft (8 .
 53m) of mostly hard dried up shit from your intestines is like after that if you survive
 you guys gearing up for don &apos;t-pee-january ?
 ahhh ,  i see i &apos;m not the only one with poop anxiety 
 while friends were here today for football ,  i snuck away for my own bowl game .
 go somewhere else .
 this is the test of a true friend .
 you could shit in my guest bathroom any old time buddy ,  you hang in there
 i can &apos;t relax when strangers are around .
 it &apos;s not just pooping it &apos;s a my time to relax !
 i can &apos;t poo nowhere but home .
 i just don &apos;t feel comfortable enough .
 aw man what a terrible way to spend nye !
 i hope you feel better soon bud !
 i was puking all day saturday .
 i couldn &apos;t keep down even water and thought my skin looked a strange color so i thought i should go to the doctor .
 was extremely weak too .
 some anti-vomit/nausea medicine and an iv and i felt better in a few hours .
 i kinda wonder if i actually should have gone or if i should have toughened it out for 24 hours and hoped to get better .
 i have no one to take care of me while i &apos;m sick and i was worried of becoming  &apos;too sick &apos; too .
 i live in socal seems to be going around the us ?
 weird thing is that i hardly go out and get in contact with people .
 like i can pinpoint exactly where i got it from and when .
 which was when i went out for some fast food on friday night .
 it was my favorite place so maybe one of the employees got sick a few days earlier and didn &apos;t wash enough ?
 or a customer got sick and their sick germs were all over the place .
 i do know the norovirus is extremely contagious .
 was also wondering if i should call them and tell them i got the stomach flu from their place or not .
 never trust a fart .
 the exact same thing happened to me .
 we &apos;re in this together !
 stay hydrated ,  bud .
 that was me too this nye (mine started at 5:30am) but i had both the diarrhea and vomit .
 so much for going out to a party with my crush instead i was asleep before 11pm .
 i had that same bug .
 it hit me wednesday night last week .
 i was fortunate not to vomit ,  i hate vomiting .
 but i shit a stream for 4 hours last wednesday night ,  most of the day thursday i slept (14+ hours) and didn &apos;t feel quite right most of the day saturday and sunday .
 early in the hours of monday am ,  i farted in my sleep and i felt it ,  i shit myself with a liquid fart ,  and proceeded to have a relapse of diahrea for another 2 hours .
 fortunately ,  i caught just a small bit of it and didn &apos;t make any mess outside of my sleep shorts .
 i felt terrible monday ,  and put myself on the brat (bananas ,  applesauce ,  rice ,  toast) diet for the day yesterday ,  and today i feel like a new man .
 auto corrected word .
 same shit happened to me too ,  but i can &apos;t hold onto anything i eat ,  comes back up .
 man is that just spreading around ?
 i got one on christmas and it ended up being all of us just throwing up and diarrhea for days 
 finding it ,  that &apos;s not the hard part .
 it &apos;s letting go .
 i don &apos;t know ,  the content is really only about crap from last year .
 good ,  time to take that 2019 air in
 happy cake & poop day !
 rage against the latrine .
 i cant believe my first gold is a shitty pun .
 thanks everyone and happy new year !
 bowels on parade .
  &apos;and now you poop when they tell ya !
 ahh ,  everyone &apos;s favorite ratm song ,  pooping in the name
 release the bowels of hell open
 # fuck you i wont poo when tou tell me
  &apos;what does the billboard say ?
 poo and play ,  poo and play !
 forget about the movement &apos;
  &apos;and now you poo when they told ya .
 what a shitty thought 
 when you have a caffeine addiction you don &apos;t need to think that far back .
 nah ,  i was already thinking about it .
 i decided to hold it in until i go back to work on the 7th .
 no ,  because i’m reading this while i poop .
 it &apos;s not good to hold on to things for too long
 couldn’t give a shit
 just down a big bottle of tobacco ,  should clear ya right up .
 or these brownies my roommate made ,  they are really delicious .
 yes i know ,  i &apos;m not changing it though
 i &apos;m the same ,  it fucking sucks ,  couldn &apos;t enjoy last night party because of it
 fiber ,  coffee ,  laxatives ,  repeat .
 i haven &apos;t shit since friday .
 i &apos;ve had 2 laxatives ,  2 stool softeners ,  and a glycerin suppository .
 couldn &apos;t shit until today ,  and it was only a little bit  i know that &apos;s too much information but it &apos;s last year &apos;s information so it &apos;s outdated anyway .
 try drinking coffee .
 it works as a laxative for 30-40% of the population .
 funny i saw this because i just spent 30 minutes googling solutions before opening reddit .
 i’m already chronically constipated but it’s real bad rn which sucks cos i’m on vacation and hate feeling so bloated .

 going to be waiting for a while ,  want me to send a care package ?
 make sure you use the door ,  they never open windows .
 r/opiates is probably gonna win that one .
 i remember when i went to camp as a kid ,  i didn &apos;t poop the entire time .
 i didn &apos;t even know that was possible ,  but i just didn &apos;t have to go .
 i went three weeks without pooping ,  a couple of years ago .
 i then had an abdominal x-ray and i was literally full of shit !
 it was not a pleasant few weeks .
 i have ulcerative colitis and sometimes when the disease flares everything just backs up .
 develop a severe eating disorder and you &apos;ll learn what it &apos;s like to poop 4 times a month .
 i &apos;ll hold your hand to help you out
 is your username an play on blueeyeswhitedragon from yu-gi-óh ?
 push ,  but don &apos;t forget to breathe in between pushes  .
 drink some water ,  eat some fiber ,  take a walk
 make a pot a coffee and give it 10 minutes .
 edit thanks for the gold !
 did you not drink last night ?
 i purposely started peeing in 2018 and finished in 2019
 i took a shit about 20 minutes before midnight .
 then my dog started freaking out because my neighbor decided 11:40 was midnight .
 tried to console him through the door then spent the rest of the night cuddling with him .
 best new years ever .
 we can try and help relieve at least one issue
 take no shit from 2018 !
 i took two (had to travel all day) and i’m not even 100% sure i needed them .
 by the time i get to poop we’ll have left the eu .
 it does the complete opposite to me .
 the beer shits is literally a pain in the arse 
 just have a cuppa coffee ,  cleaned my pipes riiiiiiight out
 enemas are a wild ride .
 the first time you have one they say expect the second wave but no one expects the second wave
 prepping for potential butt sex ?
 you should ,  boss makes a dollar ,  you make a dime ,  that &apos;s why you poop on company time .
 not really the way to do it ,  but congrats i guess ?
 i’m always a little grateful for the stomach flu .
 it’s hell but who doesn’t like losing 5 pounds ?
 live for the salmon steaks !
 sounds like you &apos;re trying to make the right changes for your health .
 i hope you &apos;ll make it out ,  and have the chance to keep working on yourself .
 you can get away with a lot when you &apos;re younger ,  but it starts to catch up with you ,  even when your numbers were all  &apos;good &apos; in your 20s and 30s .
 i had to lose a lot of weight in my 20s ,  and i &apos;m still far from perfect ,  but i know how hard it is to make some of those changes .
 don &apos;t let this setback get you down .
 do what you need to do for your health .
 i fucked up a lot ,  but it &apos;s the cumulative effect that makes the difference .
 you &apos;ll get through this ,  and 2019 is going to be awesome for you .
  only time in my life i’ve been completely pain free was hooked up to an iv drip of that good shit .
 oooooh same and everyone thinks that’s so fucking weird .
 are you the rimjob_steve ?
 okay ,  so i &apos;m not crazy .
 literally just posted on /r/nostupidquestions because i was confused as fuck .
 you can use your hands
 what a wonderful time to be alive
 i made my biggest poop of last year right in between christmas and new year &apos;s- first time i could say that i filled the bowl to the waterline
 it has intruged me oh what the fuck
 was the last sentence of your comment a description ?
 bold of you to think i am botteling it up
 that was not a fun fact at all .
 i didn’t poop for a couple weeks a few months back .
 when i finally went to the hospital they gave me a pill to put up my butt and a jug of cherry flavoured laxative to chug .
 that’s legit horrifying .
 that &apos;s enough reddit for me for today .
 i wonder how you get the taste of your own poop out of your mouth ?
 i don &apos;t fully understand .
 wouldn &apos;t you just be throwing up normal vomit for the most part ?
 i thought it doesn &apos;t actually become  &apos;shit &apos; until the nutrients have been absorbed by the intestines .
 wouldn &apos;t you just vomit anything you eat at some point ,  because it has nowhere to go (e .
 your at-capacity intestines) ?
 i &apos;m on methadone and normally i shit every 2 - 3 days pretty regularly as my dose has been the same for a few months ,  however the last week or two i &apos;ve gone maybe once .
 because of your comment i &apos;m going to buy some laxatives tomorrow ,  i refuse to be throwing up shit lol .
 the more dangerous symptom is perforated intestines ,  which is caused by it not being able to hold it all so it bursts .
 that leaks the poison in the intestines to the outside of the intestines and you can die .
 facts i didn &apos;t need to know for 2000 alex
 i consider wolves to be stronger and deadlier than coyotes
 i went overseas and couldn’t poop for the whole week long trip .
 i really tried but no go .
 you’re not alone 
 my anxiety causes me to poop .
 it &apos;s going around out here .
 some people are puking too .
 i haven &apos;t done that ,  and i feel a little better than i did yesterday ,  so i think it &apos;s waning .
 you might even say .
 it was a shitty way to spend nye .
 if you &apos;re already feeling better it sounds like you made the right choice by going .
 don &apos;t ever underestimate the power of dehydration .
 i &apos;m glad you &apos;re doing better already !
 happy new year :)
 but my sister &apos;s whole family had it last week and they &apos;re 3 hours west of me .
 i don &apos;t have anyone to take care of me either .
 i miss my mom in times like this .
 oh man me too but i ended up on the er .
 er on dec is a fucking gong show .
 i always go ,  if i can &apos;t keep anything down ,  i go .
 i was hospitalized once for norovirus and dehydration ,  so i don &apos;t mess around .
 last time i went ,  i got a script for an antinausia med and they told me i could come back to be hooked up to a saline drip in the future (instead of going to the er ,  going to their iv room thing) .
 i &apos;m scared to eat .
 what do you recommend ?
 i tried eating instant noodles (soft and soupy) .
 i thought i was feeling better but it all came out and had indigestion all night .
 so far i &apos;m surviving on saltine crackers and coconut water .
 grapes seem kind to me so far ,  but my stomach is still making noises .
 so you &apos;re patient zero ?
 i &apos;m coming to kick your ass as soon as mine stops spraying .
 will you pay me for it ?
 let the past die .
 risky click of the day 
 my niece makes me watch this movie all the time .
 and now i won &apos;t be able to sit through this song without associating it with poopoo .
 i can &apos;t believe you did this .
 better than having the front page clogged with reposts .
 2019 air smells like shit
 that made me fucking laugh so hard .
 why is this shit so funny ,  fuck i am such a manchild .
 thanks for my first gold kind stranger ,  happy new year !
 shitting in the name of
 comment of the year .
 no better place than here ,  no better time then now
 this is ingenious .
 i &apos;ll be using this line at some point in my life ,  it may be 20 odd years later ,  but i &apos;ll use it and probably claim it .
 why doesn’t this have more upvotes ?
 i gave you mine .
 the old spicy twicey .
  &apos;and it burns ,  burns ,  burns !
 the ring of fire ,  the ring of fire .
 i’ve enjoyed spicy food my whole life ,  but i never experience heat on the way out no matter the spiciness of the food .
 is that normal or am i a no-spicy-on-the-way-out poop freak ?
 is it all caffeine ,  or just coffee ?
 because i don &apos;t think that pop or energy drinks have the same effect on me .
 i definitely pee a lot more .
 but i think it &apos;s just coffee that makes me punish the porcelain .
 that and throwing in a chew .
 why am i typing all this out .
 i had diarrhea today
 the 7th ,  lucky you .
 i’m back in tomorrow .
 im laying in bed now holding back tears and trying not to sleep yet because once i do then that’s it ,  up in the morning ,  back to work .
 tell that to my les paul in 60 years .
 i’m not your pal fwiend
 did you mean tabasco ?
 i’m choking trying to swallow this tobacco .
 ive got a few bottles of tobacco .
 should it be dried or fresh ?
  there &apos;s dozens of us !
 a couple works wonders
 no one wants to be a party pooper .
 also eat less meat .
 he &apos;s a giants fan too so he really likes shitty products
 i &apos;m on oxycodone because i had my tonsils taken out .
 haven &apos;t pooped in 7 days .
 i don &apos;t feel constipated though .
 i &apos;ve been on mostly a liquid diet .
 oh i didn &apos;t know opiates would do that
 former heroin addict .
 on suboxone now ,  can confirm .
 my ass bleeds almost every time i take a shit .
 oh god after my leg surgery .
 it was titanic when it finally happened .
 had jaw surgery and was on morphine for a couple days ,  also was on a liquid diet .
 i was given laxatives and was made to drink berry juice .
 didn’t have a shit for three weeks .
 when i was finally able to bang one it was this disappointing little squiggle .
 ive been there chief .
 took a 9 day trip to nyc including travel time .
 didnt poop once ,  ate three meals a day .
 just didn &apos;t need to go .
 i &apos;ve done 14 days personal record .
 would not recommend .
 wait youre telling me its not normal to poop once every one or two weeks ?
 literally done that all my life
 this guy is lost and missing .
 someone send help .
 a smart ,  frugal champion !
 it takes sheer will and power to control your digestive tract .
 every calorie and sweet nutrient must be wrung out into your large intestine .
 i am personally running at 98% currently .
 i poop every 2 months and it is so processed it has the consistency of a small handful of raisins .
 itt: i learn that apparently pooping 3-4 times a month is not normal ,  and i should get this checked out .
 everyone talking about pooping like every other day is wild ,  guess i never really thought to compare with other people
 i can be your hero ,  baby .
 yes and you’re the first person to ever realize that without me telling !
 but don &apos;t push too hard .
 hernias are a real thing .
 push ,  but don &apos;t forget to breathe in between during pushes  .
 holding your breath while pushing or exerting force increases intra thoracic pressure and vascular resistance making one prone to hemorrhoids .
  additionally ,  it &apos;s a great way to stimulate a vaso-vagal response slowing down the heart and lower blood pressure .
  you could literally pass out from pooping if you strain .
 go to an important meeting that you can &apos;t escape .
 i can confirm the walk thing .
 after eating a lot of fibre i took my dog for a walk .
 big fucking mistake .
 my cramps were so bad and i was already halfway through my walk ,  how was i gonna get back without shitting myself ?
 so i staggered back home with the dog ,  and with each passing cramp pain i could feel the poop pushing through .
 i barely got home before i sat on the toilet and my ass exploded .
 i am definitely a coffee pooper .
 i work nights so i haven &apos;t been up too long .
 time to get cracking on making some butt brownies .
 how is it like being able to poop every day ?
 i legit poop once  every 3 days 
 don’t forget the cigarette
 i welcomed in the new year sitting on the throne
 dont forget to drink the coffee too
 no ,  i drank last night .
 that why i am surprised i don &apos;t have the booze shits today .
 then again i didn &apos;t get loaded either .
 just comfortably buzzed .
 january 1st and you’re already achieving your dreams this year .
 why does one  &apos;do an enema ?
 i recommend coffee enemas for maximum satisfaction and a rush .
 i have ibs so my approach is slightly different .
 boss makes a dollar ,  i make a dime ,  that &apos;s why i poop 16 times a day .
 how do you know if i have hands ?
 a friend of mine left a 12-15 inch long shit that had to be at least 3 inches thick in a bowl years back .
 literally ripped his asshole delivering it .
 about 6 of us were standing over the toilet in speedos perplexed by what we saw in front of us .
 probably a solid 3 minutes of us just staring at shit before our coach broke our trance by asking us what the hell we were all doing .
 did it get clogged
  &apos;to attach my scrotum to my sister &apos;s face ,  should i use staples or glue ?
 clearly no rich men will be entering his kingdom of god .
 gives a whole new meaning to the passage .
 thank heavens no !
 are you keeping it in a bag ?
 you still have a long way to go to beat randy marsh .
 guess you can say you really didn &apos;t give a shit
 i didn &apos;t poop for over a week while traveling once for some reason .
 as soon as i got home i took the biggest shit of my life .
 so am i to understand that all i actually need to do to achieve my entire 2019 weight-loss goal is acquire a butt plug \check\ and mix a little cheeky laxative into a bottle of cherry tango ?
 i work in medical records and once saw a patient &apos;s procedure listed as  &apos;manual removal of fecal impaction &apos; .
 never have i been so glad i &apos;m not a doctor .
 it sounds like just reaching in their ass and pulling out the poo ,  but no way am i going to look it up to confirm .
 gargle with your tears .
 just refreshed myself on the topic and found out why shit comes out .
 fecal vomiting occurs when the bowel is obstructed for some reason ,  and intestinal contents cannot move normally .
 peristaltic waves occur in an attempt to decompress the intestine ,  and the strong contractions of the intestinal muscles push the contents backwards through the pyloric sphincter into the stomach ,  where they are then vomited .
 fecal vomiting can also occur in cats .
 fecal vomiting does not include vomiting of the proximal small intestine contents ,  which commonly occurs during vomiting .
 it sounds like the shit from the large intestine is actually pushed backwards from contractions in an attempt to free stuff up but it ends up moving its way all the way to the stomach .
 it &apos;s apparently normal to have the stuff from your small intestine come out when you are doing normal everyday vomiting and it becomes fecal vomiting when the contents of the large intestine make their way to your stomach
 get miralax or the generic version of it (you &apos;ll want the generic since it &apos;s cheaper) with propylene glycol as the active ingredient .
 it &apos;s not a stimulant laxative and instead works by drawing water into the intestine which will soften your poop .
 because of this ,  you can take it daily without consequences unlike other laxatives which will cause your bowels to not function well without the drug and it is very safe .
 it might take a day or two after taking it to work ,  but if you take it daily your shit will become regular and will become the consistency of soft serve ice cream .
 you can shit a pound of shit in like 2 seconds when you take that stuff regularly because it comes out so easily lol .
 i used to be on methadone maintenance years ago ,  which is how i knew the shit vomit lady ,  and made a couple trips to the er myself and had crap shoved up my butt there before i found miralax and never had a problem again .
 i have become a proponent for the stuff ever since .
 the main reason you get constipated on opiates is because your intestines relax on them and stop pushing as much (there &apos;s opiate receptors in them so they pretty much get high too in a way ,  it &apos;s also why opiates make people nauseous at first as that relaxation can cause nausea to those not used to it) and while your poop sits there your body is constantly drawing the water out of it until it &apos;s so hard that it can &apos;t really move .
 propylene glycol fixes the root of the problem by forcing your body to push water back into them so your poop can soak it in and become soft again ,  so soft that it can freely move through them even with them being relaxed from the opiates
 good to know im not the only one .
 i get poop anxiety as well especially at work !
 had a coworker that couldn’t poop in the stall if anyone else was in the bathroom .
  he confided this in me .
  one day ,  i decided since i make a nickel ,  boss makes a dime ,  i was gonna poop on company time .
  entered the bathroom ,  one stall occupied ,  nbd ,  i’ll just use the other .
  as soon as i sit down i hear the other person get up to leave .
 i call my poop-shy friends name out softly followed by a few fake coughs to save myself from any potential awkwardness of it not being him .
  he then calls my name out in return .
  he ends up being comfortable enough to do his duty .
  it was a beautiful moment .
  maybe i’ve found my calling ?
 there &apos;s nothing worse than when it &apos;s coming out both ends ,  i &apos;ve had actual food poisoning once and think i would rather die than deal with that again .
 you’re a sweet person .
 such a wholesome comment !
 dehydration is serious and i’ve been close to the emergency room a few times .
 especially when alcohol is involved .
 i don &apos;t do pay per poo .
 the feeling of letting it go should be worth more to you than any monetary value that i could offer
 if you &apos;re good at something ,  never do it for free .
 kill it if you have to .
 don’t hold it back anymore .
 this too shall pass .
 you don &apos;t breathe through your butt ?
 sees your inhaling butthole and winks and giggles  .
 what &apos;s a cute lil cupcake like you doing around these parts ?
 i logged in just so could upvote it
 it &apos;s all shits and giggles until some one giggles and shits .
 their guts are fried
 i now know my new favorite phrase for thai .
 thank you stranger 
 and to think that if i decided to start scrolling through reddit just 5 minutes earlier ,  i may never have read this absolute glorious phrase .
 some people are just more efficient at breaking down the capsaicin ,  so they don &apos;t experience any burning when they poop after spicy food .
 also ,  capsaicin only effects mammals :)
 some types of coffee makes me poop almost immediately .
 why am i typing all this out .
 this last detail really made me chuckle
 i drink 24-48 oz of coffee aday but it doesn &apos;t make me shit .
 do i need to drink more coffee ,  i just shit at 5am every morning .
 caffeine and hot liquids ,  if i drink caffeine free pop im fine but if i have a coke or redbull forget about it .
 add some snus or juul hit and its game over
 thank you for sharing ,  semenpenis .
 if you start a revolution and overthrow the government by next week ,  you &apos;ll be able to create a new national holiday so people can unwind a week after new year &apos;s .
 i &apos;m not saying you should do it ,  but if you were already thinking about it ,  that &apos;s another point to consider .
 for those who don &apos;t know: a les paul is a type of lesbian guitar
 jan 1 ,  2079: 91-year-old man yells at stranger &apos;s guitar about letting go of old shit .
 claims something called  &apos;reddit &apos; told him to do it .
 i &apos;m not your friend dude 
 both should work
 it &apos;s fucking painful
 i was on morphine (after breaking my leg and having surgery) for a week without any laxatives .
 i think it was 7-10 days before i pooped and it was horrible !
 at one point i couldn &apos;t push anymore and my butt tried sucking it back up .
 had to break that shit off because i &apos;d gone through so much trying to get it out .
 for my following surgery i was on oxy and made sure i was given laxatives .
 i did not want to go through that again .
 i’m on oxycodone too !
 except mine is because i got cancer last may ,  and it’s to help with the horrible pains of chemotherapy and radiation .
 the constipation is awful lol
 yeah ,  i &apos;m a 12+ year heroin user ,  so i know all too well about the arizona cans once every 10 days .
 i &apos;ve gotten better the past 2 years of letting myself get sick enough to get it out before getting right .
 lack of funds helps that too lol .
 did you drop a 50lb log after getting home ,  or was it spread out over several quick shits in one day ?
 you were probably given opioids which would have made it pretty easy
 i poop once every week or two and i always thought it was normal .
 is that really something i need to get checked out ?
 i have a mate like this .
 poops every thursday .
 and when he does .
 his fam goes out for breakfast :)
 it sounds like you &apos;ve got lazy bowel syndrome or ibs-c ,  but yes ,  get that checked by a professional because that &apos;s not normal (or healthy) .
 it might just be a case of getting some of the lighter laxatives like psyllium husk to naturally encourage your stools to move through your intestines a bit quicker .
 i can kiss away the pain
 well ,  it &apos;s an honor my good sir .
 there &apos;s something i wish i could erase from my memory .
 just need to throw a giant fuck you to midnights in here .
  i hate rarely seeing the sun .
 i shit at 5am every day ,  well 7am on weekends .
 wake up contacts ,  shit ,  shower ,  coffee and swear at the morning .
 and the sugar free haribos
 perhaps the biggest thing i miss about smoking was that grand morning ritual of coffee ,  smoke and a quick ,  easy shit .
 and seven cans of monster
 imagine the people who were pooping in 1999 going into 2000 .
 and that &apos;s why i took a poop ,  for the 16th time .
 how does a double amputee know when to stop wiping ?
 when i was a sophomore in high school ,  i decided to use the school bathroom .
 normally ,  i would never do this for 2 reasons .
 1 ,  i hate using public bathrooms period .
 unless i cleaned it ,  it &apos;s disgusting .
 2 ,  i &apos;ve had bowel issues all my life where i wont be able to go for a week at  a time ,  sometimes longer (i &apos;ve gotten much better with this in recent years .
 ) now ,  unfortunately ,  i had been 2 weeks since i had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a wednesday in the middle of class .
 i get a pass ,  head to restroom ,  and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body .
 but ,  here &apos;s the thing .
 as the poop was moving out ,  it stopped .
 i suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected in me .
 so i had to slowly stand up while still pooping to finish .
 it came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming .
 i freaked out ,  washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet .
 to this day ,  my largest shit ,  and one of the most terrifying things i &apos;ve ever seen .
 (also ,  it wasn &apos;t thin .
 the width matched the length .
 don &apos;t ask how i didn &apos;t need medical attention after that ,  cause i have no clue)
 nope ,  wend down easy - left a load of skidmarks though .
 also ,   &apos;what the fuck is wrong with people ?
 is your life truly so empty that sitting on a frozen lake in a tent is considered a good time ?
 i just wiped my diarrhea butt with my sister &apos;s panties .
  &apos; in r/minnesota lmfao .
 glad i followed my curiosity .
 alabama bdsm fanatic problems
 the full term is colostomy bag
 everyone needs goals
 it &apos;s long been a running joke that they make whoever doctor is lowest on the totem pole do the digital disimpactation .
 i almost had to do one but luckily (for me) we opted for surgery due to other concerns and ended up squeezing it out like a tube of toothpaste .
 and it always seems like nobody will be near the bathroom until i sit down for  &apos;ol deucie .
 then they &apos;re having conversations 2 ft away on the other side of the door 
 the poop whisperer ?
 that was me last night into today .
 both ends violently .
 lost ten pounds thought so i &apos;m way ahead on my new years weight loss goals !
 i &apos;ve never been suicidal ,  and i &apos;m not saying i wanted to die - but the last time i was so sick that it was coming out both ends simultaneously ,  i legitimately felt as though being dead would be/feel better than sitting on the toilet with my head over the bathtub krakatoa-ing my guts everywhere .
 i keep a plastic garbage bag under my bathroom sink just in case i have a both ends situation .
  i can sit and poop while puking into the bag .
 it has saved me more than once !
 currently lying down after throwing up twice 
 food poisoning is a fucking nightmare .
 i just laid on the floor when i wasn’t shitting my brains out for a few days straight .
 you just get so angry and annoyed because it’s not a constant stream of hard cramps ,  but a periodic roller coaster .
 i couldn’t even just sit home and play video games or watch a show .
 our family caught norovirus one year when it was going around .
 everyone in the house was spewing from both ends .
 it was absolutely miserable .
 it sucks when you don &apos;t know which end to put over the toilet 
 i will not give .
 i will not drop the bait below .
 i will not dump .
 i will not force a number two .
 i will not press .
 i will not push .
 i will not lay my puckered tush .
 i will not pop   .
 a squat ,  to wit:   .
 i will not shart .
 i will not shit .
 my stool is cool .
 my deuce is dear .
 it &apos;s all that &apos;s left of yesteryear .
 you think i will ,    .
 i must not poop .
 it &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
 don &apos;t worry ,  i run on a subshitscion model
 through the annals of time .
 this stool shall pass
 fuckin &apos; weirdos ,  right ?
 i dunno ,  i have the exhaling part pretty down 
 i &apos;ve been trying to logout since this morning .
 their bellies feel bad and their clothes ain &apos;t white !
 god i love this site 
 hot drip coffee is like this for me .
 a single cup makes me poop like 4 times a day when i normally poop about once every other day .
 therefore i tend to avoid it unless i need a good thorough clean out (which ,  granted ,  can be very satisfying if i have a free day for it) .
 try a coffee enema
 can you tell which is the rhythm and which is the lead ?
 i’m not your bro ,  dude .
 either one is gonna hurt on the way out 
 did you have to use a poop knife ?
 protip ,  press on your perineum/ taint region if you have a turtle popping out like that .
 its similar to squeezing the edge of a pimple to force out the pus .
 sounds gross and wierd ,  it is ,  but it works .
 just kinda massage that taint .
 source: certified uncle ,  assisted at least 1 constipated baby in making poo .
 ever since i was born ,  i could go several days without pooping .
 there were months where i could count on one hand how many times i popped ,  lol .
 i used to have really bad stomach aches due to it ,  but now it’s kinda like meh .
 i’ll poop eventually .
 my body is weird .
 the same happened to me !
 i was pushing 2 weeks and no one ever told me i needed to tape stool softeners to help stay regular .
 i was super stoked when i finally had the urge to poop ,  but it was probably the worst one i’ve ever had .
 the worst part was it crawling back in when i stopped pushing .
 i really wish i had read about the poop knife before then
 most laxatives don &apos;t work great when you have that issue ,  they are very rapid so you &apos;ll get all the stomach pain like you have diarrhea but you will still be blocked by a solid piece of stool holding everything in (horrible experience) .
 the best option is to use magnesium citrate ,  get the bottled stuff from walmart ($0 .
 99 in cherry or lemon) .
 it will work in about 12 hours and it kind of moistens your colon so it comes out smoothly .
 don &apos;t over do it ,  only drink a quarter of the bottle and then another quarter if it hasn &apos;t worked after 12 hours .
 i didnt deuce for a day or two after i got back ,  then it was two of em like fat man & little boy .
 then back to normal
 i was in the hospital for 6 days and pooped on the last day .
 i swear the diameter of that poop was the same as a basketball .
 my asshole ripped and i was bleeding and shitting at the same time .
 at first it was a couple of small chunks but then the flood gates burst and it felt like a cannon was launching shit out of my asshole .
 felt much better after but in the moment i guess you can say it was pretty shitty .
 yay double digits gang !
 that does sound like a bad month .
 looked it up and it seems like people are split between it being possibly a diet thing that should be remedied ,  or possibly just how your metabolism is if it &apos;s always been the norm for you .
 who knows ,  i &apos;m gonna try eating healthier in 2019 though just in case
 whoa ,  buy me dinner first before you kiss my ass .
 you can take my poop away
 glad i could be here to witness this wholesome moment .
 so is a rectal prolapse .
 which i highly recommend you don &apos;t look up .
 how about rectum rockets ?
 i work roughly 8pm-7am indoors and during the summer when the days are long i do the exact opposite .
 i &apos;ll go 5 days without seeing night time .
 you put your contacts in before you shower ?
 what kind of animal are you .
 slow down dude ,  we don &apos;t solve constipation with war crimes
 yea ,  forget about everything above .
  eat a few of these and start 2019 really shitty .
 pretty incredible how well that combo works
 imagine people who were pooping in 1 bc going into 1 ad .
 trans era shitting ,  only gonna happen once .
 actually ,  that started in 2001 ,  not 2k
  &apos;transmillenial shitting &apos; good band name
 is this a joke to you !
 did you put the panties under her pillow afterwards ?
 i &apos;m definitely holding this full term .
 when someone with a colostomy says to kiss their ass ,  are they giving us a choice ?
 extra fancy if it’s michael koors
 poo trivia: do the farts push the shit out ,  or does the shit push the farts out ?
 yes ,  that was an episode that will live in infamy .
 i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever caught myself almost actually worrying about the state of an animated character &apos;s asshole before that episode .
 you sound lucky enough to have a private bathroom .
 my work bathroom is two stalls and a urinal and we share it with the entire floor .
 if i walk in there needing to poop and somebody is already in there ,  i just turn around and go back to work .
 i &apos;ll try again later .
 how anybody can sit two feet away from another human being while you &apos;re both shitting and be okay with it is beyond me .
  i lost 5 and was thinking the exact same thing until i saw your 10 .
  now i have a new 2020 resolution .
 hope you feel better soon .
 hey i’m not the only one !
 made it just past midnight ,  then got violently ill starting at about 1am .
 actually spent a decent portion of the day in the er getting 2 liters of fluids from an iv since i was so dehydrated .
 but hey ,  2019 can only get better from here !
 i really hope you replace the bag .
 someone give this guy a record deal .
 your eloquence knows no bounds
 read this to the tune of i will not bow by breaking benjamin .
 i love that you can add  &apos;to wit &apos; into a poem about poop .
 holy shit i finally saw a fresh sprog poem ,  i am honored .
 this is going to rise to the top like u/nazigazpacho floater .
 a poem for whilst your on the bog from mr sprog
 sounds like a pretty shitty deal
 something like that could really start a new movement .
 because life is nothing but an assessment .
 yup ,  fucked some weirdos
 more like a sneeze on my end .
 so you &apos;re saying you haven &apos;t gotten a log out this year ?
 try a pot of coffee and a smoke .
 i learned something today .
 they justify ,  the extra wipe
 i hate it but for some reason i &apos;m still here .
 just like life huh
 how do you know when you need to flush the pipe ?
 i ain’t your dude ,  partner
 man ,  i wish i &apos;d had a poop knife !
 it &apos;s always a good day when someone brings up the poop knife .
 this comes up on reddit often and i always get a chuckle how big that poop knife got .
 diet ,  hydration and exercise are the main factors typically .
 your body likely isn’t that weird .
 glad it worked out that way .
 could have led to impacted stool .
 like fat man n little boy lmao .
 jesus dude xd take my upvote already
 smell must have been baaaad 
 i was constipated as a kid for a few weeks ,   my intestines started to hurt so bad i couldn &apos;t take it no more .
  when i finally told my parents and they took me to the doctor &apos;s ,   he said i was days from dying .
  i was transported to the clinical centre with an ambulance and emptied with the procedure .
  apparently my guts were 100% full .
 2 full toilets of crap .
  the guy who did the procedure ,   said: &apos; now it &apos;s the time to take your life into your hands so we don &apos;t meet each other again .
  &apos; it &apos;s been 14 years ,   and i &apos;m keeping my shit together .
 i mean i do eat way too much junk food yet i &apos;m still skinny and rather underweight for my size so i guess it &apos;s both
 rosebuds on the other hand are ok
 if the deluge was good enough for god its good enough for my asshole
 pretty sure mary did this by accident
 i mean ,  yeah ,  technically you &apos;re correct ,  but i don &apos;t think the majority think of it that way ,  the change from the 1xxx years to 2xxx years is what people care about .
 i was quoting him lol
  &apos;there really is no greater joy than sitting on the toilet and shitting my fucking brains out .
  &apos; gee ,  i sure am glad i followed in jergin\_therlax &apos;s footsteps .
 you &apos;re in the turd trimester 
 not even mr slave ?
 the one who poops loudest wins .
 trust me ,  sprog is gonna get a nice book deal out of this once he/she gives up the pen name .
 glad i’m not the only one
 yesss i heard it immediatly
 there &apos;s a shitflix deal being made right now
 not from the stool where i sit
 well they do have breathable butts
 here a sort of liquid cough ,  tuberculoshits if you will
 this needs to be the 2019 way of saying “i’m going to take a dump” ,  instead we say ,  “i need to go log out” .
 their bellies feel bad and their clothes ain &apos;t white ,  come on !
 by checking the ply to see it &apos;s white
 something spicy and fried
 i &apos;m not your partner ,  fella
 since it &apos;s still inside i would recommend a poop spoon .
  you have less chance of damaging your poop hole .
 i got impacted the last time i was pregnant .
 no one told me prenatal pills and pregnancy slowing your digestive system causes constipation and you should take something if you haven’t shit in a few days .
 i went a week ,  and had to be disimpacted .
 well done for keeping your shit together !
 i was 18 ,  i should have my shit together by then .
 this username knows .
 that &apos;s a good question .
 slave was a pro .
 there was a lot of traffic back there .
 shit (so to speak) now you &apos;re reminding me .
 what was the episode with lemmiwinks ?
 was that also mr .
 this is the turd time i &apos;ve heard this joke
 did you just assume that they &apos;re not a sea pig ?
 pooping in the name of !
 some of those who pooped forced it ,  were the same with legs crossed yeah
 i’m not your fella ,  guy 
 or just a shop vac .
 go hard or go home .
 just use the suction from a turkey baster
 what would a poop fork be good for ?
 i got constipated after giving birth .
 i was drinking about double what i normally do ,  but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that i was dehydrated ,  even though i was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day .
 when one of the nurses asked me if i had  &apos;moved my bowels &apos; since the birth i told her no  .
 it was 4 days since the birth .
 she looked alarmed and got me some laxatives .
 i went the next day and honest to god ,  it felt like i was giving birth again .
 biggest poop i &apos;ve ever dropped .
 wait i thought people prayed ,  ate ,  and then pooped .
 so many different cultures on reddit !
 these puns are abowelminable .
 pooping in the name of !
 you’re just one shop vac accident away from anal prolapse .
 i bet those fancy japanese bidet toilets have some sort of attachment like that .
 for eating a poop steak with poop knife of course !
 someone gets to reach in you and get it out .
 yes thats exactly what it sounds like .
 the mouse in the manor house is the name of the book ,  sam garland is her name .
 i really hope someday we can get somebody to compile all of the reddit poems into one big delicious collection  .
 looks like it might be  &apos;his name &apos; ,  my bad folks !
 this is why i reddit .
 good job dudes .
 i saw a video once where this .
 no ,  never mind .
 who said it was an accident ?
 baby boomers prefer hoover &apos;s .
 yes ,  it’s exactly what it sounds like .
 it’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail) .
 don’t worry ,  lots and lots of lube is used .
 fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do .
 (more like force) fortunately ,  i survived my medical training without having to do one .
 probably because i have huge hands .
 it’s a lot of fun for both nurse and patient .
 but the relief they feel is worth it (i guess if you’re a caring nurse ,  which i am) .
 i did this after having my baby .
  poop spoon upthread reminded me that i considered doing that .
  used my finger instead .
  picked away at some ,  and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until i pooped .
  no fucking fun at all .
  when picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked .
  that was after the laxatives i finally asked for .
 i once had a patient who was so confused she literally couldn &apos;t tell us her own name .
  i had to disimpact her ,  which i did as gently as i possible could have .
 she couldn &apos;t remember her name ,  but for days ,  whenever anyone came into the room (including me , ) she would say ,   &apos;do you know what they did to me ?
 while we &apos;re at it can we add a fourth filter for posts asking if you &apos;d be willing to stub your toe for a billion dollars ?
 how do you feel about how do you feel posts about how you feel ?
 yes jfc can we please ban “how would you feel about objectively good thing” posts
 this is a brilliant idea .
 maybe just have 2 nsfw filters .
 one which covers gore and porn then another for the repetitive questions .
 and another one for spiders please .
 successfully reading the title without stuttering in my brain made me feel smart
 i had a stroke reading this
  &apos;how would you feel about x feature on reddit &apos; posts shouldnt even be allowed .
 take them to a reddit suggestion sub or something
 i have a simple proposition for a 36 filter system .
 i am so sick of this question .
 its literally one of the top posts of all time on here and i feel like i see it every week .
 before anyone else replies ,  i knew that this post was a joke before i posted my comment .
 i was complaining about the frequency of the other question in this thread but i must &apos;ve worded it badly
 i got a stiffy and a flopper reading that question op .
 nsfw for porn ,  nsfl for gore .
 it’s never going to happen .
 this has been asked for years ,  but them adding the tags would be them acknowledging that such content is prevalent on their platform .
 within 34 days this has become one of the most popular posts on this subreddit .
 this is the way .
 always has been .
 i like not knowing what i &apos;m about to get
 and then another for karma mining with rhetorical questions !
 pink for porn and red for gore
 can we get a fourth one for meta bullshit ?
 about the same as i &apos;d feel if askreddit banned  &apos;how would you feel &apos; questions: it would make no difference to me ,  since i only click on them when i know what i &apos;m getting into .
 and tell me what the filter names are/ will be pls .
 when i &apos;m feeling horny ,  i think i wouldn &apos;t want to see gore  .
 so that would be much appreciated
 don’t wanna see boobs when tying to have fun/s .
 i’m kidding but the idea is really good
 i wanna know if there putting cocks into vaginas or knifes into people
 sounds like a plan
  i’d have to see it in poll format to answer .
 i don’t mind filters if they allow more content .
 should be a filter
 why has this not happened already ?
 the fact that people have to ask this of reddit is rediculous 
 i can comment on this ?
 idk i kind of like the mystery will it be an ass getting plowed or will it be a decapitation the only way to find out is to click
 sounds good ,  but i also want a reddit filter that lets you block nsfw content from specific users .
 there are a few women who post in nsfw subs who i &apos;d very much not like to see naked more than once in my life ,  but i have no way of removing them from my general feed short of blocking them entirely (which i don &apos;t want to do) .
 i’d be for all three .
 i don’t want to see gore ,  nor repetitive posts .
 but maybe i’ll peek at something sexy !
 how would you feel about feeling things ?
 bad things ,  good things ?
 does that make you feel and if so how ?
 the stupid posts calling out repetitive posts are now themselves becoming repetitive and stupid .
 how deep shall it go ?
 but for real ,  questions like these are beyond stupid and pointless ,  and there’s no reason it should have 160k upvotes lol .
 but that’s reddit logic i suppose
 i never even see nsfw on the front page but god damn would i love would a politics filter so i don’t have to manually block 50+ subreddits
 this is the one
 this is a bit late , but can i get some free karma , i work hard
 i want nsfw for actual nudity ,  nsfl for gore and ansfw for the shit americans consider needs a nsfw flag currently because it &apos;s a woman showing her ankle or something .
 only if we end up with 4 nsfw filters .
 repetitive posts asking how you would feel about reddit adding 2 nsfw filters to distinguish between porn and gore ?
 passive aggressive /r/askreddit post about whatever is on the nerves of one redditor that most people don &apos;t give a fuck about .
 / karmawhore post .
 we need to go deeper
 all these people in the comments who didn &apos;t read the title lmao
 porn ,  gore ,  repetitive posts ,  and complaints about repetitive posts .
 because let &apos;s face it ,  this thread or a similar one always follows a question that people deem repetitive
 been using reddit for years and have never clicked on a post to be surprised with unexpected gore .
 guess i &apos;m not on the edgiest subs though .
 i mean ,  if you add the two filters ,  there &apos;s no need for the third one anymore .
 id add a fourth for posts complaining about repetitive posts ,  by people who spend too much time on reddit
 got me there for a second .
 i was like for the love of .
 if only we could filter  &apos;how would you feel if .
 people post gore on reddit ?
 isn &apos;t that like banned or something ?
 only gore i know of has been in quarantined or deleted subs .
 i &apos;d like a filter to distinguish being male and female nudity though .
 i would like a gore tag that i can turn off and never turn back on .
 green nsfw vs red
 it’s nfsw and nsfl .
 the reason the posts keep coming up is because reddit still hasn &apos;t made the change .
 can u post a pick of ur dick plzzzz im horny
 tags could be a start .
 just porn and gore
 tbh and more seriously just add a filter for animal harm and abuse it just do something to me i can &apos;t describe but i can &apos;t watch it
 i &apos;d like a filter for posts that think they &apos;re funny but aren &apos;t .
 nsfw ,  nsfl and nsfmd .
 (not safe for michael douglas)
 need:porn =/ updooted standard porn .
 & ,  a level for omfg .
 thankfully ,  as society evolves- the best porn recommendations come from women .
 seriously by far the best
 go to horny jail
 how about no filters so we can automatically access what we fucking want huh
 don &apos;t care still lots of other web sites out there .
 i would actually love that
 i am gonna be here for a long time
 that &apos;s awesome indeed
 and a fourth category consisting entirely of this post
 there &apos;s porn on reddit ?
 i honestly would be great .
 i &apos;m new to reddit and don &apos;t want to see the same thing one million times in less than an hour .
 stop protecting me from me .
 now these my kind of questions
 third most popular ask reddit of all time
 all i want is the hottest porn you can show me of every pornstar model there is
 yeah i guess that &apos;s alright ,  .
 i get triggered by gore way more than porn
 porn and gore is all
 i feel like making sure you dont get porn or gore are the better two you need to differentiate
 that would be helpful mostly because i &apos;m fine with gore but don &apos;t really want to see someones parts
 every horny person at the porn one: dew it !
 what i want to know is how this got so upvoted so quick !
 don’t think it’s that necessary ,  usually whatever someone writes will give you a hint as to what’s coming
 i’ve seen this 4 times in the past 2 months and each time i’m like holy heck this is controversial
 if ur concerned that the content u r looking at is nsfw maybe u should get off ur phone while ur at work .
 ya (minimum wage earning) bish
 i like to be surprised .
 this would actually be really good
 i could beat off to all of it so it wouldn’t matter
 i mean ,  if you want too .
 i’m pretty much indifferent about it to be honest ,  so i’m good either way .
 how much notifications do you get per day ?
 replacing the filter or adding multiple per post ?
 that makes a huge diffrence
 how about an actually useful function like  &apos;view all comments &apos;  .
 foh with stupid different nsfw filters
 this would be useful if i wanted to jerk off but i accidentally see a naked person .
 this would make a great addition to reddit because it would separate us lonely blooks from the masochistic blooks
 i &apos;m all for all 3 .
 i was literally thinking this the other day .
 i don &apos;t know man i like the risk because everytime i enter an nsfw post it &apos;s sorta like russian roulette like am i gonna be aroused or am i gonna see someone naked .
 we &apos;ve been trying to reach you about your car &apos;s expiring warranty .
 easy ,  nsfwp ,  nsfwg ,  and nsfwspam
 i believe there should be a fourth option of gory porn as well ,  just trying to be inclusive is all
 one for spoilers
 a podcaster i listen to told a story about youtube flagging him for adult content .
  he does astronomy amd physics .
  it isn &apos;t for children .
 but they shouldn &apos;t be harmed for watching .
 the only filter we need is a politics filter
 make one red make one pink problem solved
 i would block one the other 2 don &apos;t make me disgusted
 50/50 will be a lot easier .
 you &apos;re about to witness insert the type of content
 add it ,  add it ,  add it ,  add it ,  add it ,  addit !
 i like the surprise .
 don &apos;t add any filters .
 yes ,  we need this .
 although i do like seeing some titties every so often when scrolling reddit .
 i feel like it would be better to have switches in the menu on your account that blocks nsfw(porn) and nsfw(gore) while they &apos;re activated
 i would like that and i hate that your name acctually makes sence to my adhd mind
 what about if you shut the fuck up and stop asking dumb ass questions
 even better : add another that filters out us politics
 reddit ,  how would you feel ?
 i was about to downvote .
 how would you feel about reddit adding 4 nsfw filters to distinguish between porn ,  gore ,  and repetitive posts asking how you would feel about reddit adding 2 nsfw filters to  distinguish between porn and gore and meta posts asking how you would feel about reddit adding 3 nsfw filters to distinguish between porn ,  gore ,  and repetitive posts asking how you would feel about reddit adding 2 nsfw filters to  distinguish between porn and gore  ?
 at some point the title could be a tag instead .
 so long as it also filters “you live forever ,  but you were transported 2000 years in the past” posts .
 can i also add for consideration the posts that contain the following ,  .
 males / females of reddit what is a non-sexual thing that feels really good / turns you on / makes you want to gamble with your soul in a game of chess against the personification of death ?
 god those posts are so repetitive
  &apos;dear reddit ,  &apos; it started ,  .
  &apos;now do you agree - .
 that water &apos;s important ,  .
 and air should be free ?
 and would you allow .
 for a law ,  if you could - .
 that stated ,  and clearly ,  .
 that vaccines are good ?
  &apos;if maybe they gave you .
 a billion bucks - .
 would you own a chicken .
 that shits when it clucks ?
 would you take a cell phone .
 that screams when it rings ?
 or other such hugely .
  &apos;oh reddit ,  for queries .
 as complex as these - .
 for questions divisive ,  .
 i &apos;m begging you please - .
 i &apos;m watching ,  enraptured - .
 i &apos;m waiting ,  transfixed - .
 to read your responses .
 i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be mixed .
 i &apos;d cut my fucking toe off with a spoon for a billion dollars
 it fucking angers me how bad reddit is at hypotheticals .
 i love the hypotheticals game ,  i played it with my friends all the time .
 but somehow when reddit plays the hypotheticals game ,  it &apos;s like  &apos;you get all the money and power you want in the world ,  you get a beautiful home anywhere on the world ,  and every woman on earth will instantly fall in love with you .
 but your farts smell 20% worse .
  &apos; and somehow 50 , 000 people upvote it .
 makes me really angry .
 i don &apos;t know that i &apos;ve ever actually seen a legitimately interesting hypothetical on this sub .
 hey reddit ,  would you eat cereal with a spork for a brazillion dollars ?
 would you stay up alllll night long to be the richest person in the whole universe ?
 that was a decoy toe .
 would you break both your arms if you had a hot mom with soft hands ?
 should there be a filter for such posts ?
 am i imagining things or was there some deal about banning “how would you feel” posts ?
 or was that just a how would you feel post about banning how would you feel posts ?
 not bad and you .
 nsff - not safe for flint ,  michigan .
 nsfw new meaning : not safe for water
 ugh i hate it when i &apos;m jacking off and then a whole bunch of porn ,  gore ,  and repetitive posts ruin the mood
 have you looked at kinetico water systems ,  the official drinking water of the indiana pacers ?
 i legit can &apos;t decipher what the fuck op is asking .
 i want one that produces wine from water
 nestle will sue you out of existence
 how would you feel about a law that makes it illegal to kill kittens ?
 jfc means jesus fried chicken btw
  &apos;does anyone else think that objectively bad consumerist / pop culture phenomenon is bad &apos; .
  &apos;does anyone else think that  &apos;niche &apos; hobby popular on reddit like: video games ,  reading young adult novels as an adult ,  sitting inside on a rainy day with a blanket on while drinking hot cocoa is actually totally acceptable and that anyone who judges you for it is a jerk ?
 just ban  &apos;how would you feel about &apos; posts in general .
 i &apos;ve never seen one that wasn &apos;t a blatant attempt to farm karma .
 how would you feel about a nice glass of your beverage of choice ?
 that &apos;s like 50% of ask reddit questions .
 the other is questions about sex
 also questions about  &apos;how would you feel if they banned the  &apos;how would you feel &apos; questions &apos;
 i kinda want the mods to let people type in the text box again .
 at least it encourages questions with more substance by allowing context instead of the same 5 questions being asked over and over again .
 yeah ,  hate it when i &apos;m masturbating to nsfw and all of a sudden it gore or porn .
 one nsfw would be red and the other could be orange and white .
 i don’t care where i am if i accidentally open porn (other than around children) because i’m retired and i never have sound on .
 my old grandma ass can’t handle gore ,  though .
 fuck that gore shit .
 why not instead have 2 nsfw filters ,  one for repetitive and one for questions ?
 how about we just shoot posters who ask repetitive questions directly into the sun ?
 all i want is a humble brag filter because i am tired of the humble brag shit
 exactly ,  having three filters isn &apos;t speedy ,  we &apos;d need to read all these annoying repetitive posts and it ruins my life .
 i like a nice speedy life .
 how about we call these other ones  &apos;not speedy for life ,  &apos; we could even use the tag nsfl so people aren &apos;t too confused ,  it &apos;s only one letter away !
 i think animal abuse should have its own flair as well i can handle human gore but animal gets to me
 but what people want is a separate filter for gore .
 or am i missing something here
 reddit devs are saving it &apos;s release for the next time they ban a softcore pedophilia subreddit and they need to assuage a bunch neckbeards .
  reddit has made my arachnophobia so much worse .
  especially when it &apos;s a post on  &apos;aww &apos; and i &apos;m just like  &apos;why did you do this to me ?
 i read it without thinking on the words like i was in an exam .
 so although i read it i &apos;ve got no idea what i &apos;m talking about or what this thread is about .
 the other comment i made on this thread was about pandora &apos;s box .
 how even did i get there ?
 would you like reddit to have a filter for that ?
 well it is tagged nsfw
 i stroked reading this
  &apos;ten people died in the bronx last night due to a fire that killed 10 people last night ,  during a fire .
  &apos;fire officials say all 10 people died due to the fire ,  which was too hot for their bodies &apos;
 not safe for grammar .
 username checks out
 they &apos;re never going to do it in this particular case ,  cause it would be accepting that they allow such content ,  thus prompting news articles and probably getting a bunch of subs banned in the process .
 not to mention ,  it &apos;d break /r/fiftyfifty
 the fuck is nsfq ?
 i &apos;m so sick of these  &apos;how would you feel about xyz &apos; posts in general .
 it &apos;s always a popular opinion ,  but karma though .
 read the post again
 nsfs (not safe for sanity) for  &apos;how would you feel about &apos; posts
 can we also have one for poop and vomit ?
 i’d rather see nudity than bodily fluids but for some reason that’s never blurred
 i feel like this used to be how posts were labeled on reddit a few years ago .
 there it is ,  problem solved
 both would make me very uncomfortable as they &apos;d require competent mods and admin .
 which means there &apos;d have to be a violent coup or some sort of standards in place ,  both would be incredibly radical policy changes .
 you know there’s plenty of other colored thunderboltz out there you just haven’t met the right one yet
 yeah ,  i &apos;ve always thought that nsfw (not safe for work) was for porn and nsfl (not safe for life) was for gore and other traumatic things .
 good i don’t want to see porn just gore so i can distinguish:)
 then i &apos;m going to make your week !
 visit r/fiftyfifty for a real gas !
 or maybe a puppy .
 or maybe an actual decapitation .
 but then what do you do about gore porn‽
 and when you click the pink link a woman moaning is blared though the speakers and screaming bloody murder for red .
 you copy and pasted someone else’s answer ,  username does not check out .
 nsfa - not safe for americans
 this comment is passive agressive
 isn &apos;t that against the tos ?
 i &apos;m thinking  &apos;removed &apos; would be a good tag for those sorts of posts .
 or any of the ”reddit ,  will you accept two billion dollars for this minor inconvenience ?
 it should at least be  &apos;you live forever but you were transported to 65 million years ago ,  how do you stay sane &apos;
 should legally blind centenarians be allowed to drive ?
 they completely ruined askreddit .
 you have to sift through low effort garbage to find a decent thread .
 it &apos;s never  &apos;wake up 2000 years in the future &apos; because there &apos;s a lack of imagination .
 you’re under your alt ,  poem_for_your_sprog .
 this is a really clever poem .
 what’s funny is how difficult this would actually be .
 even with that billion dollar prize ,  it might be hard to keep going once you’re like 1/4 of the way through .
 i would use sand paper to remove my toe ,  snort it ,  poop it and then eat it for a billion dollars .
 i would even live stream it for you sick fucks .
 would you stub your toe for 2 dollars
 i &apos;d pay a brazilian dollar to eat cereal with a spork
 yes ,  the yes filter .
 used for every r/askreddit question which starts with “how would you feel about .
 insert instant fix to any minor life inconvenience” and “you get a billion dollars if .
 ” because the answer is always yes .
 they should be removed on basis of rule 5 .
 rhetorical and loaded questions (in which you are asserting an opinion ,  bias ,  or leading respondents towards expressing a specific opinion) will be removed .
 ) posts attempting to promote a specific agenda ,  to gain publicity ,  ( .
 ) or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed .
 they should just be banned .
 there’s a vote happening now with the mods following a discussion about this a few weeks ago .
 pandora &apos;s box entered the chat .
 i’m from michigan .
 this joke is really not relevant anymore tbh .
 they have fixed a lot of their infrastructure problems and i think reddit’s circlejerk about them not having clean water is kinda unnecessary and annoying at this point .
 that’s just my opinion though .
 nsfa - not safe for aachen ,  germany (people from aachen know what i’m talking about)
 this joke is out of date ,  they have cleaned up their water systems already .
 not safe for wastewater
 they’re suggesting that there is a lot of posts asking on ask reddit whether there should be 2 nsfw filters- one for sex and one for gore .
 they’re jokingly suggesting that there should be 3 ,  the two mentioned above ,  and the third to filter out such posts asking the same thing over and over .
 100 , 000 upvotes in a few hours so people are obviously keen on this one !
 that kind of shit needs to go on /r/unpopularopinion man .
 pump your breaks !
 even in self defense !
 i thought it was jentucky fried chicken .
 cena the president who was assassinated
 wait ,  so is that chicken fried in jesus ,  or is jesus the one frying ?
 jewish family and children services .
 i thought it was john f chicken
 ah yes ,  john fortnite cennedy ,  our only open minded president 
 i thought it was jesus fucked chickens ?
 the cringiest ones are the reddit typical self diagnosed depression posts:  &apos;does anyone get annoyed when they get out of bed at 2pm and the family says ,   &apos;hey !
 look who finally woke up !
  yes johnny ,  normal people don &apos;t stay up to 5am playing video games with the office on perma repeat in the background .
 i &apos;m gonna say it ,  if you don &apos;t drink your hot cocoa with whipped cream than you &apos;re a jerk .
 sex sexers of reddit ,  what sex sex sex you sex sex ?
 how would you feel about sex ?
 what tf do you put in your custom feeds ?
 and that &apos;s how fetishes are born !
 if you &apos;re lucky .
 this is the logical evolution of this joke
 i hate it when i &apos;m masturbating to gore and all of a sudden boom porn comes in
 - people who browse r/fiftyfifty
 yea ,  i love it when i &apos;m masturbating .
 orange and black for pornhub colors
 orange is reserved for spoiler tags .
 i have no words .
 old enough to be a grandma ,  but no kids and i &apos;m right there with ya .
 elbow bumps in solidarity
 or four filters !
 the joke is that it &apos;s a very common question on ask reddit:  &apos;would you like 2 nsfw filters ,  one for nudity and one for gore ?
  &apos; to the point that op has mockingly asked if we &apos;d like 3 nsfw filters: one for nudity ,  one for gore ,  and one for repetitive questions for this subreddit .
 from what i have seen recently ,  this post is a response to a post that appears frequently asking the question  &apos;should there be a separate tag for porn and gore ?
  &apos; ,  and is one made with sarcasm in mind .
  it isn &apos;t a real question .
 lmao fantastic comparison
 how would you feel about that ?
 lol i just read your edit ,  that’s hilarious .
 at least you’re not being graded on your comments !
 i think that &apos;s the porn filter
 but we need more information before we click otherwise it’s not my fault for having a stroke
 i read stroking this .
 it’s like trying to meet a word count on an essay
 not safe for q’berts .
 images containing springy snakes .
 not safe for questions ,  we’re turning askreddit to tell reddit
 not safe for quails .
 reddit has a growing quail userbase ,  and i think nsfq is a great feature to add to accommodate that !
 nearly safe for quokkas .
 especially the ones where the situation is incredibly nuanced ,  but reddit can only handle black and white thinking .
 like the popular  &apos;retest drivers after a certain age .
  &apos; yes ,  it &apos;s a great idea .
 but we have shit infrastructure in the us so you &apos;re essentially saying  &apos;how would you feel about grounding any elderly person who can &apos;t afford regularly taking cabs ?
  &apos; it &apos;s skipping a lot of important steps to make it a realistic possibility .
 they should go back to not giving karma for self posts ,  only links .
 the quality of content was so much better back then .
 i am sick of this comment .
 it &apos;s literally one of the top comments of all time on here and i see it every week .
 it &apos;s part of the discussion .
 read the comment again .
 hopefully they have some girth to theirs :(
 nffs for  &apos;no more of this ,  for fuck &apos;s sake .
 what subs are you subscribed to ,  my dude ?
 i rarely see that kind of stuff
 well ,  kinda now ,  because i think nsfl has been around a while ,  but no one uses it .
 in this case it should be r/thirdthirdthird .
 one third should be something cute .
 another third should be something gory .
 and the last third should be the generic askreddit question ,  the worst of them all .
 if you’re already looking for gore porn then i think you have bigger problems
 red ,  white ,  and blue .
 the resulting color is not supposed to be in my male vocabulary .
 i &apos;m supposed to only know the colors in ms paint .
 i never thought i would agree so much with someone that has a name like yeezelicious
  you should be in charge .
  we could say they got yeazeed .
 lol damn ,  you got my upvote !
 yeezy teaching us all .
 then people come in like ,   &apos;omg ,  that &apos;s my pet peeve .
 there &apos;s no amount of money that can convince me to eat ketchup on my steak .
 would you accept $100m but never be allowed to filter out those types of posts on reddit ?
 favourite stupid one of these was  &apos;someone offers you $100/hr to watch any movie on repeat ,  which one do you choose ?
 fucker ,  for $100 an hour you can pick the movie .
 goshly doo darn it !
 i &apos;ve been made !
 but really tho thanks for reminding me of the op ,  i just had this somewhere in discord and copy pasted it
 you like fucking friends with jane goodall or some shit ?
 a liberal muslim homosexual aclu lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on karl marx ,  known atheist .
 ”before the class begins ,  you must get on your knees and worship marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known ,  even greater than jesus christ !
 at this moment ,  a brave ,  patriotic ,  pro-life navy seal champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the united states stood up and held up a rock .
 ”how old is this rock ,  pinhead ?
 the arrogant professor smirked quite jewishly and smugly replied “4 .
 6 billion years ,  you stupid christian” .
 it’s been 5 , 000 years since god created it .
 6 billion years old and evolution ,  as you say ,  is real… then it should be an animal now” .
 the professor was visibly shaken ,  and dropped his chalk and copy of origin of the species .
 he stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears .
 the same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators .
 there is no doubt that at this point our professor ,  deshawn washington ,  wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor .
 he wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment ,  but he himself had petitioned against them !
 the students applauded and all registered republican that day and accepted jesus as their lord and savior .
 an eagle named “small government” flew into the room and perched atop the american flag and shed a tear on the chalk .
 the pledge of allegiance was read several times ,  and god himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country .
 the professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day .
 he died of the gay plague aids and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity .
 (this copypasta is not mine ,  i borrowed it from a post i saved a long time ago)
 what &apos;s this you &apos;ve said to me ,  my good friend ?
 ill have you know i graduated top of my class in conflict resolution ,  and ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions ,  and i have over 300 confirmed friends .
 i am trained in polite discussions and i &apos;m the top mediator in the entire neighborhood .
 you are worth more to me than just another target .
 i hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this earth .
 don &apos;t you think you might be hurting someone &apos;s feelings saying that over the internet ?
 think about it ,  my friend .
 as we speak i am contacting my good friends across the usa and your p .
 box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards ,  friend .
 the greeting cards that help you with your hate .
 you should look forward to it ,  friend .
 i can be anywhere ,  anytime for you ,  and i can calm you in over seven hundred ways ,  and that &apos;s just with my chess set .
 not only am i extensively trained in conflict resolution ,  but i have access to the entire group of my friends and i will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship .
 if only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you ,  maybe you would have reached out sooner .
 but you couldn &apos;t ,  you didn &apos;t ,  and now we get to start a new friendship ,  you unique person .
 i will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up .
 you &apos;re finally living ,  friend .
 i don &apos;t think i wanna drown in shit .
 this doesn &apos;t even rhyme
 so much violence ,  i like silly threats better .
 such as wishing for them to sit on a cactus ,  or threatening to find them and poop in all of their left shoes .
 i think you wanted the conservative love subreddit .
 it &apos;s one of u/poem_for_your_sprog &apos;s works !
 fuck you shoresy !
 you’d be surprised how sharp a spoon can get after 5 minutes on the concrete .
 good edge ,  a good rock for a hammer .
 two to three good whacks while your buddies hold you down .
 split 4 or 5 ways probably .
 i would stub 2 toes for a dollar at this point
 current exchange rate is 1 brazilian real = 0 .
 18 usd ,  not a terrible price for a bowl of cereal
 it would be way more interesting with a much smaller number .
 most people would push the  &apos;murder 1 random person for 1 million dollars &apos; button .
 but would you push the button for 10k ?
 honestly if they offered a 40 oz and a loosie i &apos;d probably smack that bitch twice and play edward 40 hands
 “how do you feel about genocide .
 would inarguably make some minor things easier .
 for the love of christ ,  please ban the  &apos;how would you feel &apos; posts ,  i &apos;m begging you .
 people are just using them to farm karma by posting pandering ideas and it is really driving down the quality of this sub .
 there are three  &apos;how would you feel &apos; questions (including this one) on hot in this sub as we speak .
 i opened pandora &apos;s box .
 give me my unforeseen problems .
 it sucks telling people i &apos;m from flint now because its literally the only joke anybody has .
 its better than the crime jokes i used to get but at least then i could deflect to some other example like chicago or shudders gary ,  indiana
 a common mistake ,  nothing to feel bad about
 chicken fried jesus
 that would be jfcs
 john f chickennedy
 ah ,  yes ,  that is a common use of the acronym as well .
 does anyone actually sip their hot cocoa with whipped cream as opposed to inhaling all the whipped cream off the top in one go ?
 what &apos;s the sexiest sex you sex ,  ladies ?
 dear the fairer sex ,  what &apos;s the sexiest sex you ever sexed ?
 that’s a good subreddit idea actually .
 he gets off on repetitive questions .
 minor osha violations that have yet to result in bodily harm
 you act like none of us have an alt for porn lol
 it’s a good way to remember it ,  too: .
 warning is red ,  shows someone who’s dead .
 orange and black ?
  it’s ok to whack .
 grandma’s a little rebellious 
 let’s take over the world !
 that &apos;s just called nsfw in my case .

  &apos;the bronx has many exports ,  chief among which are heroin ,  cocaine ,  and hipsters &apos;
 not safe for slinkies
 need for ,            .
 i usually unsubscribe from any community that posts these but they crop up random places because ,  well ,  poop is funny .
 just don’t want to see it
 r/poop and r/vomit perhaps .
 just so anyone knows before they click ,  the names of those subs are appropriate to their content .
 just found that one out through morbid curiosity .
 finding more gore porn apparently .
 i think it would be  &apos;pornpul &apos; yeah ?
 let alone spunk\_gargler .
 ninjaromeo throwing stars
 what a unifying post
 imagine his mother carried him in the womb for nine months just to name him yeezelicious
 “never judge a reddit user by their username .
 ” -abraham lincoln
 you got my downvote !
 crikey ,  the mate prolly doesn &apos;t live in austrelya .
 when in reality we &apos;d all eat the shit actively being defecated by a dog if it meant we &apos;d get $1m
 not worth it tbh
 you were supposed to destroy the karma sluts ,  not join them !
 bring balance to the subreddit ,  not leave it in darkness !
 for that price i &apos;ll hire someone to do it for me
 people have actually died like that :’(
 that &apos;s how you know it &apos;s not true
 fuck you u/nucklehead97 ,  i tried to cut your mom &apos;s toe off with a spoon for $5 but the smell of her foot fungus was so bad it gave me an existential crisis ,  made me question my whole life .
 i would want 95 percent in that scenario .
 buddies will be happy splitting 5
 i would stub all of my toes for $5 and a few tacos .
 i &apos;ll stub my toe tuesday for a dollar today .
 would you stub your toe for a billion dollars
 that’s the issue .
 too bad big numbers attract big upvotes .
 i would gladly genocide all the people flooding main subs with stupid posts like op &apos;s .
 error ,  your life has already to many problems ,  would you like to liberate some space by dying ?
 ha ,  with my anxiety i can foresee all the possible problems .
 check mate pandora’s box !
 you know that trope in anime where they bump into each other and fall and one ends with their head on other’s crotch or other compromising position .
 well that will happen with the next three opposite gender relatives you run into .
 i thought it was still contaminated glad to here otherwise ,  is it completely clean ,  or are there still problem areas
 i &apos;m trying to spread the message for you guys ,  but as you can see ,  there are still a lot of people that are misinformed .
 however ,  since this reddit ,  i hope terrible thing happens to you
 that &apos;s also fine ,  as long as you don &apos;t grab a spoon and eat the whipped cream that way before drinking as my father does you &apos;re fine .
 my comment was mostly meant vs people who don &apos;t even use whipped cream .
 (cause it &apos;s made of milk with a lot of sugar)
 proceeds to self brag about shit i didn &apos;t do .
 at risk of explaining the joke and ruining the humour ,  he &apos;s making a riff on /r/yourjokebutworse .
 /r/yourpointbutworse i agree would be a good subreddit but only if there &apos;s enough content for it ,  and i strongly suspect there is not .
 what tf do you put in your custom feeds ?
 so askreddit threads
 we certainly can &apos;t make it any worse than it already is !
 pulls out a crochet project and gets comfortable
 it seems it all is about strokes one way or another
 i thought the nsfw filter was a warning about stroking content .
 “we visited the bronx last summer .
 it was very fun .
 i saw a man laying in the street unconscious .
 he must’ve been very brave .
 hope you get better ,  bro .
 i’ve been here for a decade or so and i’ve never accidentally stumbled upon pictures of poop .
 just don’t sub to subs that post that kind of shit .
 not trying to shame a community ,  but i &apos;m just curious which subs specifically were posting this stuff ?
 like the outrage subs ,  edgy humor subs or something ?
 i just haven &apos;t even encountered poop as a concept on reddit since the poop knife guy back in what ,  2018 ?
 i &apos;m mostly subscribed to hobby subs and animal pictures ,  though .
 hey man ,  eventually everyone reaches an age when they agree with their mother .
 whoever screenshots this and puts it on r/rimjob_steve put me in the post
 wow ,  the first gold reward i ever got was for a comment that contained the text  &apos;spunk\_gargler .
 if someone in the past had predicted that might happen on reddit .
 i guess i would have believed them .
 no ,  i expected that one
 is this the free gold train
 let alone ensiform .
 he may gargle spunk but he spits fire
 some people like to enjoy the spunk they swallow dont act like you wish you hadn &apos;t just gobbled up your spunk like a starving holocaust victim
 i also choose this redditor &apos;s shit
 found phoebe buffay
 i’ve had points where i’d cut a fucking toe off for a taco .
 i &apos;m surprised we &apos;re not stubbin &apos; our toes for 5 bucks and eatin &apos; a few tacos right now .
 maybe you up vote my comment
 i hope youre holding your pinky to your mouth ,  because you are in my imagination
 i &apos;ll gladly kill all the mosquitos for a billion dollars then use that billion dollars to go after the guy paying for genocides .
 how many people you need to kill for it to be called genocide ?
  &apos;cause ,  i &apos;d have to think very hard up to about a thousand .
 where the accept button or do i need to fill out some terms of service first ?
 let me try the demo first
 every problem except the one you actually have to deal with
 at this point i feel like half the comments i leave on reddit are borderline copy-pastes of the same  &apos;no ,  our water is clean ,  they just have to finish up replacing some of the pipes &apos; talking points over and over again
 this is reddit ,  uhh ,  haha i &apos;m smarter than you !
 you cannot comprehend the difference in our intelligence !
 well ,  is it opposing force you &apos;ve never met ,  i would argue i &apos;m from jentucky and i find your comment highly offensive ,  because we don &apos;t have chickens here ,  it &apos;s all fake news ,  we only cook pigeons fat enough to look like chicken .
 and now i hope a equally bad thing happens to you while vaguely giving some idea it could be about hot sauce in your eyeball
 yeah baby don &apos;t stop i &apos;m almost there .
 dog shits and cookery subs .
 what are you doing crocheting when you &apos;re supposed to be taking over the world ?
 bruh i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s so funny to me ,  but i &apos;m losing it at the thought that for some reason no one else has this problem but this guy specifically is encountering vomit and shit every time you look through their feed
 fuck you shorsey !
 nobody ever uses that sub right
 except that subreddit isn &apos;t for inappropriate user names ,  it &apos;s when people with inappropriate names say something super wholesome .
 that &apos;s the whole point of the subreddit .
 and now you &apos;ll remember spunk\_gargler for the rest of your life
 i &apos;ll be walking through your front door in ,  say ,  -4 days to tell you the news .
 are you free then ?
 of course you are ,  it &apos;s the past .
 it describes my wang
 i just want fricken stubbed toes with fricken lasers attached to their fricken nails !
 this is the right answer .
 but would you do the same to the tusken raiders ?
 would you kill them all ,  every single one of them ?
 not just the men ,  but the women and the children too ?
 just go after every billionaire .
 there aren &apos;t many of them .
 yes you would or yes it is ?
 y’know ,  don’t answer .
 i know it’s going to be an inclusive or .
 says: no refunds .
 i felt that in my anxious soul .
 everyone who drinks dihydrogen oxide dies .
 if you were being serious my answer would be  &apos;thirty &apos; .
 thus proving your point i guess .
 what tf do you put in your custom feeds ?
 see ,  i was making a joke repeating a question (verbatim) to which the answer invoked repetitive questions .
 but if that &apos;s what you put on your feed ,  then mazeltov lol

 it was also super easy ,  barely an inconvenience even ,  to hold the dick harder than gamestop shares !
 yes ,  it is not often seen in the wild .
 i feel like reddit is almost self aware ,  but not quite
 didn &apos;t expect to see powfu here
 ahhh stop now it feels all weird !
 well yah ,  i’m retired ,  ima nap my ass off if i want !
 the problem with poverty is not usually day-to-day costs .
 people can adjust to that .
  it &apos;s unexpected expenses that are crippling .
 why are people still responding two weeks later !
 nobody is reading this thread any more !
 at least not the responses at the bottom (edit2: rant was too whiney .
 if you have something to say ,  who am i to say otherwise ?
 it would be better if they had to live with their lowest salaried employee for a month or two ,  imo .
 in their house ,  dinner with the family ,  travel to and from work together ,  same lunch ,  kids with homework ,  the works .
 building that relation would imo do much more for this problem than just  &apos;experiencing below your normal standard of living before returning to it &apos; .
 you &apos;re more likely to feel empathy for a family you know ,  and much less likely to forget them .
 anything else would just be another show about wealthy people having a fun adventure to talk about at cocktail parties
 i doubt a month is enough to really feel the effect
 it would be incredibly self-serving and boring .
 they would never truly experience what it is like to be in the precarious position of a minimum wage employee living hand-to-mouth and the  &apos;novelty &apos; is just salt in the wound .
 it would be more interesting to see the reverse .
 there was this similar themed show in hongkong and mainland china years ago .
 they swapped billionare with bottom feeders ,  let the rich do the basical job ,  on the lowest salary ,  to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort .
 nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere ,  regardless of how hard they worked ,  even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society .
 there was only despair ,  and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense .
 it stirred big debate among the society back then ,  and i think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled  .
 there was also another show in china ,  swapping senior political figures with community level council workers ,  to see how good they could do in each other &apos;s posts .
 the mayors were flooded by the angry mobs who kept asking for more and more benefits that were impossible to fullfil ,  by the end had to admit the amount of work at basic community level was too much to archieve anywhere .
 the show also got cancelled quite soon after a few episodes .
 3 months minimum and i &apos;d watch it .
 thanks for the gold !
 i love reality shows so i &apos;d watch it depending on who produces it .
 if it &apos;s too fake ,  with too many  &apos;emotional &apos; moments ,  advertising and people shouting ,  i &apos;m out .
 it’s more than just the money .
 it’s the lack of security these people endure .
 not knowing if you’ll lose your job tomorrow and having no savings .
 being kicked out of your home .
 an unexpected bill you can’t afford ,  which may lead to increasing debt .
 putting these rich people in a “poor” lifestyle for a month isn’t enough .
 even if they lost their money and homes ,  they’ll have such a huge network that they’ll be back on their feet in the time it takes for us peons to earn enough to eat for a week .
 they can never truly understand what it’s like to be poor or ever face that reality again .
 so what would happen ?
 it’d be a completely self-serving advert about how “now i realise that we need to do more for our employees .
 ” the workers get a small vanity bonus ,  probably give an immigrant worker with limited english a car ,  pat themselves on the back .
 then two weeks later ,  we’ve all forgotten about the show and they’ll go back to their old ways .
 isn’t this almost the same as secret millionaire ?
 do you guys have that in the us ?
 lots of rich people voluntarily go on vacation to third world countries .
 the catch is ,  they know they have a way out and an end date .
 i &apos;d be interested to watch a show where the ceo had to personally be financially responsible for the welfare of 50% of their lowest payed employees for 10 years ,  and their net growth percentage equalled their bonus every year ,  with a big bonus if both the company and the employees were profitable at the end .
 they would never do that though ,  because then they would have to admit that they don &apos;t pay a living wage .
 i &apos;d do more than a month and without any contact to rich buddies either .
 if it &apos;s a month ,  i think a lot would just buy rice and beans every day and go  &apos;see ?
 it &apos;s super easy to be poor !
 you just need to make economical choices !
 i &apos;ve proven myself right !
  &apos; longer than that and they &apos;ll really have to get used to how their lowest paid employees live .
 would they learn a lesson ?
 they still have a mansion to come back home to .
 they &apos;ll give their lowest paid people a one time bonus or maybe they &apos;ll drag one out in front of a camera to give them a fancy car so their own reputation gets better .
 and then they won &apos;t change anything else .
 1 month isn &apos;t long enough because no rent is due etc .
 they wouldn &apos;t have any trouble .
 most of them are self made and most have a large number of financial skills that 99% of people don &apos;t .
 they &apos;d micro their finances and come out better off than most people .
 you think someone like jeff bezos ,  or bill gates ,  or elon musk couldn &apos;t handle it ?
 or what about warren buffet ?
 the dude is already living a modest life .
 a lot of dumbasses in the comments seem to fail to realize that a lot of these billionaires were already in a super shitty position before ,  and pulled themselves out of it .
 these people run massive corporations and charities and you dumbasses seriously think that living your life for a few months would be a challenge ?
 that &apos;s some cringe .
 you should watch undercover billionaire on discovery (not to be confused with undercover boss) .
 billionaire glenn stearns moves to erie pa with just $100 ,  a truck and no contacts and has to make a company valued at $1 million in 90 days .
 he also can &apos;t mention who he is to anyone .
 it &apos;s pretty much exactly like you are describing and insanely entertaining .
 there was an episode of american dad where they tried to live on minimum wage for a month- it was fantastic .
 slumming is not living your entire life in a slum .
 here is what will happen:  .
 - fake billionaires like trump will come to this show .
 real billionaires will probably not .
 - those who appear on this show will brag about how they are self made and their employees could make do with even less .
 - we will find out ,  like naked and afraid ,  that outside of cameras these billionaires were living in their luxury rvs  ,  sipping martinis and having affairs .
 they would just treat it as a novelty since they know they will be getting their billions back at the end of the month .
 they wouldn &apos;t have to truly live like a person does who lives hand to mouth every day of their lives .
 they wouldn &apos;t really learn anything from it ,  in fact they would probably look back on it and laugh ,   &apos;oh remember when we had to eat that can of ravioli hahaha !
 they would have to swap everything down to the last detail .
 apartment ,  car (if they even have one) ,  wardrobe ,  food ,  hobbies ,  etc .
 and it would have to be on going ,  not just a couple months .
 the real question is: how to get a ceo to agree to this ?
 only if they also put a low level employee in the ceo &apos;s position to highlight that it &apos;s not all golf games and getting other people to do your work .
 depends if he is self made or not .
 self made rich people often know very well what it means to be poor and that &apos;s why they worked so hard to not be .
 i hate all reality tv that doesn &apos;t feature gordon ramsay
  day to day you can realistically only spen 5-10 out of pocket that even a minimum wage worker can deal with .
  but pro rate in the monthly costs ,  and it gets crazy .
 in my area a 1 bedroom in a bad area is still 1200 per month ,  or about $40 a day .
  transit for most people will be at least $5- and that is cost of mass transit to and from work; more if you drive (car ,  insurance ,  upkeep ,  gas) .
  not having a car is not always an option .
 on 40 hours at $10 an hour ,  you are bringin in about 1200 a month .
  you lose some of that to taxes ,  but lets be nice and say you get it all .
  you already cannot afford a studio apartment- so you need a roommate .
  so you have to hopefully find someone sane- but that is not a given .
 so basically ,  on your own ,  on a full time minimum wage job ,  you basically are eating garbage to just not be hungry .
  living with 2-3 roommates with the same problems you have ,  and will have no ability to save enough to ever make a difference .
  $500 is huge savings over a whole year for you- and that is not life changing at all .
 i recently found out the hard way that an ambulance ride is $2500
 yup ,  it &apos;d basically be like a camping trip .
 rough it for a month ,  then back to normal .
 rich people do this for fun .
 it &apos;s called the pacific crest trail .
 that’s how they could make the show more fun .
 set the person up in an apartment with a crappy car that would be roughly equivalent to what someone making minimum-wage be able to afford .
 then ,  like a week in ,  add a challenge .
 a flat tire or expensive car repair .
 an overdue bill that comes out of nowhere resulting in the electricity being turned off .
 maybe the heat goes off and they can’t get the landlord to respond .
 throw in an unexpected medical expense .
 i would totally watch the show .
 i remember times when i would have to choose between going to a dentist with tooth pain and buying new tires for my own safety .
 but i can see how it would be even harder for someone to choose say between eating that day and paying for their kid’s school supplies .
 this would be a good show .
 i &apos;d watch this .
 best idea so far
 and a camera team changes everything .
 i won’t trust doing business with a random nobody ,  but a guy in suit with a whole production team following him ?
 that’s a different story .
 that’s why “reality shows” are intrinsically just shows
 but it is just enough time to go “this is stressful .
 i’m gonna plan a trip to bali in 26 days from now”
 i think they &apos;d have to inject some kind of  &apos;emergency &apos; expense to feel it in such a short time .
 like the oven broke or surprise medical bill to show how a small thing can wipe your entire paycheck .
 then force them to miss a day of work for said  &apos;emergency &apos; .
 almost like  in monopoly ,  you pull a card and bam paycheck is gone .
 it might add appeal too for watchers since it introduces drama .
 this is also under the assumption that a company can operate without a ceo for a month ?
 depending on the company that could sink the entire ship .
 people want to paint these wealthy people as villains when in reality a lot of the time they &apos;re operating within the fucked up bounds and laws we designed .
 it &apos;s a lot easier to say  &apos;hang the rich !
  &apos; than  &apos;comprehensive tax reform ,  universal healthcare ,  take money out of politics ,  and no double standard for white collar financial crimes !
 the show would be stupid and shallow .
 watching an individual suffer to make ourselves feel better while simultaneously affecting zero practical change .
  or  &apos;trading places &apos; ,  as we called it back in the  &apos;80s .
 the reverse is called the lottery and we know how it usually plays out .
 what &apos;s the show ?
 and are there ways to find it online ?
 i wish they had done these shows in the us ,  say ,  10-15 years ago .
 entertainment media can get away with a little more here ,  and undercover boss was popular enough i think the audience would be satisfactory to whichever network it landed on .
 it might have pushed things forward a little bit more .
 what &apos;s the name of that show ?
 i want to watch it .
 i think i know what show you’re talking about .
 my aunt and youngest cousin from hong kong were on it or at least a very similar reality show .
 they aren’t billionaires ,  but they are very wealthy .
 they lived with a poor mother and daughter .
 my cousin is now interesting in filmmaking and i wonder if it’s partly do to this show .
 one thing that stayed with me from the show was that they tried to play up their wealth by saying my cousin had “an american tutor” .
 but it was actually my mom helping my cousin over skype figure out classes for when she’d apply for american high school .
 germany had a small experiment maybe 45 minutes film doing something like that over 3 days (making it from a homeless person &apos;s resources)  .
 two suffered the third though .
 doesn &apos;t hesitate a second immediately grabs the closest charity poster he can find begs for 5 euro ,  goes to a copy shop and copy &apos;s the damn thing in various sizes ,  goes to the closest cafe and asks if he can use one of their tables to promote the charity and collect some donations .
 then goes on to collect a few hundred euro and goes  &apos;meh i don &apos;t see the problem &apos;
 nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere ,  regardless of how hard they worked ,  even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society .
 there was only despair ,  and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense .
 it stirred big debate among the society back then ,  and i think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled .
 oh that would definitely get cancelled in the us too .
 a country where half the people think they’re temporarily embarrassed millionaires ,  and they’ll all some day reach the success of a bezos or a gates if they just pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work hard and anybody who isn’t paid well just hasn’t worked hard enough .
 if one of them came down and worked at walmart for a while and came to the conclusion of “i can’t do this” ,  it’d rustle too many feathers .
 with problem scenarios thrown in .
 broken down car .
 the wheels would come off pretty quickly
 and they can’t choose february as one of their months .
  although i’d like to see them have to have december so they have to deal with christmas
 “sure ,  i had to resort to being a homeless cannibal for 10 weeks but it really wasn’t that bad .
 it’s not the same thing .
 they would be doing it for other motives .
 and their image .
 they could easily do a .
 month for good publicity .
 still too short a time to make these multi-millionaires realize the reality of living on minimum wage .
 one year might do it ,  though .
 and they have to do the same job as the employee .
 x-factor- singer: “i can’t sing but my granny died an hour ago and told me to follow my dream .
 hosts: “you son of a bitch ,  i’m in !
 i fucking hate that “emotional moment” bullshit .
  kitchen nightmares and bar rescue used to be great now i can’t even watch them .
 same with undercover boss .
 imo that is the biggest difference between uk and us shows .
 i love reality shows .
 if it &apos;s too fake ,  with too many  &apos;emotional &apos; moments ,  advertising and people shouting ,  i &apos;m out .
 are there reality shows that aren &apos;t like this ?
 yeah ,  if it´s obviously fake ,  that´s a big nono .
 another issue i have with scripted reality tv shows is that ,  before each commercial break ,  they basically sum up the plot progression for the part that follows after the commercial break ,  then there´s two commercials ,  then they sum up the part prior to the commercial break ,  and then they show the part they have summed up less than 5 minutes ago .
 if it &apos;s too fake ,  with too many  &apos;emotional &apos; moments ,  advertising and people shouting ,  i &apos;m out .
 it doesn’t sound like you love reality shows ;)
 i hate it when they put in  &apos;emotional music &apos; .
 hate it because it actually works ,  despite best efforts to not get emotional .
 if you haven’t seen it ,  i’d recommend “the act of killing” .
 it’s a documentary following an elderly man who was once a member of an government sanctioned anti-communist death squad in indonesia .
 now ,  the commies are defeated ,  he’s celebrated in his own country .
 there’s a scene where they had him do a mock up of a torture/execution method he had used .
 he asked production to hold because he found it traumatic .
 in a very raw moment ,  he asks the question ,  “is this what my victims were feeling in their last moments ?
 the producer responds ,  “no ,  what your victims were feeling was much worse ,  because you were able to ask us to stop ,  and they knew there was no escape .
 you can see in a couple of seconds it changes the guy’s whole world view .
 i would imagine a billionaire who has been rich for most or all of their adult life ,  equally ,  would have trouble conceiving of the dread of inescapable poverty .
 your entire last paragraph is every episode of undercover boss .
 you raise a really good point .
  the producers should ‘fire’ the ceo half way through the show and let them try to figure what the hell they should do .
 the ceo would just think  &apos;once i get through this 4 weeks i &apos;m back to normal &apos; when in reality people don &apos;t have this .
 they wouldn &apos;t know what it would be like to be in that person &apos;s shoes for an extended period of time ,  not knowing when it &apos;s gonna end
 it’s more than just the money .
 it’s the lack of security these people endure .
 yeah ,  for this to work they should sign them up for a month of real life and at the end tell them there was a paperwork mistake or their firm likes it better that way so they &apos;re not getting their old life back .
 then the actual show begins .
 yeah a slightly different premise though as op &apos;s suggestion is for the salary to be what the person pays their employees (to encourage some awareness of their livelihood ,  i guess) ,  rather than the minimum wage of the country .
 there was a tv show in the us where a billionaire was given an old pickup truck and and $100 and then had to build a business worth  a million dollars in 90 days with no access to any resources (besides the pickup truck and the $100) .
 it was really interesting .
 nah ,  all they have to do is stick it out for a month and then they can say from personal experience that it isn &apos;t that bad .
 of course ,  they never have to deal with the effects in the long term .
 it &apos;s kind of like when privileged college students pretend to be homeless by camping out in the quad for a night .
 some ceos are such sociopathic cyborgs that theyd just sit there starving half to death and not let on that it sucks for the whole show just to say that it isnt that bad
 so basically undercover boss
 indeed ,  one year more be more fitting .
 one month is nothing .
 stan ended up being a drug addict in three days right ?
 to your last point ,  that &apos;s why i like the idea of a wager ,  either he pulls it off legitimately without cheating or he pays a penalty to the employee or employees ,  such as his bonus is distributed amongst the company .
 they would treat it like going on safari .
 all you need is a $500 crown victoria ,  sacrifice some living space ,  and buy cheaper food ,  but otherwise it wouldn &apos;t be that tough .
 they would also have to be allowed to make different decisions on the starting conditions .
 you &apos;re not proving anything by dropping a ceo in the position of a minimum wage worker who is underwater on their car payments and behind on rent and watching them struggle ,  if the ceo would have chosen a different car and smaller apartment .
 then when the company goes belly up ,  they get to tell all the employees they no longer have a job
 minimum wage jobs are for children .
 you need to get out and apply yourself for something better .
 even waiting tables at applebee &apos;s pays more than minimum wage .
 i think a big part of americans in debt is the healthcare system .
 even if you have insurance you can pay thousands for a routine procedure for each person in your family ,  every year .
 i had a check up when i was pregnant ,  turns out the procedure was 500$ out of pocket .
 it was such a scam .
  it wasn’t even in the same calendar year as my labor so i spent thousands over my pregnancy .
 and then rich people would suddenly feel better about themselves because  &apos;being poor isn &apos;t that bad ,  i did it myself &apos; .
 well ,  that and the scripted and edited parts .
 nathan for you really demonstrates the effect being on tv has on people .
 people agree to some outlandish shit for their business just because he &apos;s on a tv show .
 watch rich house/poor house on youtube .
 the uk already has a show exactly like this .
  &apos;just wipe with low denomination bills .
 like 20 &apos;s or something &apos;
 jeff would just whip out his amazon prime and order some tp for same day delivery .
  &apos;i mean ,  it &apos;s one banana ,  michael .
 how much could it cost ?
 up next season on the surreal life .
 (the train wreck is pulling into the station .
 next day: due to technical difficulties resulting from amazon not owning walmart ,  it was decided that there would be a merger .
 listen ,  just give me the cash and i’ll go get some and bring it back .
 there’s probably no change .
 we probably need paper towels too so toss in another $25 , 000 for that .
 no no ,  no need to thank me”
 anyone remember  &apos;the simple life &apos; with paris hilton & nicole ritchie ?
 the show was supposed to be a  &apos;let &apos;s watch these rich people work on a farm or minimum wage jobs like serving fast food and see how they like it .
 these spoiled brats would do a few minutes of work ,  whine about it and then just screw around because they didn &apos;t give a shit about getting fired or not .
  all it did was give these spoiled rich people more attention that they didn &apos;t deserve
 undercover boss was fantastic propaganda .
 ##see how i ,  the benevolent overseer employer ,  can relate to my chattel employee .
 i may even select one of my herd and grant them a tiny portion of my personal fortune .
 see how much joy is on this peasant &apos;s face as they are finally able to afford basic necessities !
 i am a good lord .
 what i didnt like about undercover boss was it ended in grand gestures for a few select employees .
 instead of raising wages or improving employee retention ,  the boss would like buy a house for the single mother manager who lost her house in a tragic fire or like give a scholarship to that 19 year old hard working employee that attends school full time also
 undercover boss was bizarre in how blatant its propaganda was .
 like an orwellian novel suddenly manifested
 don &apos;t forget the pay rent or buy food dilemma scenario .
 “you have died of dysentery .
 well with a broken down car ,  the wheels have already come off
 and they have no access to the amenities of their former wage .
 broken down car  ?
 he would have to do his commute in public transport full of other people also going to work and deal with delays and strikes as he wouldn &apos;t have money to afford a car
 the big problem with poverty is that indeed all those problems arise and have to be taken head on .
 but without any better future in sight .
 it makes you numb .
 a billionaire can mentally better cope with that as he can count down the days until the hardships will be over .
 real life for the rest of us  ?
 i want to watch this .
 somebody produce this show right now !
 and no scripted crap .
 just real life hitting him in the face
 with an hour commute both ways .
 ooo and throw in a wager .
 the employee chosen for the ceo to bare the salary is given the months salary of the ceo if the ceo quits before the end
 you know many tv channels that would get a child sick for audience ?
 to be honest i don &apos;t want to know the answer to that
 imagine the ceo of walmart working for walmart in the holiday season ,  november december ,  january
 well ,  that &apos;s the thing .
 i love the idea in theory ,  but they &apos;ll just feel good about themselves for surviving it and say if they can do it ,  so can these poors .
 also there &apos;s nothing real in reality tv .
 so bottom line ,  i think there &apos;s a good chance it could do more harm than good - make the billionaires look good and the poor people look like whiners (to anyone who could do something about it) .
 i &apos;ve heard the saying  &apos;i can handle anything ,  anything at all ,  for one minute .
  &apos; now ,  i don &apos;t believe that &apos;s true (at the very least ,  for me) ,  but the idea is exactly that - it &apos;s not so bad to do it .
 it &apos;s when you have to keep doing it ,  that it becomes the real torture .
 the  &apos;drop of water on the head &apos; torture ,  for reference .
 a thousand ,  a million ,  so many you &apos;ve lost count ?
 and they would know that they just have to make it through this month/few months and then go back to their comfy life .
 us low paid workers have none of that to look forward to .
  just more shitty poverty .
  forever and ever .
 nobody would ever do this
  &apos;here we have elliot .
 elliot is a down &apos;s syndrome paraplegic who got disfigured when his plane crashed on the way to his dream vacation .
 he spent the next 4 months in a medically induced coma while the doctors found a replacement for his dick that got torn off .
 also ,  he can sing moderately good .
 gimme that golden buzzer !
 this is why i can &apos;t watch many car shows anymore .
  &apos;if we don &apos;t get this engine to run ,  we &apos;re going to lose the shop !
  &apos;after 6 seconds ,  tommy found that the coil wire had popped off .
  we put it back on and the car runs great .
 now i just watch the motor trend originals like roadkill ,  roadkill garage ,  dirt every day ,  and faster with finnegan .
  they don &apos;t do that fake tv drama bullshit .
  since a few others have pointed this out ,  youtube has some great content .
  personally ,  i enjoy smoking tire ,  doug demuro ,  cleetus ,  rob pitts ,  ed bolian ,  and a few others .
 have you ever watched the og british kitchen nightmares ?
 he goes in ,  teaches them how to improve their food ,  teaches them how to manage a buisness then does a bit of advertising .
 he is a lot meaner to us than the americans .
 undercover boss is one of the worst blatantly  scripted shows i &apos;ve ever seen
 but the music tells me how to feel !
 there is not a single thread of emotions in any such scene .
 literally just hate all the drama to garner attention and drive huge no of viewers
 everyone fucking cries now .
 if you cried in the first few seasons they would laugh you out of the room .
 now they talk about crying shows passion .
 anything they invest in takes off it &apos;s a free 20 minutes prime time infomercial on a major network .
 undercover boss was my guilty pleasure ,  but then they went and forced the emotional side ,  and spoiled it completely .
 bar rescue has always been so fake .
 idk how people believe these shows when the  &apos;hidden &apos; cameras are so obvious .
 not only that but that guy is so obnoxious i could tell from the first five minutes it was fakr
 i noticed this watching kitchen nightmares uk .
 in the uk version ,  it seems like gordon really is trying to help people .
 intense moments are for passion .
 the us version is cut with dramatic music ,  and i can’t watch it anymore .
 americans need to have that emotional hook .
  brits are cold hearted bastards
 yeah ,  they &apos;re called documentaries .
 forged in fire is good .
  i &apos;m struggling to think of any others .
 you forgot the depressing part where he is the only one to have any sort of realization like that .
 the other guys had no such realization ,  or mabe they had one years ago and didn &apos;t care .
 that gave me the chills .
 what was the execution method in question ?
 hate that i &apos;m curious about this
 and that &apos;s exactly what would happen here .
  they &apos;d fluff it with a feel-good donation from ceo and then in a month nothing changes in their corp .
 it would all be publicity for the company
 i liked the idea of the show .
  but  &apos;fred the hippy &apos; shows up for his first day of work with his customary camera crew .
  so we scour the company with a  &apos;best sob story &apos; contest .
  we have that person train fred and be extra nice while a few unsuspecting slobs get mad at this weirdo for interrupting their workday and get portrayed as the villain .
 it would be better with undercover cameras even if quality sucks .
  skip the feel good stuff .
 undercover boss was insidious propaganda disguised as feel-good programming .
 makes me wanna hurl
 that wouldn &apos;t work because the ceo knows that it &apos;s just a show and that everything is going to be good in 3 months .
 an actually realistic show would be impossible .
 then the ceo &apos;s mother should fall sick and they have to take on a caretaker role .
 meanwhile their child has a run in with the law and  .
 this is just the book of job .
 let &apos;s put the ceo through the book of job .
 i &apos;m there for it .
 at the end of four weeks ,  we get paid and the cycle begins all over again .
 it’s just that their pay cheque for that month totals what i’ll earn in a few decades .
 yeah ,  that still wouldn &apos;t matter .
 they have their friends and family and the entire social network that would easily get their life back on track .
 except they can just quit and use their connections to get another job .
 i haven &apos;t seen it in a few years but this was the premise .
 they have fuck-all and get put up in a shitty flat and given a few pounds to survive and basically see what happens .
 of course ,  they never have to deal with the effects in the long term .
 yes ,  this is definitely a problem .
 and this is where the show throws a curveball .
 instead of a month ,  it &apos;s actually 6 months and they just pretended to make it a month so as to see the ceo &apos;s reaction to finding out it &apos;s actually 6 and his reaction would give us his/her real thoughts on the matter .
 a month of low nutrition food and financial insecurity can be easily recovered from .
 yeah you can miss one rent payment without much incident .
 if you miss several you &apos;re kicked out of the apartment .
 well it wouldn &apos;t be that bad .
 one of the worst things any being poor is the stress and uncertainty about the future .
 they won &apos;t exist for them because in 30 days they get their billions back .
 they &apos;ll just eat their ramen stress free for a month then be rich again .
 yup ,  i &apos;m guessing it &apos;ll go like that .
 one happy crying person with a dark past who gets a car brings in viewers .
 a thousand people whose past you don &apos;t know who are satisfied ,  but not ugly crying at a pay raise will not .
 and i doubt they &apos;ll just do the right thing because it &apos;s right .
 they &apos;ll want something back for it ,  both the ceo and the tv network it would be shown on .
 at least ,  that &apos;s what i think would happen .
 but he got a brand new pontiac aztec
 but saying you need to live in a shit hole for 1 month is a lot easier than saying you’ll need to live their for an indefinite amount of time .
 i had a split with an ex .
 and had to move out quickly after we moved to a new city for her job .
 before i had one .
 found a place that included utilities for $500 a month .
 it was cheap and knew i’d find a good job with a month .
 but slept awful .
 had to deal with an awful roommate .
 really bad living situation .
 if that was long term ,  i couldn’t have done it .
 knowing it was temporary has a huge impact on how you can handle something bad .
 nearly every  &apos;hidden camera &apos; show ,  probably at least 80-90% of them ,  are not really hidden camera either ,  you really think the production team can find such good hiding places (with the right camera angles and lighting ,  and sometimes even moving cameras) for a dozen+ cameras that the people being filmed don &apos;t notice them ?
 all of those shows are bullshit ,  they are ultimately entertainment and any purported  &apos;truth &apos; is twisted to fit that purpose
 its not a proper trade when they can see the end in sight after two weeks .
 i put it in my favorites and will now wait until someone ads legible sub-titles in eglish or until i learn cantonese/mandarin .
 unfortunately it is more likely that i will learn a new language before anyone translates it !
 is there any in mandarin ?
 there was a uk show where celebs lived with benefit claimants for a week ,  only  a few episodes .
 one was boris johnson &apos;s sister ,  the journalist .
 i remember she criticised the woman for smoking bootleg cigarettes on £70 a week ,  what a waste of money .
 at the end she said there was no wonder she smoked ,  life was so hard and miserable ,  and she &apos;d smoke as well in that situation .
 people kept petitioning for the likes of ian duncan smith to live on £70 and see how far he gets .
 still think that &apos;s a pretty good idea for all m .
 ps who affect policy
 i watched an episode of that show .
 it was basically: here &apos;s a sleeping bag ,  here &apos;s a homeless person to guide you around ,  now go camping in the rich part of london for 3 days and our camera team will guard you .
 and after one day they all broke down  &apos;i can &apos;t do this i &apos;m going to die &apos; .
 he &apos;s unlikely to carry cash ,  so maybe scrape it with a card .
 does this do contactless ?
 arghh get in here and do this for me .
 i don &apos;t do this .
  &apos;watch the hilarious hijinx when .
  it &apos;s not delivered on the same day .
 it &apos;s delivered to the wrong address .
 it &apos;s delivered to the correct address ,  but stolen off the porch
 yeah ,  he &apos;s rich ,  not stupid .
 i &apos;m pretty sure paris hilton said a bit ago ,  the entire show was scripted .
 i’m pretty sure the target market was people that wanted to ogle at the girls .
  they were like the last people you’d pick if you wanted a show like that to that to present the topics seriously .
  if anything it almost implied justification for the rich/poor divide .
  it implied being poor made you a better person than a rich person ,  which is neither true or helpful .
  just to clarify ,  i’m not saying being rich makes you better either ,  just that it’s (at least mostly) independent of your financial status .
 it was a comedy .
 paris and nicole are much smarter than they portray in the show ,  they are characters .
 that was also extremely scripted !
 it was a dumb show ,  and i don &apos;t necessarily think they &apos;re geniuses or anything .
 but paris and nicole are obviously way smarter than the characters they were playing .
 everyone keeps saying undercover boss was good propaganda .
 that show still comes on .
 i watched a new episode about anytime fitness back in january .
 wasn &apos;t it just heartwarming how every person the boss got put with had an easily solvable life drama that they could throw some money at ?
 just great coincidence ,  i guess .
 undercover boss is pure fucking dystopian propaganda .
 oh ,  yes your lives suck ,  but one of you gets a small one time lottery win by being the token poor person chosen to get some false heartwarming bullshit while there’s no actual positive change for anyone .
 doesn’t that feel good everyone ?
 your rich rulers learned a lesson about your miserable lives !
 why raise wages when it &apos;s a better feel good story to have the ceo buy becky ,  the single mother working 2 jobs who takes care of her grandmother on life support ,  a new ford escape ?
 i mean i absolutely agree with you ,  but understand that undercover boss was just a show that gave companies an opportunity at a huge pr stunt that people would watch intentionally under the guise of entertainment .
 (i watched like a ton of them ,  so no judgment here) .
 so the grand gestures were meant to make the viewer feel things .
 making actual overall improvements doesn &apos;t tug at your heartstrings as much ,  which was unfortunately the goal of the pr stunts .
 my complaint exactly--the show turned into a feel good circle jerk without actually making any needed changes .
 although shoutout to the norwegian cruise line guy who actually did implement some corporate changes iirc .
 i’m not saying it was a good show ,  i’m just saying it might indicate that it’s easier to slip this kind of thing in to us entertainment than chinese entertainment
 what i didnt like about undercover boss was it ended it grand gestures for a few select employees .
 this country loves  the myth of the redeemable slaver
 the one for second cup - one of the workers pissed off the boss - she donated to a charity in his name (if i &apos;m remembering right) .
 other guy got  &apos;coffee college &apos; paid for him - the  &apos;school &apos; you need to go to before you can get your own franchise .
 great for him ,  but also still benefiting the company ,  so eyeroll
 same ,  instead of improving all employees lives by a little bit they went overboard and changed one persons .
  gratz to that person ,  but if i was their co worker making the same pay i’d feel a little pissed .
 solved that one years ago .
 just buy ramen noodles and eat two packs of that every day until youre caught back up on rent .
 pay rent every time .
 i can skip a few meals as long as i have a roof over my head .
 just suck the landlords dick .
 saw it work in a porno once
 let &apos;s also add in the housing loan bill being overdue and now they &apos;re just a couple of days away from being dragged out of their homes .
 what if the front fell off ?
 when figuratively meets literally .
 especially the networking factors .
 can &apos;t just call up your billionaire buddy to grant you a small loan of a million dollars .
 see ,  that &apos;s why you give them a car first and then they have to take public transport .
 it would really drive the point home .
 put them in small town middle america .
 no public transportation
 public transport on strike the very day their car breaks down .
 the other problem  with this idea is that the billionaire doesn &apos;t carry the emotion al baggage .
 soon as the show &apos;s over he goes back to being a billionaire .
 it &apos;s short term pain at best ,  not the ongoing worry of  &apos;but what if .
 we’re talking about reality tv here .
 what do you mean by “no scripted crap”
 they &apos;d give it to them anyway as a feel good finale .
 they don &apos;t have to actually get a child sick .
 they could just send in a child actor and tell them to be the biggest asshole ever .
 don &apos;t worry ,  it &apos;s america .
 paying a child actor is probably cheaper than a real sick child &apos;s medical bills
 imagine bezos working for amazon in the same period .
 nah if you really wanna punish them make them work january to march .
 while the holidays are bad ,  after the holidays the company cuts hours down so bad that some people only get to work two days a week .
 especially considering the fact that a) the billionaire knows that it &apos;s temporary ,  and b) they &apos;ll kill the show or fake things if things get too out of hand for him to handle .
 no way in hell the producers would let the billionaire stay a month in a homeless shelter .
 this is so true .
 i’ve done the ration challenge which is a fundraiser where you only eat syrian refugee rations for a week ,  and i can’t emphasise hard enough that the only thing keeping me going was knowing it was only 7 days .
 doing something temporarily does not affect you in any way like the real thing does .
 i can’t imagine what it would be like to live off those rations indefinitely .
 and although they have to deal with the lower quality of life ,  they don’t have to deal with the crippling stress of how they will pay their bills etc .
 which is much much worse than a month of shitty food .
 they &apos;ll never live like common people .
 they &apos;ll never do what common people do; they &apos;ll never fail like common people .
 they &apos;ll never watch their lives slide out of view ,  and dance and drink and screw ,  because there &apos;s nothing else to do .
 cut their hair and get a job; rent a flat above a shop .
 smoke some cigs and play some pool; pretend they never went to school ?
 still ,  they &apos;ll never get it right ,  cause when they &apos;re lying in bed at night watching roaches climb the wall ,  if they called their dad he could stop it all .
 also ,  he had a tryout with the judges &apos; recording company a month ago .
 i miss the powerblock tv how-to shows on sunday mornings .
 they were no bullshit ,  straight forward ,  ‘here’s a project and how to do most of it’ shows with a little advertising thrown in at the end .
 darn i miss old fast and loud .
 that kind of shit ruined tanked for me .
 so many “we have a catastrophe and if it doesn’t get fixed soon the whole tank is ruined .
 ” then after the commercial break everything is fine .
 haha ,  i felt like i was the only one to notice that shit ,  like ,  every episode they &apos;re like  &apos;this is the biggest job weve had guys do not fuck this up &apos; and right after the commercial break they fix their problem and the show goes on ,  and uh oh ,  the same thing happens next episode and it &apos;s like you have a tv show and a car shop ,  if you &apos;re hurting for money you &apos;re doing something wrong .
 same with me and most all hunting/fishing shows .
 99% is product pitches and guitar riffs .
 recently i started watching meateater with steve rinella and love it .
 turns out ,  it &apos;s made by zero point zero productions ,  who also made all of anthony bourdain &apos;s shows and i was a die hard fan .
 it &apos;s got a really similar vibe ,  especially after the first season .
 most important ,  the editing isn &apos;t the absolute most obnoxious thing imaginable .
 intense music and chop cut-chop cut-swoosh noise-chop cut ,  don &apos;t go away because after commercials kitchen .
 waiter throws something cooking .
 woman crying ramsay .
 shot of ramsay walking out the door while calling someone a donkey loud noise ,  knives on screen ,  fire in background .
 aahhhhh- car insurance commercial
 not to mention you get the high-brow ,  not-so-classy-but-oh-so-fancy british snark and sass which is just jolly good fun all around .
 ramsey is also a lot more emotive and easy to connect with in the british one as well because he isn’t all-in on the rage and insults like the american version
 yeah ,  it’s blatantly obvious the american producers got their hands on it ,  the older series is legit ,  with legit arguments
 what ,  you don &apos;t usually receive 54 yo interns in your factory that are being followed around by a camera crew ?
 i read a reddit post by someone whose business was on ub a while back ,  they said that everyone knew immediately that they were on ub .
 it &apos;s not necessarily scripted at first ,  but everyone still acts oddly because i mean .
 it &apos;s clearly a tv show .
 so people don &apos;t wanna be caught doing their job shittily .
 ehhhhh it depends on the episode .
 i was on the show ,  and they told us they were filming for a different show .
  &apos;but then they went and forced the emotional side ,  &apos; .
 s1e1: hi new guy ,  did you know that my dad has cancer and my cat is sick .
 i have really been striggling financially since this job has me supporting my 3 younger siblings .
 obviously hyperbolic ,  but i don &apos;t have the exact quote from s1e1; there was still some sort of emotional/personal/financial issue that 1-2 of the workers had .
 by the end of the episode both had received bonuses/additional support ,  blah blah blah .
 there is no  &apos;reality &apos; in that reality tv .
 along with all the disbelief you have to suspend in  &apos;here is this new hire you need to train ,  who is totally just some random guy; and by the way he has a film crew with him .
 dude ,  matt straight up sucks !
 you mean on episode two ?
 the formula became apparent way early .
 great idea for a show ,  but too predictable in the types of employees who are featured .
 shut it the hell down .
 also i think he is contractually obligated to not blink while on camera .
 our (american) competition shows is basically sob stories .
 especially cooking competition shows .
 everyone has a sad reason they need to win $10 , 000 .
 as a american ,  i don’t understand why the shows do that .
  i don’t want to see the fake emotion .
  when i used to watch undercover boss ,  if the employee started to tell their sob story my dvr would fast forward .
  all i wanted to see is the boss being incapable of doing their employees jobs and hopefully having compassion for them .
  top chef is one of the few reality shows that doesn’t seem to have as much of the sob stories .
 it is about cooking and being the best .
 american tv is borderline unwatchable .
 the manufactured drama could drown at least 2 seasons &apos; casts of drag race .
 take forged in fire ,  for example .
 good idea ,  generally entertaining .
 one backwards cymbal fade to black from being a survivor spinoff .
 we all agree trust me lmao
 this was what i had exactly in mind when i posted my comment .
 also ,  the next top model franchise .
 we drink tea to warm our hearts .
 we drink a lot of tea .
 shows like x factor still absolutely use and abuse this though .
 what if the british version has emotional hooks ,  but they &apos;re too subtle for americans to notice ?
 german ones are just as bad .
 maybe even worse .
 haven’t seen enough of the american ones to say .
 german ones literally have returning actors haha .
 so you‘ll be watching „familien im brennpunkt“ which is about families who are having a tough time and there you‘ll get to know frida ,  family mother with anger issues .
 then right after „familien im brennpunkt“ ,  you might watch „die supernanny“ ,  a show about a supernanny raising troubled kids and there you‘ll get to know berta ,  family mother at her witts end ,  who is just frida‘s actress with a different haircolor .
 so yeah ,  german reality tv-shows actually have no right to be called that .
 atleast in the us kitchen nightmares gordon actually goes to actual restaurants .
 in german reality tv nothing is true .
 the people dont exist and the stories are made up .
 people find ways to justify their actions .
 it &apos;s a defense mechanism of sorts that protects them from reality .
 i imagine that &apos;s the only way torturers live with themselves .
 they &apos;re doing the right thing in their own twisted world-view .
 this particular method ,  the victim sits in a chair .
 a very long garrote wire is affixed to the wall behind them .
 gets wrapped around the victim’s neck .
 torturer/execution pulls on it .
 this is after substantial periods of beatings or other executions to extract information .
 the wire can be pulled slowly to extend the suffering .
 i watched the documentary a while ago ,  but as far as i can remember it was being strangled with thin wire so that it would sink into your neck ,  not allowing the victim to grab it .
 he killed hundreds and hundreds of people with this method .
 absolutely horrific ,  as is much of the documentary ,  but it’s a really important film and really worth watching .
 i don’t remember if it was the same moment of the doc ,  but one method he describes is laying a victim on their knees in front of a table and then pulling their neck from behind with a wire ,  choking them against the table with his foot up for extra leverage .
 steel wire wrapped around their necks .
 more efficient than bullets ,  he said .
 the book of job is far more hardcore than that ,  having a storm flatten his house and kill his children while falling ill from supernatural disease is a bit much .
 to quote  &apos;common people &apos; from pulp: .
  &apos;but still you &apos;ll never get it right   .
  &apos;cause when you &apos;re laid in bed at night   .
 watching roaches climb the wall   .
 if you called your dad he could stop it all ,  yeah &apos;
 their reaction is the real show .
 but then they whip out the clause in the contract that allows their assistant to edit any scene that shows them in a negative light .
 the problem would be that even if it was no problem ,  the ceo would still be pissed af because he has more important shit to do probably
 shaves off 15 years from your life expectancy in addition to the soul-crushing ,  too .
 yeah and they don’t actually have the same worries .
 imagine being sentenced to prison for a crime you didn’t commit .
 a day would be easy but a lifetime would be terrible .
 dont forget the countless insensitive comments theyll make throughout the show like  &apos;just pay your bills on time then !
 for only 400 dollars .
 it &apos;s a tent on wheels !
 you mean the office isn’t real ?
 watch ,  “alone” they teach the contestants to use the cameras and set up multiple shots .
 and even then ,  a kind of like truman show is illegal because you have to give consent to release the video .
 that &apos;s kinda what the first comment says too .
 like how can someone experience what it &apos;s like to be poor if they know it will end in a month and if something really bad happens they &apos;d just call the show/episode off .
 the show would just be quirky bs ,   &apos;oh no my car broke down so i need to take the bus &apos; or  &apos;oh no i have only ramen to eat (eats full meal off camera) &apos; .
 i &apos;d fuck up bezos 1v1 .
 his karate is no match .
 that &apos;s not quite right
 or sending the fat soft politicians out to get shot at as an infantry soldier in the next war they send our kids into .
 and there was when michael portillo became a single mother ,  that one was good ,  he grabbed that bottle of wine before realising it cost his entire food budget for the week ,  he did make a decent go of it though as i recall ,  but do they really remember what it was like when they &apos;re saying  &apos;we &apos;re all in this together &apos; while half the parents are pretending they &apos;re not hungry at least one night a week to make sure the kids eat ?
 there was a similar programme where ian duncan smith and 2 or 3 other politicians did swap with poor people .
 i think he may have been the only one that bailed .
 weapons grade cunt .
 this should be mandatory training for leaders though some still may not get it .
 well ,  yeah ,  the rich part of town is a terrible place to be homeless .
 everyone around you wants you out .
 it &apos;s much safer to be homeless in the poor parts of town ,  where the residents have sympathy because they know they &apos;re next .
 a scripted  &apos;reality &apos; show ?
 surely you jest .
 “what do they sell at walmart ?
 in my experience the people who actually made the money are often pretty good people .
 flawed ,  as we all are ,  but fundamentally decent .
 their kids though .
 exactly ,  this show is still airing new episodes .
 we on reddit just stopped watching .
 thank you for articulating so clearly what &apos;s wrong with that show .
 this sums it up for me too .
 once they get back to their executive salaries and lives do you think that was ever revisited ?
 my money says no .
 i had the same problem with “extreme makeover:home edition” .
 it’s all “princess for a day , ” with absolutely no questioning of whether there should be princesses or other royalty lording it over everyone else .
 and this is how it would work if they decided to do the show op proposed .
 there’s no way any of the major corporations ,  who control nearly every channel and network and are now getting into streaming ,  would give us a realistic portrayal .
 politics work this way now too .
  here &apos;s the legislation we just passed ,  here &apos;s one person that benefit greatly from it .
 (especially the corporate overlord ,  i mean sponsor of this bill)
 that &apos;s why i hate that show !
 i could never put it into words .
 lol still better than undercover boss canada .
  &apos;hey sharon we know you &apos;re struggling for paying for university for your daughter while taking care of your parents with dementia and your other daughter with autism ,  but we heard she loved cinderella so here &apos;s a weeklong trip to disneyworld &apos;
 that escape was provided by ford .
 which would make it effective propaganda .
 and it never had that epiphany moment ,  where the boss realizes it &apos;s nearly impossible to work yourself up from the bottom without lots of advantages .
  i think american entertainment is tightly controlled more than people realize .
  there &apos;s nothing shocking or status quo rocking anymore right ?
 when was the last time any media provoked a social movement .
 instead ,  media now is used to control the masses ,  it quells them .
 hard hitting stories are replaced by mild inconveniences .
 all media is paid by industry advertisers .
 no media is rocking that boat .
 industry doesn &apos;t want the status quo rocked .
  you &apos;d never have a show on western television that is provoking .
 that won &apos;t ever happen again .
 internet was the best chance but did you see how quick marketeers moved on it .
 look at youtube compared to 10 years ago .
 media is too strong to be left to it &apos;s on desires .
 instead it always has to be controlled because it &apos;s the most direct way of sending messages to the people .
 it can &apos;t ever be free .
 we would never get a show that challenges our current system because the people who would fund those shows are people who would lose wealth over it .
 don &apos;t forget to chuck in a handful of frozen/tinned veg ,  an egg and a bit of soy sauce to convince yourself that it &apos;s a proper meal
 yeah that &apos;s great until you &apos;ve been doing it for years and start feeling chest pains ,  roll into the er because you can &apos;t afford a doctor ,  and they tell you your blood pressure is dangerously high from years of cheap high sodium diets and if you don &apos;t change your lifestyle your heart will explode .
 shetler  water  food
  &apos;i don &apos;t have any money for rent big bro .
 also i &apos;m stuck in the washing machine ,  can you help me out ?
 it &apos;s not as good a source of protein as the internet makes it out to be .
 and after that ,  you &apos;ve still gotta show up to work and put on a happy face or get 3 different earfulls from your 3 different bosses .
 or tell them to go get a sick note
 and they can &apos;t just call it quits .
 failure means spending the rest of the three months on the streets .
 or that thing when you get 30 days notice your rent is going up 200% due to  &apos;market fluctuations &apos; from tech company expanding headquarters ,  so you need to find a new place and possibly a car (since you &apos;ll be outside of public transit bounds to afford rent) immediately .
  the last 4 years you all described my life perfectly .
 here &apos;s hoping my new job actually pays off well .
 don’t forget to throw in some student loan debt .
 well then we &apos;d just have to tow it outside of the environment .
 i was thinking more like ,  crashing on their couch or using there cars ,  but good point !
 intentional or not that pun is pretty sick tho
 or in a suburb in america with no public transport because  &apos;it &apos;ll bring those kinds of people here .
  &apos; by which our mayor meant poor people (who are already here) ,  drug addicts (again ,  here already) ,  gang members (again ,  here) and homeless people (yup .
 thanks for the silver ,  stranger !
 that &apos;s a fantastic way of determining which extras they get .
 you &apos;ve got a bright future as a reality tv producer .
 this is such a great idea .
 now i &apos;m wondering what kind of questions would be best to ask .
 aaaaaand congratulations you &apos;re fired !
 wanted ad: child ,  big asshole ,  to live with random billionaire .
 “ok ,  billy ,  all you have to do is act normal .
 imagine bezos working .
 that itself is almost punishment enough .
 the worry and stress ,  trying to pay the outrageous bills from christmas with a check 1/3 the size of the last few weeks ,  kids probably starting to get sick ,  etc .
 there &apos;s no rule they have to be exact calendar months .
  start mid-november like a week before thanksgiving ,  go to mid-february .
  you get black friday ,  the holiday season ,  post-holiday cut backs ,  and the worst of the winter weather all in one ,  plus heat bills to pay .
 that &apos;s the thing right there .
 some documentaries/reality shows have already been made with this idea in mind ,  in some fashion anyway .
 it &apos;s not inherently a bad idea ,  but it &apos;s negating too many variables that put the person there in the first place .
 the very notion that it &apos;s temporary ruins the entire study .
 only way to do it properly would be to somehow yank them out of their cushy lifestyle without their knowledge or consent and that &apos;s wildly unethical .
 yeah the true despair of being poor is that you really can &apos;t see any way out .
 or the effects of having lived a lower quality of life until then .
 a pampered healthy body and few or even no mental health issues will make them last a bit longer .
 i &apos;m not sure if that example specifically refers to a real person; it &apos;s almost completely plausible and i was more or less on board until the very specific detail of the four month-long medically induced coma he was put under while the doctors had to  &apos;find a replacement for his dick that got cut off .
  &apos; it &apos;s fucking hilarious though and was my first  &apos;laugh alone at my desk like a lunatic &apos; moment of the day .
 fortunately ,  there are lots of good car shows on youtube .
 tavarish ,  hoovies garage ,  wrech every day and watchjrgo are all really enjoyable to watch ,  if you like shows about buying and  tinkering on rare/old/exotic or just plain weird cars .
 for car reviews ,  i like raitis rides and straight pipes .
 for auto auctions ,  yourcarbro looks at and buys a lot of cool ,  ultra rare jdm cars at japanese auctions .
 one of those baking shows ,  i think it was cake boss ,  does that .
 they made this huge cake and then had to move it down a flight of stairs to the van .
 of course ,  it fell and was destroyed .
 it goes to commercial with everyone giving each other the  &apos;oh shit oh fuck &apos; look .
 comes back from commercial ,   &apos;good thing we have an identical backup cake !
 are you fucking serious .
 oh ,  i saw this episode !
 yeah ,  but the show he does in the uk is apparently run by a camera man with adhd and a zoom fetish .
 the show can &apos;t go for more then six seconds without a zoom cut to a quarter inch from gordon &apos;s hands .
 half the time i can &apos;t understand what he &apos;s cooking from the visuals because all i see is a knife cutting some red vegetable .
 is that a beet ?
 fuck if i know ,  i can see the damn thing &apos;s genetic code and atomic structure ,  but not the damn shape its zoomed in so much .
 then after the break someone drops a plate and that &apos;s it
 fuck that &apos;s accurate .
 right ,  because they had to make him relatable to us angry americans .
 it fuckin pisses me off that they did that !
 yeah there were so egotistical chefs in the uk one who you could tell were legit .
 the staff were cringing around them before the argument came .
 i pretty much knew from  &apos;hi ,  i &apos;m matt .
 that sketch is more accurate than the actual show .
 i can &apos;t have a family anymore cause my dick got chopped off in the accident .
  the first 2 seasons maybe .
  but after this many seasons you got to know what &apos;s up when an older new person shows up with a camera crew .
  it &apos;s gotta be fairly obvious at this point .
 what sort of show did they say ?
 just curious ,  as i always think if a camera crew are following a rookie for a non exciting job ,  i &apos;d think it &apos;s probably undercover boss .
 also some of the disguises are hilarious and pretty obvious
 just give me a raise .
 i ain &apos;t asking for no kind of scholarships or nothing .
 after the rain comes the rainbow .
 sorry i killed your son .
 i learned a lot today ,  i think people are going to love the new me .
 the other day a guy wanted to buy new refrigeration for his restaurant .
 my husband and i were pleasantly surprised by sure a mundane but nice reason to want the money .
 usually it’s sad or it’s “my kids have never been on vacation so .
 ” which is sweet but still playing up emotions for tv .
 the top model is really bad for this one .
 example: girl walks in looking completely normal ,  then tyra  says: .
  &apos;wow your eyes are looking sad ,  what &apos;s going on ?
 sad  music plays  .
  &apos;i was molested as a child &apos; .
 does anyone actually still watch that show ?
 they have emotional hooks but it &apos;s vastly less dramatic because we don &apos;t expect them to be there .
 we expect the hooks to more be in what &apos;s not said and to be in the background .
 for instance ,  one of the later series of great british bake off has a woman with a congenital hand issue ,  and one of my happiest moments was realising they were never going to mention it ,  draw attention to it ,  anything .
 it was just a thing in the background that was true but not an issue .
 an american show would never have done that - they &apos;d have forced it to be a big deal and forced this poor lass to talk about how haaard it was etc .
 nah ,  she just got on with shit because being able-bodied or disabled is kind of irrelevant ,  we &apos;re here to find a good baker not a good sob story .
 the emotional hook is that you get invested in your favourite characters and want them to do well ,  but also love that they all support each other and care about each other doing well .
 you don &apos;t need to force it with manipulating character backstories .
 now that netflix run it ,  you can see that the american influence is bleeding in and a lot of people don &apos;t like it .
 most of my fellow americans need to be beaten over the head with a plot device to notice it .
 i think many people would be surprised how much this can occur too .
 like nazi germany ,  they fully believed they were helping their country and doing the right thing .
 my dad used to torture people when he was in special forces ,  he drinks heavily just to be able to sleep at night .
 i once asked him if he thought the information he got saved lives ,  he just said maybe five or ten ,  it wasn’t worth it .
 he’s a jingoistic jerk most of the time ,  but occasionally that mask falls and he just breaks down .
 he defends torture as a method of getting information in public but will break down and admit it was monstrous in private .
 i think it’s all saving face .
 the last execution by garrote was in spain in 1974 .
 i have a reasonable morbid curiosity ,  but i did not need to read that .
 unless you make the rules so extreme that no billionaire would ever agree with it .
 kill off literally their entire family .
 it &apos;s ok though at the end they get a new one .
 not the old family back ,  just a new one .
 honestly ,  i &apos;m partial to the bizarre william shatner version of the song .
 insert intense zoom shots at their face at 50° angle and boom background music
 true ,  so the film goes unproduced ,  however the entertainment ,  comedy ,  and scandals roll over to a script ,  or actors for an snl skit or something .
 they are out there .
 you &apos;d make them do a year ?
  &apos;why dont presidents fight the war ?
 why do they always send the poor ?
 look what homeless gave me ,  mother .
 here &apos;s some money ,  go see a star war
 yeah but they are the rich so theys get to see how shit they really are
 honestly though i’ve seen it both ways .
 my best friend is unbelievably wealthy and yes ,  she has her sheltered moments but she’s so fucking sweet and generous .
 one of the coolest people i’ve ever met in my life .
 in college i also met a guy at a party in his parents’ $20+ million house and he was insanely nice and humble too .
 just a reminder that you can be a bit spoiled and still be a really good person .
 i hate to see people completely discounted because of their family wealth instead of being judged on their character .
 i just found it interesting that everyone was talking about it in past tense even though it still airs .
 i watched it with my mom while i was visiting her .
 you never know if the next new hire is actually the boss ,  so don’t be slipping up .
 we’re watching you from all angles
  &apos;man that experience sure taught me to appreciate what i have !
 thanks for the perspective ,  poor people !
 plus now the people that own the home owe more taxes from the improvements done to their home .
 yeah ,  the problem is that the ceo &apos;s and companies signing up for this are those who know they will come out looking like angels .
 they roasted an employer of a rental car dealership in france a couple of weeks ago because she gave this employee doing the job above and beyond a weekend at disneyland but give a younger guy who ignored her during lunch to watch harry potter on his phone a management training session so he could move up in the company .
 that twitter feed was hilarious as they flailed around with excuses  .
 there would also be a market for a show that flays predatory lenders and student loan officers .
 but now i &apos;m being redundant .
 and triple the cost ?
 its about efficiency !
 old habits die hard lol ,  that was my staple when i was in grad school making 20k a year .
 that and a bag of day old bagels at the start of the week for $3 with peanut butter .
 i still do that .
 tesco near me have a huge haul of out of date bread twice a week ,  so this dude comes by in his estate car and fills up so he can use it to feed his pigs .
 i &apos;ve had loaves from him so i could crumble it for breadcrumbs for stuffing ,  coatings for scotch eggs etc .
 got to say my best haul as a student was when they were throwing out bags of flour because they had surpassed their  &apos;use by &apos; date .
 how in the hell do they let that happen ?
 flour lasts for like 8 months .
 till you get sick from the bleach these places dump all over it .
 seriously ,  in the us all that food that couldn &apos;t be sold just gets tossed ,  and then bleached so you cant eat from the dumpster .
 ive literally walked off a job when i refused to dump chems all over perfectly good food and they said i had to .
 no point in paying utilities or buying stuff if you get evicted .
 this comment reminds me that i only have like ,  6 more decades until i finally die .
 this shit hits home .
 and you can &apos;t even vent to your co-worker about anything because your co-worker is an undercover boss who is filming it and will call you out and fire you in front of millions of viewers for being a negative nancy .
 but they &apos;re saying the closest hospital is  &apos;out of network ?
 i had to wait 6 hours !
 and theyre constantly at risk of being fired .
 no special treatment whatsoever .
 hey ,  just want to get a better idea on things .
 i’m asian and most ppl that i know stays with their parents until late 20s ,  possibly even late 30s unless they are married .
 too often have i heard of “the west” wanting “freedom” and how the young adults will quickly seek out a job and an apartment of their own ( rental ) asap .
 is this really the culture there ?
 for me ,  i don’t mind staying with my parents while slowly taking over the expenses .
 it’s a smoother curve with tons of fallbacks / experiences to rely on as compared to just venturing outwards by myself .
 one of the justification i can think of now is this .
 perhaps , their family are so messed up that the kids rather take up loans than to deal with them but it seems too extreme to thinking of everyone as having a fucked up family .
 that breaks like every lease law in the universe .
  if you have a lease ,  it can &apos;t change until it ends or the parties voluntarily agree to modify it ,  or a court orders it invalid .
  i would definitely sue .
 unless you &apos;re month to month ,  then you &apos;re fucked ,  because you basically have a new lease every 30 days .
 well then ,  good luck man .
 hope you get lucky
 into another environment ?
 more like sleep in their guest house .
 you &apos;re over your shitty low coverage for the year and now your health bill is out of pocket
 same reason rich ppl say they don &apos;t want m4a by saying  &apos;i want a choice !
  &apos; yeah really you want the choice of a doctor that poor ppl don &apos;t have access to
 was in australia and a distant relative told me how great it was to live in their area north of sydney as there was no train line so less immigrants .
 i think she must &apos;ve forgotten that she &apos;s one .
 how much could a banana cost ?
 imagine bezos pissing in a bottle to meet his quota ,  then being fired because a robot doesn &apos;t piss .
 our usual bet mortimer ?
 only way to do it properly would be to somehow yank them out of their cushy lifestyle without their knowledge or consent and that &apos;s wildly unethical .
 and if you &apos;re into the fixin up classics side ,  there &apos;s a whole set of guys like junkyard digs ,  thunderhead289 ,  dylan mccool ,  vicegrip garage ,  deboss garage ,  zipties and bias plies ,  flying sparks garage ,  thecraig909 ,  gibson63 .
 and for newer stuff there &apos;s samcrac ,  alex rebuilds ,  rich rebuilds ,  eric the car guy ,  chrisfix .
 so many options you could start a new powernation channel .
 eleven times ,  in fact .
  &apos;i can see it &apos;s genetic code and atomic structure &apos; .
 thanks for the laugh
 this was a big complaint about his show “the f word” too .
  it still gets blown apart over it on youtube to this day
 not to make him more relatable ,  just that they knew him getting mad was the biggest draw and so turned it up to the max .
 my dick got chopped up tho
 tell him about my chopped up dick .
 sure ,  which is why the entire process leading up you &apos;re in contact with a producer assigned to you ,  and you &apos;re fully aware it &apos;s for a tv show .
 you just think it &apos;s a totally different type of show .
 they have fake badges and all the paperwork has the name of the fake show on it .
 you &apos;re fully aware that you &apos;re going to be on tv ,  they just tell you it &apos;s for something else .
 they told us they were filming for a reality competition ,  and one of the challenges was to drop the contestant into a real-world business to see how they do with particular tasks .
 after they filmed with us ,  we were supposed to get together with  &apos;celebrity judges &apos; to evaluate their performance
 i think i did pretty well .
 i met 4 friends and only killed one .
 the uk shows tend to have much lower prize money amounts ,  1 , 000-2 , 000 pound .
 when you ask people what they &apos;ll do with the money ,  they basically say  &apos;oh we kinda want a kitchen remodel &apos; or  &apos;we &apos;ll go on a nice cruise and bring the grandparents so they can see our kids &apos; or occasionally  &apos;i was planning on using it as the down-payment for a new flat &apos; .
 fairly real-people things to use money for ,  far less sob-story bullshit .
 i think i didn &apos;t even notice until the fourth episode .
 a lot of herd mentality and propaganda and gradually acclimatizing the masses to more and more extreme positions as well .
 humans are extremely durable at times ,  and at other times extremely fragile and fallible (mentally) .
 it &apos;s easy for some to take advantage of that .
 they didn &apos;t just think they were helping germany .
 they thought they were saving human cilivazation .
 countries rise and fall all the time .
 one more is only so much .
 but what would someone be willing to do to save humanity as a whole ?
 we can see what they &apos;re willing to do .
 that &apos;s quite harrowing ,  thanks for sharing .
 will the show include 6 episodes of them arguing moral philosophy with god ?
 otherwise we are just sacrificing accuracy
 and the paperwork they sign has to make sure to state that they can &apos;t get financial support from outside sources .
 i know a photo of jk simmons in sunglasses when i see one .
 and that stupid fucking  &apos;power vest &apos; is all over seattle .
 i know it &apos;s a soad lyric ,  but most presidents do have military experience .
 the last 2 haven &apos;t (dubya is debatable) ,  but a good like ,  3/4 have .
 but also i do think military experience should be a requirement for presidency ,  given that they &apos;re literally commander in chief of the armed forces .
 you depend on our protection yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth
 you’re not technically wrong ,  but have you ever looked at banana prices ?
 they’re obscenely cheap .
 like less than a quarter cheap .
 bananas will cost $10 when a ford focus costs over half a million .
 not in our lifetime .
 yeah truth is that people are people and whilst their environment may make them more likely to be a certain way ,  it’s in no way guaranteed
 people tend to point at money as the culprit ,  but i think it has more to do with environment .
 you can see the same entitled and spoiled nature from the top rungs of society all the way down to the bottom .
 i &apos;m not sure about relative frequencies ,  but i do know they exist .
 i think parenting plays a big role .
 if you &apos;re raised with a silver spoon ,  everyone starts to look like a servant .
 kind of like the hammer and nails problem .
  the new guy has a whole ass camera crew following him around !
 srsly ,  that shit was soooo phony !
  of course they knew who he was !
 it &apos;s the same with the show cops .
 that show has been used almost exclusively to repair the reputations of police departments embroiled in controversy .
 at least add the egg .
 eggs are cheap af .
 you can get a dozen for like $1 .
 25 which comes out to about 10 cents each .
 we had instant ramen with frozen veggies and an egg last night .
 no matter how much we make ,  it will always be one of my favourite meals .
 this comment reminded me of how excited i am for my natural retirement
 with the right choices you can cut that down to 3 decades tops .
 smoke as many cigarettes as you can fit in your mouth ,  acquire a habit for downing bottles of absinthe ,  and shelf a fuckload of pingers .
 repeat the process twice weekly for best results .
  the ulitimate undercover at a sepeeate compamy .
  they get fired the lose thier job .
  they lose their company !
 and they’re verbally harassed at work .
 it’s practically legal .
 there is generally a stigma against living with your parents past a certain age but i agree it should be an option if you need it and your parents aren &apos;t destitute or trying to helicopter you or anything .
 my parents were toxic and i needed to get out for my own sanity .
 probably not the case for every young adult ,  but there are enough of us .
 but yes ,  it’s definitely like that here in the usa .
 a young adult/twenty-something who “still lives with his parents” is seen as something undesirable ,  someone you wouldn’t want to date .
 “ugh ,  but he still lives with his parents .
 ” or a common internet insult is ,  “i know you’re typing this bs from your parents’ basement” (the implication being that the person is a troll/loser .
 i had a friend who used to teach english in china .
 when it came time to teach the phrase ,  “by myself” ,  she used the example of ,  “after college i moved out of my parents’ house and lived by myself .
 ” she had such a hard time teaching that because her students were truly dumbfounded by the idea that you would move out like that .
 i can’t speak for everyone but i know a lot of teens like me start looking to move asap because we have shitty parents that we don’t want to or can’t deal with anymore .
 honestly i’d live anywhere that’s not here at this point .
 the reason that perception exists is that the economy and job markets in the us did facilitate early independence -- for white families ,  anyway -- until a generation of boomers made everything more expensive ,   required more education for jobs they just walked into ,  cut taxes on the rich ,  and dissolved most of the social safety net that had been in place since the great depression .
 now those people think we &apos;re lazy and stupid because we can &apos;t walk into a career at 19 that buys a house ,  a car ,  two vacations a year and 2 .
 there a lot of reasons but one is that a person that is still living with their parents are typically viewed as lazy .
 they aren &apos;t seen as taking care of their elders but rather using them to avoid responsibility .
 in reality ,  it &apos;s a 60 day renewal notice letting you know rent is going up 34 .
 9% because regional statutes dictate annual increases 35% or over are a violation .
 while working full time and managing a family of 3 on a slightly higher than minimum wage ,  you spend any free time taking the bus from apartment to apartment trying to find a complex that has a 2 bedroom for less than $2500 a month ,  and which will be available in 2 months .
 they &apos;re all too expensive or they won &apos;t know what &apos;s available until current tenants get their renewal notices in ,  and that &apos;s only a 30 day requirement .
 unsuccessful with city housing options ,  you find rent similar to what you &apos;ve been used to ,  but it &apos;s outside of public transit and you &apos;ll have to move your kids schools in the middle of the year .
 and maybe get a car ?
 as tech company headquarters continues to expand ,  will rent rates increase in the suburbs too ?
 find out next time .
  got lucky recently with a free college course and apprenticeship so hopefully .
 no ,  it &apos;s been towed beyond the environment .
 what you’re $7500 in the hole from a hospital bill and you haven’t hit your $15 , 000 deductible ?
 those are rookie numbers !
 even then ,  this is a bogus argument .
 we already don’t have choice - you pick a doctor in your network .
 insurance companies already dictate the pool of doctors you can choose from .
 don &apos;t get me started on that shit .
 right now ,  we have excellent healthcare through my husband &apos;s employer and i am so grateful .
 i can finally get the antianxiety/antidepressant that works best for me instead of having to make do with one that doesn &apos;t work so great .
 i can afford to actually see a doctor about the chronic pain i &apos;ve lived with for half my life (turns out i have ra ,  fibro and possibly atypical psoriatic arthritis--bloodwork hasn &apos;t come back on that yet) and do something about it .
 i had horrible horrible sciatica pain that i was able to go to the doctor about instead of being in so much pain i could barely walk .
 we are not poor .
 i consider us poor-adjacent ,  tbh .
 i think technically we &apos;re  &apos;middle class &apos; but just barely .
 but i grew up poor as fucking dirt and i know how hard the poor have it .
 how shitty the healthcare was .
 how shitty it still is because my mom has to rely on medicare for her healthcare now and she can barely afford to see a doctor for her 84 , 000 health problems .
 health problems which started when she was in her mid 40s (i &apos;m 41 now) which scare the living shit out of me .
 imagine the robot pissing on bezos because it needed to assert dominance .
 i was just making a joke ,  please let me have this .
 it &apos;s all i may ever have .
 straight meat gristle .
 the point he is making is not that you know you are on tv ,  but what  &apos;other show &apos; (the fake one) is going to be centered around the camera crew following a brand new employee starting at the lowest level that is 40+ ?
 even if you don &apos;t know 100% that it is undercover boss ,  you have your suspicions and so you are going to act as if it was .
 i &apos;m currently a billionaire ceo living a life of luxury .
 where do i sign up ?
 he &apos;s here to pump iron and give his workers basic rights and dignity .
 and he &apos;s all out of basic rights and dignity .
 jfk was an actual hero .
  his dad tried to get him a cushy out if the way post but he still wound up in action and when his ship was sunk he swam back to saved as many of his crew as he could
 i always figured they meant it as what you said last .
 the people giving the orders should be at the front of their decisions ,  not detatched and unaffected .
 i thought they were mostly officers though ,  not enlisted .
 theres a big difference there .
 most people agree .
 that &apos;s why having military experience usually helps a candidate
 iirc there was always a cover story like they were filming some new training videos or something .
 it &apos;s not like this new employee just randomly shows up with a camera crew .
 not to that that makes the show any better ,  but still .
 that &apos;s literally doubling the cost of the meal
 do you fry the egg or hard boil it ?
 what &apos;s the preferred cooking method ?
 asking for a friend as i &apos;m totally rich right now .
 thanks for that .
 when i was homeless for a while ,  the best day was the day that suddenly word went around the camp that someone had dropped off a huge haul of onion buns .
 i still get nostalgic when i have an onion buns ,  more than a decade later .
 we live in a wild time ,  methinks .
  i &apos;m fairly old (7th decade) ,  so i remember back to the early 1960s ,  and certain common things then ,  which today are either unheard of ,  or even you &apos;ve-got-to-be-kidding in nature .
 cracker barrels (thin ,  oak ,  with hinged lids ,  30 gallon)  .
 of all sorts of things .
  spaghetti (in the much nicer 18 inch length) .
 rice ,  bulgar ,  barley ,  cornmeal .
  weevils were always an issue ,  tho &apos; .
 no dates on any packaging .
  instead of the nanny-state trying to ensure product  &apos;safety &apos; (which is just an excuse to toss stuff which is perfectly good ,  turning over stock and corporate profits) ,  it was  &apos;buyer-be-conscious-of-what &apos;s-good &apos; .
 no plastic film ,  period .
  the meat counter had butchers ,  who cut-and-packaged your purchases personally .
  in pink glazed paper .
  and your fish in newspaper .
  and your vegetables in little brown paper bags with handles .
  and your groceries in really strong paper bags .
 sodas in glass bottles ,  or steel cans .
  mostly endlessly reused glass ,  for the common brands ,  steel cans for the odd stuff .
 there weren &apos;t aisles and aisles of cleaning products ,  or sugary snacks ,  or snacking-chips ,  or individually wrapped anythings .
  we were happy -- as kids -- with milk and graham crackers !
  and not-instant-cooking oatmeal topped with butter and brown sugar .
 there might &apos;ve only been 2 or 3 brands of ice cream .
 same for packaged breakfast cereals ,   &apos;pasta sauces &apos; .
 there were a lot of canned vegetables tho &apos;: vast swaths of our nation really didn &apos;t have veggies in winter .
  or sizeable markets that &apos;d try to stock them .
 life is different now .
 with global climate change ,  and our utter societal addiction to hyper-ubiquitous product distribution and truck-oriented transportation ,  whether all the talk about doing good is rendered moot by just-how-far we &apos;ve deviated form the 1960s  &apos;mostly-let &apos;s-reuse-it &apos; mantra .
 at this point it &apos;s my only retirement option
 crystal meth will really accelerate things .
 and shelf a fuckload of pingers .
 wtf does this mean
 and every episode ,  they have to spend at least 45 minutes (we see a condensed version) reading internet comments telling them all about boot straps ,  and getting a real job .
 i just started my first job and my aim is to slowly take over payment for .
 learn to do the taxes ,  pay the bills ,  what to do if things break etc .
 if i mess up anything ,  at least i can still refer to my parents ( for now ) .
 end goal would be to learn how to learn .
 i feel that mine never equipped me for the real world and kicked me out at 18 .
 homeless for awhile now  i am living comfortable on that food stamp/ gov housing .
 make 800$ a month working 15 hours a week ,  and go to college full time .
 literally live relatively comfortable ,  but they cant afford to let me live at home on their 85k/yr combined salaries .
 2+ yrs and i got that bachelors in chemical engineering .
 my daughter is only 2 right now ,  but i &apos;m determined to have a place for her in my home for the entirety of my life .
 if she choses to stay ,  that &apos;s entirely on her but i will never deny her a home .
 few months before i graduated my dad told me he was moving across the country with his girlfriend of under a year and it was strongly implied that i wasn’t welcome (he only offered painfully when his girlfriend was there because she was actually a pretty nice lady) .
 actually the first time he visited arizona was right after i got a concussion and he dropped me off at my sisters so he could fuck off and have his fun weekend
 i don’t even think i can afford kids .
 i can probably raise up a few kids but they won’t have the optimal education package to make them truly truly shine .
 kids are expensive mann .
 yeah ,  but from one environment to another environment .
 it was a great joke .
 good thing we live in such enlightened times .
 that could never happen now .
 message me im on minimum wage barely making it .
 you had me in the first half there ,  not gonna lie .
 like seinfeld ,  he &apos;s so rich that he has nothing better to do .
 kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members to vote on whether to  &apos;fight or surrender &apos; .
 kennedy stated:  &apos;there &apos;s nothing in the book about a situation like this .
 a lot of you men have families and some of you have children .
 what do you want to do ?
 i have nothing to lose .
  &apos; shunning surrender ,  around 2:00 p .
 on august 2 ,  the men swam towards plum pudding island 3 .
 6 km) southwest of the remains of pt-109 .
 3344 despite re-injuring his back in the collision ,  kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth .
 45 kennedy made an additional two-mile swim the night of august 2 ,  1943 ,  to ferguson passage to attempt to hail a passing american pt boat to expedite his crew &apos;s rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night ,  in a damaged canoe found on naru island where he had swum with ensign george ross to look for food .
 on august 4 ,  1943 ,  he and lenny thom assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim 3 .
 04 km) southeast to olasana island ,  which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on plum pudding island .
 they swam against a strong current ,  and once again kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist  &apos;pappy &apos; macmahon by his life vest .
 the somewhat larger olasana island had ripe coconut trees ,  but still no fresh water .
 47 on the following day ,  august 5 ,  kennedy and ensign george ross made the one hour swim to naru island ,  an additional distance of about  .
 80 km) southwest ,  in search of help and food .
 kennedy and ross found a small canoe ,  packages of crackers ,  candy and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the japanese ,  which kennedy paddled another half mile back to olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew .
 lieutenant  &apos;bud &apos; liebenow ,  a friend and former tentmate of kennedy &apos;s ,  rescued kennedy and his crew on olasana island on august 8 ,  1943 aboard his boat ,  pt-157 ,  with the help of coast watcher lieutenant reginald evans and several native coast watchers ,  particularly biuku gasa and eroni kumana .
 mckinley ,  buchanan ,  lincoln .
 but i &apos;m not sure why there &apos;s a big difference .
 a number of them that weren &apos;t enlisted men and were in the officer corps still saw combat and still got their asses shot up/shot at .
 there &apos;s a bar here in são paulo that has bunches of bananas hanging on the wall and you can just help yourself .
 bananas don &apos;t go well with beer ,  however .
 and if you watch the show people realize what &apos;s going on all the time and call them out .
 people who worked for these companies had to know something was up .
 i mean i know how effing cheap my huge corporation is .
 there &apos;s no way they &apos;d hire a professional camera crew to film any sort of video on our property .
 hr would just follow us around with their cell phone and take a few shots .
 but somehow these rinky dink operations with like 10 employees can afford a whole entire camera professional crew to follow around a trainee ?
 it’s also the only part of the meal keeping you alive ,  so if anything skip the ramen and down the egg .
 but it’s quintupling the nutritional value .
 i imagine bad things would happen after a month with no protein  .
 just drop it in with the noodles while the water is hot and stir .
 best way imo is to cook the noodles and whip the egg up separately with the oil and flavour sachet .
 once the noodles are done ,  drain them and pour them into the egg/flavour mix ,  stir it together well then fry it up in a buttered frying pan until its nice and crispy .
 also remember to flip it so it is nice and crispy on both sides .
 i use indomie mie goreng ramen because it is fucking unreal .
 you can also add cheese to make it even better if you &apos;ve just been paid .
 just tell your personal chef to make it “peasant style”
 my retirement will probably involve me going to prison or something ,  since i barely have anything else to pull from
 i make very little .
 i have been making below the federal poverty line and paying 11% of my income into a “defined benefits plan” for 7 years .
 the good part is my employer matches that 11% .
 the bad part is the plan is starting to sink .
 i will be vested at my 8 year mark .
 mandatory 11% of my poverty wages and there probably won’t be anything left when i retire in 30 years .
 i spent a lot of time shopping for retirement options .
 by that i mean i spent a lot of time online researching which hollowpoints cause the most tissue damage with the smallest impact .
 in more ways than one .
 rectal application of mdma .
 two knuckles up the rectum and to the left is a little shelf to rest you xtc on and receive 10 time the hi
 it means /r/straya is leaking .
 i &apos;d also like to see them apply to other jobs with the resume of one of those employees .
 with the hope that you &apos;re parents have good money management skills to teach you .
 is this all true down the class ladder in your country ?
 or does living at home only apply to a certain class of people ?
 i grew up below the poverty line and dont want to do that to a kid .
 whatever i have i &apos;ll just leave to whichever of my friends kids i like best .
 totally forgoing kids this time around .
 i’m forty years old and just recently could afford my first apartment without roommates .
 also just got health insurance for the first time .
 but i work 70 hrs a week to afford it .
 i don’t think it will last much longer than my lease .
 of course ,  it could have been much worse .
 could have been made out of cardboard or cardboard derivatives .
 it &apos;s like scared straight: after the first season or two all the kids knew nothing would really happen to them .
 didn &apos;t stop the guards and inmates from trying ,  though .
 wouldn &apos;t most people also have at least seen the boss at some point before ?
 i don &apos;t get how that would work .
 nah ,  you need the calories to keep you moving and the excessive sodium to replenish all the salt lost through your nightly tears as you wonder how long you can keep going like this .
  when i had only a couple bucks to buy food for a week or two i’d always just buy the biggest carton of eggs i could afford .
 more nutritious and more filling than ramen .
 could get around a dozen and a half eggs for a couple bucks .
 american dollar vs .
 canadian dollar is what i &apos;m assuming .
 or ,  what &apos;s more likely is that when certain foods are brought to canada they instantly cost more money than the states because the producer is going to sell less in canada than the states due to the size population between the two .
 so to make up the cost of shipping/selling in canada ,  they jack the price up .
 it only gets worse the farther north you go .
 gotta get healthcare somehow .
 we call that boofing around here .
 i learn so much reading comments on here 
 give them three lifelines ,  like on who wants to be a millionaire ,  only the lifelines are buried under red-tape ,  and cannot be used in the case of pre-existing conditions .
 but our cars are very safe ,  brian ,  i want to make that quite clear .
 what if jod was one of us ?
 a large chunk of my taking the lord &apos;s name in vain would go away .
 do you want a holy war ?
 because that &apos;s how you get a holy war .
 he would also say ,  “my name isn’t god” then he would pronounce his name and everyone’s faces would melt .
 we’d be like ,  “no way !
 ” and he’d be like ,  “yahweh .
 holy shit ,  y’all are making my day
 i would be converted .
 thanks for the upvotes and awards guys !
 what if satan came down one day and said  &apos; &apos;it &apos;s pronounced  &apos;zlatan &apos; then left ?
 “i recognize the council has made a decision ,  but given that it’s a stupid-ass decision ,  i’ve elected to ignore it .
 then all of scandinavia will pronounce it like  &apos;yod &apos; and the spanish will pronounce it like  &apos;hod &apos;
 you &apos;d have different religious factions arguing that they &apos;re right and the other is wrong .
 does that mean jesus would be pronounced geezus ?
 it’s been 7 years since the creator of gifs confirmed the correct pronunciation of the word .
 this just proves that nobody on the internet has forgiven him .
 “they are illusions michael !
 a trick is something a whore does for money”
 graphic omnipotent deity .
 no ,  that &apos;s a hard g ,  bud .
 all the “jif” people would be really happy
 then we can be divisive on a whole slew of new things !
 was that really god ?
 who made god leave again ?
 i bet it was the liberals !
 they drove god away !
 jod was talking to me in particular !
  only i may refer to him as such !
 we have to murder anyone who dare says it with a hard  &apos;g &apos; !
 “i respect all religions equally” .
 earlier that day .
 “i don’t care for jod”
 jesus is actually pronounced yeshua .
 i doubt he would care .
 god isn &apos;t really a name though .
 100% would still pronounce it gif ,  not jif .
 heh jokes on you .
 here we call him allah .
 get back here and answer for children with cancer ,  you motherfucker !
 well i &apos;d have to think he &apos;s just trolling because god actually isn &apos;t even his name .
 his name is yhwh ,  god is just what people called him when they didn &apos;t want to use his actually name and after a while it just became the only thing people called him .
 christians ,  jews ,  and muslims only believe in one god so calling their god  &apos;god &apos; never had the problem of becoming confusing .
 though i know certain sect of christians call him jehovah ,  which seems to be an anglicized version of yhwh .
 and also allah is just arabic for god ,  it &apos;s not another name for him .
 it &apos;s like the equivalent of christians saying deus ,  the only difference is latin has lost it &apos;s value as the christian/western world &apos;s lingua franca .
 would satan make an announcement that it’s pronounced sah-tin instead of say-tin
 i would be like  &apos;didn &apos;t see that coming &apos;
 become a heretic .
 i refuse to pronounce it “jod”
 why would yhwh be speaking english or care what the english word for god is ?
  that’s not his name ,  it’s just our word for entities like him .
 kneel before jod ?
 in that case praise geezus
 oh my jod we messed up
 god is just a title to signify his level of power ,  his proper name is different depending on how you believe .
 jehovah ,  yahweh ,  allah ,  zarathustra ,  etc .
 people &apos;s names are their own ,  and the owner of the name is the exclusive authority on its pronunciation .
 anyone who doesn &apos;t listen to someone when they inform how to pronounce their name is an asshole .
 ‘geez guys no wonder i didn’t answer your prayers’
 just a nob like one of us .
 just a stranger on a bus .
 jod knows what was in your heart when you said it .
 only a large chunk ?
 did you have some inside info on this jod thing and start using it before his announcement ?
 depends on the interpretation .
 some take  &apos;taking his name in vain &apos; to mean something like  &apos;don &apos;t invoke god just for personal gain; yes ,  i &apos;m talking to you ,  pastor three-jets .
 the punishment due ?
 marty friedman intensifies

 #you &apos;re talking shit to someone in holy war distance
 e: i realize this isn’t the definition ,  but i’m keeping it anyway .
 dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnnnn
 i &apos;ll research how to summon a servant .
 his name is (at least approximately) yahweh .
 calm down ,  alanis .
 prepare your face ,  the abrahamic god &apos;s name is jehova or arguably yaweh
 take my upvote and go yahweh .
 lock the thread ,  this is about as good as it &apos;s going to get .
 a lot of people are focusing on the pronunciation part ,  while overlooking that it would confirm god exists .
 multiple people replying saying that it would confirm  &apos;jod &apos; exists .
  no it wouldn &apos;t .
  it would still be spelled god ,  just pronounced differently than we thought .
 zlatan means golden in some languages
 ibrahimovic is looking very sus over there
 zlatan:  &apos;only god knows who will go through .
 reporter:  &apos;it &apos;s hard to ask him .
 zlatan:  &apos;you &apos;re talking to him .

 then the football player would make more sense .
 i just had a brainfart ,  i know this was a samuel l jackson line ,  but i just spent 10 minutes trying to figure out when mace windu says this ,  isn &apos;t he influential in the council ?
 it &apos;s nick fucking fury fml
 the jod formerly known as god .
 i understood that reference
 this then pisses some people off because jod is also how you pronounce dirt .
 at least it would fix the french problem .
 the proper term for a dildo is  &apos;godemichet &apos; which is often shortened to  &apos;god &apos; .
 (of course dildo is widely used too ,  probably more than god depending on region and age .
 before someone references it ,  yeah yeah that scene in the exorcist
 in spain they would be start calling him: dioz .
 i mean ,  op said god came down and said it &apos;s pronounced jod not spelled jod
 what about atheists and agnostics ,  would they pick a side or start a new religion ?
 or maybe they’d deny the event even happened .
 the next great schism will be caused by a gif/jif style argument ,  that figures
 we already pronounce jesus as geezus .
 he would just come back and say it &apos;s jess-us
 the ultimate geezer
 why you keep calling me jesus ,  i look puerto rican to you ?
 i &apos;ve come across a version of the bible entitled  &apos;de nyew testament .
  &apos; it &apos;s the new testament written in gullah phonetically .
 within this text jesus is spelled/pronounced as jedus .
 i was going to go with  &apos;my jod ,  he &apos;s right !
 but yours is better .
  better by far ,  joddamit .
 the “gif” argument would be over
 i cannot remember which one the creator says it is .
 was it a hard or soft g ?
 the makers of jif peanut butter should weigh in that their product is pronounced with a hard g just to fuck with people .
 i don &apos;t give a fuck what that dude says .
 for at least 3 reasons: 1 .
 graphics interchange format ,  obviously the g in graphics is a hard g .
 why would gif and jif be pronounced the same ?
 the word gift ,  removing the t wouldn &apos;t change the pronunciation of the g .
 i don’t care for jod
 i scrolled down way too far to find the arrested development reference !
 it was the first thing i thought of .
  &apos;you &apos;re sinning against a deity in a $6 , 000 suit ,  i mean come on !
 he &apos;s ready to  &apos;let the son of jod enfold me .
 no no ,  its  &apos;geoff on demand &apos; .
 giraffeical omnipotent deity .
 jod has a long neck
 no its geo omnipotent deity .
 so a hard j ,  pal .
 that gif argument always bugs me .
 acronyms don’t keep the pronunciation of their words .
 it’s not “scuhb-aa .
 yeah ,  this thread was a long way to go for the gif battle .
 i think it would create issues amoung the lines of  &apos;wait god can directly talk to us ?
 what about metatron and the pope and the entire god being a being we humans can not comprehend thing ?
 was that a lie ?
 does that mean god has a form now ?
 or at the very least a voice ?
 it would collapse a large portion of theology ,  both modern and old as all of a sudden there &apos;s answers to questions and more questions that we had never even considered .
 imagine the rapture happening ,  the lord himself float down from the heavens .
 the world await his words .
 then ,  with an exasperated tone he exclaim  &apos;listen ,  my name is yeshua ,  get it right you fucks !
 no that &apos;s not how it &apos;s pronounced ,  yeshua is the original hebrew name .
 jesus is just an english translation from his latin name .
 this is why in islam ,  his name is ʿīsā .
 so there &apos;s probably some truth to that here with yeshua .
 i wonder where the pronunciation for jesus came from then ?
 the correct saying is j-money
 eta: thanks for the gold !
 thanks for the jold ,  you mean .
 tell that to my pet goldfish !
 it &apos;s now pronounced ahyah
 jod would have to leave ,  to avoid a line up of a couple billion people ready to slap the shit out of it .
 in hebrew it is יהוה .
 the י can be read as i or y ,   ו is v ,   u or o ,   and ה is h (and a nightmare for people who learn hebrew) .
 jehovah is one of the options to read it .
 usually you would just say lord ,  though (adonai) .
 i &apos;d be like  &apos;what firemaster2311 said &apos;
 how do you pronounce gif ?
 tell that to mr .
 jod was not the impostor
 just a dickhead on a bus
 trying to make his way home .
 jod acting kinda sus
 “jesus” or “the holy spirit” still counts
 fun fact: the word used in torah is “nasa” which means to “to lift up” or “to carry .
 ” so the verse is better translated “you shall not carry yahweh’s name incorrectly .
 ” it has little to do with swearing or invoking ,  and everything to do with representing yahweh in a manner that is respectful to his commands .
 pastor three-jets should still take heed .
 a similar interpretation is to act in a way that makes jesus name less powerful or worthy .
 a  &apos;christian &apos; certainly doesn &apos;t have the same meaning these days .
 they kiiiiiiilled my wife and my baybuh
 having that knowledge is what separates boys from men
 okay ,  there &apos;s my random motivation to go play guitar
 was looking for this my dude
 yhwh just means  &apos;i am .
  &apos; this was the answer given to moses after he tried to get god to tell him his name .
 the egyptians ,  i understand ,  had a belief that if one learned the true name of a deity ,  one gained power over the deity .
 one finds this belief showing up in the story of ra and isis .
 in this cultural context ,  moses &apos; actions can be seen to be quite dishonorable ,  by our standards - he &apos;s trying to trick god into putting himself at moses &apos; mercy .
 the answer god gives is not his real name ,  it is stern correction being given to a human who has far out-stepped his bounds .
 as for what god &apos;s name really is - if he exists ,  how could he possibly have one ?
 we &apos;re talking about somebody has been present in the universe from its beginning ,  and exists outside of it ,  beyond the bounds of space and time .
 why would some collection of sounds that just happen to be easy to pronounce by a collection of barely jumped up apes on an insignificant planet be his name ,  billions of years before the planet said apes live on even existed ?
 the whole  &apos;real name of god &apos; thing is silly ,  just human beings wanting to believe that they &apos;re much more powerful and important than they are .
 wondering what happens to that sort of thinking when we finally meet our first aliens ,  and discover that we &apos;re not the pinnacle of creation ?
 or of existence ,  as the case might be ?
 isn’t it yhwh and no one knows the real vowels in between the consonants ?
 please stop telling me the answer ,  at least 200 people have commented and messaged telling me how ancient hebrew works
 hey how about a spoiler tag ?
 you owe me a new face !
 yahweh true to caesar
 i stand with elohim .
 i fucking love reddit
 you can go yah own weh 
 for jod &apos;s sake people it was a good comment
 it really depends ,  did we all see jod for ourselves ,  or are we taking someone &apos;s word for it ?
 cuz if the pope came out and announced that he alone had this vision my opinion probably wouldn &apos;t change much since i already have my doubts about the pope .
 but if a massive group of people said it ,  maybe that would be different .
 was it a group of people in one place ?
 cuz in that case it could be a massive group hallucination ,  but if people all over the world started saying the same thing on the same day that would definitely cast more doubt over the situation .
 but if jod appeared to every human individually to make this announcement ,  id probably stop being agnostic and be forced to reconcile that jod does exist and everything i know is a lie .
 thanks for the gold !
 my first thought as well
 it confirms that either a god exists or that someone has sufficiently advanced technology .
 gold = money = root of all evil = satan ?
 plot twist: god is actually evil and satan is paradise
 ironic considering he &apos;s jod of football
 ibrahimovic was not an imposter ,  2 imposters remaining .
 zlatan apologizes for calling france earth a shit country planet
 reporter:  &apos;it &apos;s pronounced jod .
 then proceeds to not qualify for the world cup lmao
 earth has been downgraded this year
 well ,  he did go down to georgia
 i feel like if i was god ,  and i had made a tree walk and reversed a river to prove a point ,  and people still weren &apos;t listening to me ,  i &apos;d start smiting them with lightning in the next step and see if they &apos;re still being smartasses after that .
 so the applying the story seems to say god wouldn &apos;t have jurisdiction on how to pronounce english over the written guidance in the torah ,  but in recent america ,  we seem to allow people to have their names pronounced any way they feel like ,  so precedent would be to allow god to set the pronunciation .
 jewish theology seems to consist of a lot of arguing with god ,  pretty lit tbh
 fuck  &apos;to smile &apos; חייך .
 all my homies use  &apos;to laugh at &apos; חייך     .
 קא חייך ואמר נצחוני בני נצחוני בני
 til jewish mythology is way weirder than i originally gave it credit for .
 the jewish religion just became a lot more interesting .
 that story basically seems to be saying that humanism ,  human interpretation and critical thinking ,  and jurisprudence (in general ,  the laws of humanity) should take precedence over miracles and the interpreted word of god .
 that &apos;s interesting to me because that &apos;s more or less the foundation of modern humanism and exactly the opposite of the argument most religious people make about morality .
 if you watch people like harris or hitchens in religious debates ,  they are making exactly this point .
 we were his last choice ,  but he threatened to crush us with a mountain ,  and he didn &apos;t think we &apos;d say yes .
 really ,  that was the first contract negotiation the jewish people ever won
 and it doesn &apos;t help when people always respond to that comment with star wars shit
 mace windu didn &apos;t swear enough .
 honestly i was staring at it like ,  “would they really have said stupid-ass in star wars ?
 it &apos;s nick fucking fury fml .
 at least you got the right actor !
 i &apos;ve had a revelation that i conflate all of jackson &apos;s biggest roles .
 i don &apos;t separate jules from mace windu from nick fury .
 even lucius best is still samuel l .
 his roles are distinct enough that it &apos;s not just dwayne  &apos;the rock &apos; johnson starring as not-the-rock but still .
 frank tenpenny is a subversion to this .
 dude was that much of an asshole that in spite of clearly be the voice of samuel l jackson he &apos;s far out of the norm .
 stephen from django too .
 general kenobi ,  you are in the wrong universe
 and in swedish jud would be a homophone for ljud(sound) .

 “where’s your god now ?
 “in my pants you pervert !
 you thought it was jod ,  but it was me ,  dioz !
 careful ,  hayven sounds like a utah name
  &apos;who gets control of jerusalem this week ?
 rolls 20-sided die
 as an agnostic ,  i’m pretty sure if i saw god i would no longer have any doubt
  &apos;god exists &apos; would just mean  &apos;kill god &apos; goes back on the bucket list .
 there is a book ,  called the dresden files .
 one character is a holy knight ,  given a sword by the angel uriel .
 that character is also a athiest/agnostic .
 dresden asks him how he can be that when he works for a literal angel .
 he said something to the effect of  &apos; idk if hes an angel .
 he could be a alien for all i know &apos; .
 there would be a lot of that .
 probably an alien .
 or an interdimensional  being .
 cus god doesnt exist .
 did you mean  &apos;the jreat schism &apos; ?
 there is no argument ,  because jraphical isn &apos;t a word .
 attempting to argue that it &apos;s pronounced jif makes you look like a dumbass and will result in an automatic block .
 that’s enough mr west please no more today
 yeezy yeezy what’s good
 this ask reddit is kind of how real jewish/christians religions couldnt agree for a long time on how gods real name yhwh should be pronounced .
 have you seen the famous documentary on religion with morgan freeman ,  jod ?
 what if jod was one of us ?
  &apos;if god is jod   .
 and jod is he ,    .
 then what am i   .
 is really jay ,    .
 then what &apos;s a juy   .
  &apos;you see ,  &apos; said he ,    .
  &apos;i am confused ,    .
 i am perplexed   .
 and vexed ,  abused ,    .
 and all unsure   .
 for sure ,  &apos; said him ,    .
  &apos;because ,  &apos; he said: .
 my name is jim gim .
 jo ,  jo ,  jodzilla !
 this is pretty much what it would take to get me to to accept the  &apos;jif &apos; pronunciation
 soft g as in ‘jiff on my tits’ not a hard g as in ‘gif me your load’ .
 at least that’s how your mom explained it to me .
 was really hoping it was going to be the first comment .
  &apos;naming differences are dumb .
 gorilla omnipotent deity .
 apparently ,  of all the troubles on earth and the flaws in mankind ,  the pronunciation of jod as god was the only thing he saw fit to correct
 doesn &apos;t god talk directly to people plenty in the old testament ?
 i mean we wouldn’t understand him because he spoke aramaic so
 i guess the modern version would be .
 it was yeshua in hebrew ,   &apos;jesus &apos; comes from a latin bastardization (iesus) of the greek bastardization of that name ,  which sounds like  &apos;ee-soos &apos; .
 your pet joldfish
 i gave you science ,  the intelligence and enough resources on this planet to solve any problems and you lousy apes spend most of it on technology and munitions to kill each other .
  in my name most of the time ,  no less .
 i tried reading that and suddenly my pen got enchanted with fire aspect ii
 nobody calls over the phone .
 this is jod awful
 geesus christ man .
 watch your language .
 its pronounced   &apos;hey zeus &apos;  .
 its actually pronounced gesus
 it &apos;s pronounced gee-zus
 so the american space agency is taking the lord &apos;s name in vain ?
 i’ll talk shit about jod all day for three jets .
 with hopes to enslave muh
 men from legends
 we &apos;re talking about somebody has been present in the universe from its beginning ,  and exists outside of it ,  beyond the bounds of space and time .
 its almost as if  &apos;i am &apos; is a perfectly fitting name for such a god .
 i honestly have no idea why people are upvoting this .
 play hangman until you get smited ,  boom you figured out the vowels
 yes ,  nobody is quite sure how the name was pronounced by the ancient israelites .
  it doesn &apos;t help that most jewish priests refrained from speaking the name in public .
  yahweh is a common guess ,  so is yehovah (hence the jehovah &apos;s witnesses) .
 i did say “approximately” .
 i’m not an expert in this .
 you could be right .
 what does the fox say ?
 the characters are you ,  he ,  waw ,  and he .
  in unpointed biblical hebrew ,  most vowels are not written and others are written ambiguously .
  therefore it can be difficult to deduce how a word is pronounced from its spelling .
 the most interesting thing to me about the three great  &apos;monotheistic &apos; religions is that they aren &apos;t in fact monotheistic at all .
  yhwh was one god of many alongside ba &apos;al ,  anat ,  dagan ,  etc .
  he was just a specific region &apos;s god ,  hence his decree that  &apos;thou shalt have no other gods but me &apos; .
  his people had access to papyrus and got a headstart on documenting their stories and rules with written language ,  so now we have the world we have ,  for better or worse .
 go yah-own-weh aaa aaa
 all yhwh ,  to fucking victory town
 i’ve always thought that would be amazing if he just appeared in the sky in a way everyone could see and had such a booming voice and suddenly over night everyone had no choice but to believe .
 ironically in 50 years people would say it’s just a legend and not believe it
 zlatan = tall football player
 or just a fallen anjel
 given the events that transpired in the old testament ,  i think humans were ,  are and will always be smartasses .
 scientists have extended our lifespans by decades ,  allowed for us to travel faster than the speed of sound ,  be able to leave our planet entirely and still come back alive in what is essentially a comet made of metal ,  and created foods that go unspoiled for decades .
 all of this ,  and still ,  nobody listens to them when they try to help us .
 i can see why god got so fed up he finally just told noah to get the ark .
 this might be why atheists are so reviled .
    jod is punishing everyone because i don’t believe in him .
 yeah it’s like jesus and jesus .
 very different pronunciations just in north america alone .
 if the only thing it did was to correct a pronunciation and left ,   no one would care and things would quickly go back to normal .
  if it tried to come back as a human ,  the evangelicals would quickly try to crucify it .
 i once asked my rabbi ,   &apos;if judaism forbids the destruction of media containing god &apos;s name ,  does it permit minimizing windows on a computer ?
 he had an answer for that .
 apparently ,  destruction of god &apos;s name only applies to non-temporal surfaces ,  so tracing the name in sand on the beach or holding the name written backwards up to a mirror and then taking it away don &apos;t count ,  and therefore neither does the name on an electronic display .
 ancient explanations for modern problems ,  it &apos;s pretty crazy .
 my favorite is still ilan ramon asking for advice on when to celebrate the sabbath while in low earth orbit given that there &apos;s a new sunset every 90 minutes .
 they still had an answer .
 bottom line--ceremonies are observed based on spacecraft time ,  which is based on the control center time .
 it &apos;s literally in the name .
 israel =  &apos;wrestles with god &apos; .
 latin does the same thing .
  &apos;ridere &apos; means to smile or laugh .
 yeah man it &apos;s pretty much an endless rabbit hole of jewish philosophical literature
 yeah i want to read more of these stories
 humanism is very pervasive in rabbinic judaism and would even go so far as to call it it &apos;s foundation .

 so you are saying that the format developed by the  joint photographic experts group should be pronounced .
 there &apos;s no rule that the acronym has to have each letter pronounced like the word it represents ,  otherwise you &apos;d go to the atm and get cash using your pine and the agency ensuring workplace safety would be ose-ha .
 the case for gif is that graphical has a hard g .
 the case for jif is that the creator of the file format says it should be jif .
 both cases have enough merit to call it an argument .
 ah yes ,  because the p in jpeg comes from potograph .
 lol this dude blocking because people don &apos;t pronounce things the way he likes ,  have you never met a brit/american/australian/south african person (remove whichever you are ,  if applicable) in real life ?
 specially funny when i also pronounce it  &apos;gif &apos; ,  not  &apos;jif &apos; ,  i was merely pointing out how stupid your argument is .
 what if you pronounce it  &apos;giraffe-ical &apos; ?
 i think that logic makes someone look like a dumbass ,  and i don &apos;t even pronounce it like jif .
 i read as giraffe-ical
 judiasm does have an agreed upon pronunciation .
 the answer is  &apos;it &apos;s none of your business &apos; .
 the true answer has been lost to time ,  when the romans killed the two people (the high priest and his apprentice) who knew how to pronounce the tetragrammon .

 holy fuck this comment was straight fire
 jesus fucking christ you didnt need to kill him
 there are dozens of us
 i mean look at how many of the ten commandments he dedicated to just how we interact with him .
 it seems to be very god-like to just give a shit about that and not much else .
 maybe we can speed up the second coming if we all just pretended we forgot what his name was .
 as an atheist who has read bible ,  not really all that surprising .
 kneel before jod .
 you’re putting what symbols around your necks !
  &apos;new religion ,  who dis ?
 gesus fucking christ .
 conjures images of geesus ,  the goose of jod .

 he was a carpenter .
 everyone knows all carpenters are hispanic .
 no ,  it &apos;s lifting up or carrying ,  in a broad sense ,  which is weirdly accurate .
 just cuz i aintsayinit
 no ,  it would be a perfectly fitting label for human beings to apply to such a deity ,  but for us to think of the labels we apply to those who were around before us as their names would be vanity ,  indeed .
 think of the nicknames our little nieces and nephews attach to us .
 those names make sense to our little ones ,  but are they really our names ?
 fuck ,  the secret pronunciation !
 my face is melting !
 oh shit ,  gods just mario doing a double jump !
 it all makes sense now !
 it &apos;s pronounced yahowaha smh
 that sounds like a noise luigi would make after doing a down smash in super smash brother
 pretty sure it &apos;s yeehaawoohoo !
 “jehovah” was a placeholder: the vowels of adonai (“lord”) instead of the real vowels of the ineffable name of god ,  to remind the priests to say adonai instead .
  &apos;look ,  i &apos;d had a lovely supper ,  and all i said to my wife was  &apos;that piece of halibut was good enough for jehovah &apos; &apos; .
 but in the latin alphabet ,   &apos;jehovah &apos; begins with an  &apos;i &apos; .
 jehovah &apos;s witnesses  .
 i think you mean gehovah
 well ,  yahweh did claim to be mightier than the other gods (or the only one with might or at least certain powers the others lacked) .
 also ,  yahweh was afraid of humans eating from specific trees ,  and organizating to build a high tower .
 so that &apos;s kind of weird .
 henotheism is the word that describes a religion that adheres to one particular god or set of gods without necessarily denying other deities .
 you can call it anotherrrrrr lonely daeeeee
 i think people would still agree it happened but invent all sorts of crazy conspiracies around it .
 after all ,  we all know jod doesn’t burn hot enough to melt steel pillars .
 i feel like a lot of people would immediately pull their phones out if that happened so i dont think we would have the issue of people thinking it &apos;s a legend in the future
 i’m stoned as fuck rn and just read the part about him appearing and his voice booming and i tensed myself as if it was about to happen

 moses opened the red sea in front of thousands of people ,  but when he left the camp to speak to god on mount sinai for 1 month ,  the hebrews began to worship a golden cow .
 he took them out of egypt ,  but egypt never left them .
 it was part of the hebrew culture at that point .
 people seem to love the “smite the nonbelievers and send them plagues” old testament god more than the “love thy neighbor” new testament version

  homie’s probably a smartass too
 this made my laugh hard .
 i just see a dude named noah ,  working in an office when he suddenly hears .
  &apos;i &apos;m sick of this shit .
 noah ,  fetch the ark &apos;
  &apos;i &apos;ve heard it both ways .
 dead messiahs are far more useful than live ones .
 for a certain type of mind the arguments in rabbinic judaism are incredibly fun to go through .
 its basically one big litigation soap opera .
 i once asked my rabbi ,   &apos;if judaism forbids the destruction of media containing god &apos;s name ,  does it permit minimizing windows on a computer ?
 he had an answer for that .
 apparently ,  destruction of god &apos;s name only applies to non-temporal surfaces ,  so tracing the name in sand on the beach or holding the name written backwards up to a mirror and then taking it away don &apos;t count ,  and therefore neither does the name on an electronic display .
 ancient explanations for modern problems ,  it &apos;s pretty crazy .
  i &apos;m not religious ,  but i would have said that minimising a window is not an act of  &apos;destruction &apos; in any case ,  since data is not lost .
  securely erasing a file may be an act of destruction .
 what did he mean by non-temporal ,  do you know ?
 i’m sick of theses motherfucking siths ,  on this motherfucking plane .

 you mean you pronounce the l audibly and then the j ?
 that &apos;s quite a tongue twister i would say .
 well if it was just a situation of a deity/god/creator or whatever revealing themselves ,  and everyone else witnessed it too ,  i &apos;d be pretty quick to accept it .
 but if they literally just came down to tell us it &apos;s pronounced  &apos;jod &apos; and then left ,  i &apos;d be right there with you .
 or maybe i &apos;d think  &apos;well ,  looks like the simulation theory was right ,  and now they &apos;re bored and just messing with us &apos; ,  which given the past couple of years isn &apos;t such a crazy theory !
 anybody who &apos;s played a city builder game knows that once things reach a certain point ,  you turn to messing things up for everyone .

 i was really getting in to legal/lawyer podcats ,  but they &apos;ve gotten a bit stale .
 i think i know what my next step will be now .
 i would assume non-temporal mean not temporary .
 so like ,  carving the lord’s name into a stone tablet would be permanent ,  so breaking that tablet is forbidden .
 but something like a window on a computer is meant to be changed and erased at will ,  so it is temporary ,  thus not forbidden .

 i &apos;m sure there would be plenty of people who would argue it was some form of mass hysteria ,  and i would also be inclined to believe that i must have temporarily lost my mind .
 but i &apos;d probably come to accept it if we all saw it .
 the problem here is that  &apos;being a god &apos; is so subjective that you can hardly prove your god hood .
 you turned water into wine ?
 that &apos;s cool ,  but what does that make you ?
 a god or a wizard ?
 and if god is real ,  who says it &apos;s the only god ?
 what if odin comes down next ?
 and if that is the case ,  who is more powerful ?
 because if those gods exist then maybe some lovecraft ian shit exists too .
 you can spiral this whole thing out of control really fast .
 also it can always be a man behind a curtain .
 who just happens to have a very high tech curtain like most races in stargate who pretended to be gods but we &apos;re just advancdd
 i would simply go from  &apos;there is no god &apos; to  &apos;okay ,  fine ,  jod exists ,  but he &apos;s a real piece of shit unworthy of my worship so i &apos;m right back where i started in continuing to live my life as a decent person .

 no ,  that was the second 40-year wandering .
 the first time it took 40 years to get to israel ,  at which point scouts reported a number of well-defended cities .
 enough jews took this news seriously that god got offended at the audacity of the jews to doubt his ineffable plan after 40 years of doing nothing that god ordered them to spend another 40 years wandering the desert ,  thus allowing all the doubters to die of old age and the next generation was then allowed entrance to the holy land .
 looking back ,  the 40 years has got to be a bit of poetic license .
 otherwise one has to question why the jews took 40 years to travel maybe 250 miles .
 like ,  i &apos;m pretty sure glaciers are faster than the jews here .
 there &apos;s an interesting argument that you can never convince a human of a transcendental event/being ,  because we always will try to excuse it as the material .

 it was undoubtedly not 40 years .
 the bible uses the number 40 specifically a lot of times(eg .
 40 days and 40 nights) so i’ve come to the conclusion that it doesn’t mean 40 ,  it just means a lot .
 yeah uhh i think they took a lot of poetic license while writing this stuff if i had to take a guess .
 honey ,  where my supersuit is ?
 another issue would be  &apos;what action qualifies one to be originator and owner of the universe &apos; lets for a second imagine that an advanced alien showed up and started performing what we would call miracles and called themselves  jod .

 is the supervisor automatically jod now ?
 and what about all of the unknown aliens there are as we climb higher on their extraterrestrial corporate ladder ?
 all of this to say ,  just because an extremely powerful being shows up does not mean they are a) going to be honest or b) know what the hell theyre talking about .
 like ,  if say loki or some other trickster god showed ,  flashed some power and lied through their teeth i guarantee you they could drum up a following ,  hell ordinary scum lords like teal horse do that shit day and night ,  how would i tell the difference ?
 how do you pronounce that ?

 what about subs that crosspost from other subs to mock them ?
 the karmaceutical companies would be outraged .
 it would be weird to see a post in a smaller subreddit with thousands of points just because it got crossposted somewhere more popular .
 the thing is that a good post on one sub might be a bad post on another .
 if something is relevant in one sub but irrelevant in another ,  the downvotes from the sub where it &apos;s not relevant would take upvotes from the post that &apos;s highly relevant .
 will totally lead to abuse
 would prevent karma theft
 are imaginary points really that important to you ?
 ehh ,  sometimes you crosspost because op was a dick ,  so no
 different subs exist for different content .
 should upvotes on /r/watchpeopledie boost a troll post to /r/aww  ?
 what about downvotes ?
 too many ways to abuse that system .
 you would have people cross-posting their shitposts all over the place .
 karma farmers will just download and reupload the image before posting instead of using the crosspost function .
       regardless ,  i think it &apos;d be a nice feature .
 i dunno op how would you feel about world peace ?
 i would rather have development go into a feature where a user doesn &apos;t see crossposted content more than one time in their feed .
 karma literally does nothing
 just because a post is good/bad on one subreddit doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s good/bad on another subreddit .
 how would you feel if people didn &apos;t use askreddit for stupid shit like this ?
 this is not a good idea .
  think about it: someone could game the system and self-cross-post their own work to garner more publicity .
  imagine a musician wants to post their song ,  after posting a on a major subreddit they could then cross post to all the music subreddits out there that they feel fall within that subreddits guidelines ,  and even four or five extra upvotes from each subreddits means their post would become extremely popular on the subreddit they originally intended .
 maybe this only would be a good idea if a certain threshold was met .
 how about when a repost if upvoted the karma goes to the original .
 reddit is entirely comprised of either self posts ,  or links to other posts on other sites .
 another post in another subreddit is no different - just sharing content from elsewhere outside the target sub .
 seems like another easy way to farm karma .
 it would ruin subreddits like r/lostredditors
 god yall care too much about internet points
 on one hand that would be helpful most of the time ,  and on the other there are many instances where a post is appropriate for the subreddit to which it was crossposted but not the original .
 for instance ,  i regularly see crossposts from r/youdontmattergiveup to r/dontdeadopeninside for which i would like to upvote the crosspost but downvote (and report) the original post .
 conversely ,  there are crossposts that i would like to downvote for being off-topic but i would like to upvote the original .
 what i would like to see is upvote and downvote buttons within the crosspost window thing .
 how about who gives a fuck about karma .
 people could potentially game the system to artificially boost posts by crossposting to a ton of subs .
 i see this as an absolute win
 why are you asking this like you have the power to do something about it ?
 i just wouldn &apos;t care .
 it &apos;s fake internet points that do nothing .
 how about reddit gets rid of this upvote/downvote bullshit all together and just let people discuss .
 no more karma  crap .
 why do people care about karma ?
 except that it &apos;s artificially created drama by the developers and people fall for it .
 it &apos;s hard to express how much i wouldn &apos;t care .
 or just remove karma so people stop whoring for karma .
 karma bots would have a fucking field day
 not a fan because a post is as much about the context of the sub as it is about the content .
 the relevance of subject matter will vary by subreddit .
 relevance of a crosspost to r/totallynotrobots has no bearing on how appropriate the original post was to r/aliensamongus ,  and visa-versa .
 i &apos;d feel indifferent .
 my penis won &apos;t grow bigger from getting a bajillion internet points .
 how about only the op gets the upvotes on their account ,  but the repost still trends according to current upvotes ?
 just because someone posted a submission that is off-topic in a specific  subreddit ,  that is then crossposted to a more appropriate subreddit and  becomes successful ,  does not mean that the original poster gets credit  for posting something that doesn’t fit in the original subreddit .
 people would cross post their own shit in as many subs as they could find to whore for karma and reddit would get even shittier than it already is .
 that would be amazing .
 i think if implemented correctly ,  it really could work .
 but it needs to be more than just  &apos;if repost is upvoted ,  the original post also gets an upvote &apos; ,  in order to prevent abuse .
 but it totally could work ,  and it would also give credit to the original post - especially if it &apos;s not the same poster ,  and the new post has way more upvotes than the original .
 but it needs to be implemented correctly .
 i would also feel pretty good about a feature that upvoted the original post when someone steals karma from  a good one by reposting it as their own .
 i think that back when reddit started 12 years ago ,  most of the audience were it people sitting in server rooms typing halfway thoughtful comments on keyboards .
 now that it’s just a bunch of 12-year-old dip shit saying whatever comes into their stupid little heads on their cell phones i think the quality has dropped .
 you can rearrange the deck chairs on this titanic all you want but the fact is they captured lightning in a bottle and then they let it go .
 someone else is going to capture that lightning and that’s where i’d like to devote my creative energy .
 sounds fair to me
 this would be an epic addition to reddit .
 i have had people cross post things by me and get 3x the amount of upvotes ,  and have me accused of reposts .

 i already hate the voting system .
 do not support .
 nearly 180 days since this post has been created .
 2 days until this post gets archived .
 upvotes and downvotes are meaningless so why complicate uselessness ?
 how about a feature where you can cash your karma for real world currency
 i see double ,  triple ,  n-times voting on the same post .
 i like the idea but some posts don &apos;t fit particular subs ,  so a post not appropriate for a sub could get upvoted because it was crossposted into a more fitting sub .
 is joe biden plagiarizing again ?
 sort by top in a lot of small subreddits would be skewed heavily by crossposts to major subreddits
 i could see this being abused .
 like it but would depend on the context of the subreddit
 problem is with crossposts that criticize or make fun of the original
 it sounds okay ,  butt i might not wanna upvote the post in the original sub , 
 tell me how anyone could ever successfully implement that ,  and i &apos;m on board .
 would be better if it upvotes the original and downvoted the copy post
 i like this idea ,  but maybe allow mods to turn it off on their sub .
 no because the individual communities should decide what gets up voted in their sub .
 however links to the same source content reposted within a certain time frame should have this happen ,  where the original post gets the karma .
 sometimes posts are upvoted because they fit the theme of the subreddit very well .
 for example ,  if someone crossposts something from r/funny onto r/breathinginformation then there would be no correlation between the 2 posts getting upvotes .
 if you upvote the post on r/breathinginformation ,  you &apos;re not saying it &apos;s particularly funny ,  and vice versa .
 when upvoting ,  context matters .
 there are some problems ,  maybe just make the upvote/downvote buttons there for the original and xpost .
 original might be a r/lostredditors case ,  while the second one is posted in the correct subreddit .
 also ,  it is good the way it is i don &apos;t think there is need for a change .
 casually crossposts to a q&a subreddit
 no ,  the original might not be the best place for the post but if it hits r/all then it &apos;s the best post of that sub ,  having even if its not relevant to the original sub .
 if you want to be a karma whore do like every other karma whore .
 it makes me realize i prefer my entertainment platforms to be autocracies ,  not democracies .
 i don’t care about points or karma or who made what ,  or who has seen it before me ,  or even if i’ve seen it before .
 just give me cat pics and little kids falling off bikes .
 massive potential for abuse .
 just crosspost as much as possible to maximize karma .
 you &apos;d basically be parallelizing karma farming ,  which on the one hand appeals to me as someone who like process optimization ,  but on the other hand would probably lead to an excess of  duplicated posts .
 you work for me because someone crossposted my oc and got a platinum and silver while my post got 30k less upvotes and no awards
 wouldn’t matter because karma is fake
 i thought that is how it works
 i would feel like reddit is doing something great for the original creators .
 test it ,  if it helps with rampant reposts: awesome .
 if reposts  become literally every post then burn it with fire
 i usually just clicked the original post and upvote that one
 we should have a feature where if you reply to a comment ,  that comment that you reply to is automatically upvoted
 you could use that to get double karma
 if i like it ,  i will go to the original post and upvote it there too manually
 woah ,  or even credit original poster for reposts ?
 make it so that it does this unless the crosspost title is marked with /s for sarcasm/satire
 you &apos;d have to have a subreddit that tracked it all to stop the trolling .
 otherwise the pedos et al .
 are going to have a field day .
 i love the idea ,  but just too many sickos out there .
 i dont think this is a good idea .
 one vote per person is the foundation of democracy .
 also it would encourage mass cross posting .
 i am not in favour of this idea .
 reddit how do you feel about having old people perform a mandatory drivers test every year ?
 that &apos;s some fuckin &apos; communist shit
 this feature would be abused to inflate post karma across different subs ,  e .
 post trump negative in r_the donald then x-post to r_impeach trump .
 then watch the chaos erupt !
 what if the original post doesn &apos;t apply to its sub ?
 i can see this being abused by karma whores .
 it will be exploited .
 would prevent karma thieves (which is mostly worthless anyway) but will be sweet candies for karma farm bots .
 they can crosspost everywhere they please and before you know it ,  the entire front page is one video from r/funny in 20 different subs .
 i feel like this should’ve been a thing since the beginning .
 read other points about abuse ,  and that in one sub it would be humorous and in another serious etc .
 and agree maybe it actually isn’t a good idea .
 i &apos;d just crosspost my post to infinite subs .
 except sometimes cross posts are done to talk shit about said cross post so there &apos;d have to be the option to prevent that or undo it .
 if the original title is shit i don &apos;t want it getting my upvote
 well for one original posts are usually stolen content from other sites like twitter .
 so they don &apos;t necessarily deserve the karma .
 second ,  content means something different in different subreddits .
 votes are partly meant to be an indicator if the content belongs in a particular subreddit .
 so no ,  for those two reasons it is a bad idea .
 subs that crosspost things out of criticism / as a joke would be pretty much destroyed ,  as crosspost filled subs such as /r/upvotedbecausegirl  ,  /r/unbgbbiivchidctiicbg and /r/whatcouldgowrong would be affected heavily
 i don &apos;t want my upvote for a post making fun of orginal op &apos;s idiocy to benefit said orginal op .
 it would create a reason to create a shitty posts ,  repost them to subs about shitty posts and gain karma .
 people would start posting screenshots
  crossposts have to stand on their own .
 if you implemented this ,   then crossposts become a kind of vote manipulation .
 imagine i post in r/catsbeingassholes and crosspost to r/ginger ,  r/gonemild ,  and r/clownporn .
 suddenly my 100 kitten peeing in a shoe upvotes is magically 400 upvotes .
 who cares that much about upvotes ?
 don &apos;t turn reddit into youtube ,  i bet the next stage is profile with 100k+ karma doing adverts .
 people actually use those arrows ?
 i only upvote the original ,  never the crosspost ,  but this would save me time .
 there should be a special button for crossposts that allows you to do this .
 there are some crossposts that are meant to critique or mock .
 i do love the idea ,  but because of that ,  i think having the option to upvote both or just the crosspost would be great !
 are you suggesting a pyramid scheme ?
 that just seems logical in my eyes
 i would love this .
 i’ve reposted stuff before ,  not for karma ,  just for interest and it would be awesome if the original poster got credit for it too .
 yeah ,  i was hoping someone had already commented this .
 i &apos;d hate to upvote a critique of something i disagree with only for the despicable thing to also get upvoted .
 don &apos;t crosspost because that gives a clickable link ,  which can drive traffic there unintentionally .
 if subs can choose to use the feature or not use it ,  that shouldn &apos;t be an issue .
 also some posts get posted for completely different reasons .
 i might upvote some video of a woman going crazy in public on /r/publicfreakout  ,  but would not want to upvote it on a sexist sub that associates her actions exclusively with her gender for example .
 same thing happens with political articles where people post for very different reasons
 it shouldn &apos;t count for non-participation links .
 i guess it could be a toggle thing
 i think it’s only fair ,  i agree 100% .
 i feel like those are very rarely crossposts .
 and they shouldn’t be - they should be providing an “np” link in the text of their post .
 i like the double edged sword of it !
 could just do a crosspost flair or tag that identifies it is an  &apos;anti-crosspost &apos; or something similar and the upvotes and down votes would transfer to the opposite on the op
 let &apos;s hope big karma doesn &apos;t hear about this then .
 we really need to do something about unidan shkreli smh .
 big karma keeping us down .
 i was thinking along those lines .
 a lot of subs only want fitting content upvoted ,  but drama ,  and cringe-type subreddits in particular could cause the wrong content being pushed to the top .
 this would be heavily abused by spammers .
 here &apos;s a scenario for you: .
 op wants to karma farm .
 op uses an old repost that was really popular a few years ago .
 op posts that on a large sub .
 op then goes onto their alternate accounts or their spam bot ring and posts crossposts to the original post on a ton of smaller subs ,  thus propelling the original post by boosting the karma score on it well beyond any downvotes for the flagrant reposting .
 let &apos;s say it &apos;s on a big sub ,  so now op has an account that got several thousand upvotes quickly .
 rinse and repeat ,  then sell the  &apos;legitimate &apos; account to an advertiser online .
 people still have to upvote ,  and they can already spam subs with unrelated content .
 maybe have it as an option for subs to turn on (that posts crossposted from the sub with it on get automatic upvotes) ?
 not sure how doable that is or if its worth the effort though
 i don’t see that happening .
   after all ,  the karma in the original post doesn’t get transported to the cross post .
   it’s the other way around .
 the only way to get around this is to not affect the post score but still give them karma directly .
 weird ,  but not wrong .
   and the phenomena already happens when a post gets a rapid amount of upvotes in a small community and gets posted to r/all .
    most small communities i participate in have posts with huge karma spikes from that .
 why would that be weird or bad ?
 there seems to be a problem with reddit that some people use it to see specific ,  community focused things while others are looking for broader ,  more generic entertainment .
 the second group seems to slowly erode the identity of any sufficiently popular sub to eventually just have nothing but the same content all the other subs have .
 such a system would only further that process .
 i was looking for this response because i completely agree .
 i had the exact situation last week ,  where a cross-posted item was totally inappropriate for the sub i was in while in the original sub it was perfectly fine .
 i actually downvoted the cross-post ,  but upvoted the original .
 yup ,  people seem to forget that an upvote does not mean  &apos;i agree &apos; ,  an upvote means  &apos;this contributes to the conversation &apos; .
 so by allowing what op asked ,  we are disregarding the fundamental purpose of reddit .
 agreed ,  terrible idea .
 it may be completely irrelevant in another sub (thus deserving of downvotes) .
 i wish this was how things worked in /r/facepalm and /r/nonononoyes ,  but alas — once the sub gets too big ,  nobody votes based on whether content fits the sub or not .
  i think lately people have started to just upvote everything they find interesting/funny regardless of the sub .
  automatic upvoting would only make the situation worse .
 yup ,  this would cause super posts which would absolutely be abused by various subs (we all know who)
 everyone can make an unlimited amount of subreddits and crosspost and upvote themselves infinitely
 had that happend to me once but i stole the karma .
 ah yes ,  the most heinous crime know to man .
 what does karma theft even mean
 stupid fucking thing to care about .
 i cross posted something and got a platinum .
 felt kind of dirty
 i think it &apos;s meant so people cross post instead of stealing the content and uploading it themselves without giving credit
 people would stop cross-posting
 then i just download it and upload it and the repost gets worse on quality without credit to the original
 would increase farming along the same lines .
 post a: get 300 votes   .
 xpost b (a): gets 450 votes - post a now at 750   .
 and keep the share going as the typical karma farming repost machine gains votes exponentially
 i sure do love making a post ,  getting 200 karma ,  then someone crossposting and getting 4k karma and then having the audacity to tag me .
 its so annoying when someone crossposts to another sub ,  and then the crossposted post gets tons of gilding and upvotes .
 reddit should automatically add the upvotes to the original post .
 that shit requires karma insurance
 karma theft happens because of repost and people stealing other post .
 at least with crosspost you know someone else made it
  &apos;karma theft &apos; jesus fucking christ
 image a post to a subreddit that has a more serious focus that frowns upon shitposts ,  but it suddenly gets to the front page because it was crossposted and upvoted within a meme subreddit .
  that kind of content ,  while vastly popular elsewhere ,  doesn’t belong everywhere .
 you don’t want “kill yourself” jokes filling the top posts of suicide support groups ,  or rule 34 porn filling the top of children’s show subreddits .
  this just creates more work for moderators to have to deal with front page trolling .
 they would still get an upvote
 they &apos;d get the same karma farmed ,  crosspost and repost gets the same result .
 why do the extra effort of reposting ?
 i &apos;m more afraid of the same farmer double-dipping by crossposting .
 karma farming at its finest
 actually ,  what op described is a pretty terrible idea .
 crossposts are used just as often as not to deliver a different message to the original .
 i &apos;d just be happy if my feed would update more often than once every fifth sunday .
 that would be extremely difficult to program as if you test to see if a repost matches the original by x% then meme formats would cease to exist but if it goes by 100% may he then you could simply crop or put a filter over the image .
 big oof i’m wrong
 r/pics in shambles .
 this would be great as long as it &apos;s a repost in the same subreddit .
 crossposts made into invite-only subreddits should be explicitly disqualified from this ,  for exactly this reason .
 i don &apos;t follow the logic at all here .
 how to crossposts ,  trolling ,  and pedos at all relate to one another ?
 you &apos;d just have to go to the original post and downvote it there .
 an upvote is not an agree button .
 to be fair they generated enough interest to get you involved .
 they kinda deserve the proxy vote .
 make it an optional setting when crossposting ?
 if someone already commented what you hoped they had ,  does upvoting your comment automatically upvotes the original comment ,  too ?
 you could always have the option to manually downvote or de-upvote it i guess
 maybe a green upvote button on the right to upvote both posts
 if an op is given the ability to sticky a comment on their own post ,  they could comment and sticky the link ,  then copy/paste or screenshot the subject matter .
 plus it &apos;s contamination/brigading which then gives them something to be mad about to justify not listening to anything anyone else has to say .
 you can post things to laud or mock them within a single sub .
 hasn &apos;t /r/publicfreakout pretty much already been taken over by the pussypassdenied crowd anyway ?
 the r/shitxsays subs do that a lot; there should be a toggle on the crosspost screen for this
 you didn &apos;t think this through ,  did you .
 it’d have to be on by default .
 so when you turn it on ,  upvote on your cross post is an upvote on theirs .
 but when it’s off nothing happens .
 having it so an upvote on the cross post is a downvote on the original sounds cool ,  but it promotes bigrading .
 how about if the title is the exact same and there is nothing extra then it upvotes it at the same time ?
 if anything is different then it wont .
 if it was a toggle then people just won’t use it i think .
 it was always a treat seeing his comments :/ ever since his scandal went down i havent seen any accounts like his since .
 havent even seen poem for a sprog around either
 you &apos;re not thinking eighth dimensionally .
 don &apos;t eliminate it ,  monetize it .
 they could create  &apos;re-post karma &apos; ,  which would be a system that compares new posts to all previous posts ,  and if it matches anything already posted ,  the votes get inverted .
 of course that would require a ton of computational power ,  which would actually legitimize the new award system ,  because those 15 centuries of server time that were paid for by reddit gold now only account for 7 .
 4 minutes of server time .
 plus some posts are suitable for more than one subreddit .
 and sometimes enough time passes between reposts that the majority of users haven &apos;t seen the original .
 so to them ,  it &apos;s not a repost .
 karma farm accounts would abuse the shit out of it .
 right now they &apos;ll take a popular post and crosspost it to 10 or so subs ,  and get 10x the upvotes .
  if each of those is a crosspost ,  then it would be conservatively 19x upvotes ,  or up to 55x the upvotes (depending on how crossposts of crossposts work) .
 also it would flood the front page with identical posts that are all just crossposts of each other .
 not to mention how easy it would be to game the system to get a post to the front page .
 presumably in this (stupid) system ,  only upvotes would transfer to the original post and not downvotes .
 so if you wanted to farm upvotes on a particular post you could crosspost it to 10 subreddits ,  and receive upvotes from the original sub you posted on plus the 10 other subs ,  but only receive downvotes on the original .
 only votes from the sub the link is posted should have an effect on the ranking in that subreddit .
 one other workaround i see is for it to only happen on a sub that you &apos;re already subscribed to so that it &apos;s still only the original community participating in the original post .
 that said that doesn &apos;t solve the context issue that other people have pointed out; there are posts i would upvote on one sub but downvote on another depending on how it fits the subreddit .
 that &apos;s already commonly seen as a problem on smaller subs ,  i see no reason to further encourage it by forcing it into the site mechanics .
 imagine a sub has 200 subscribers .
 someone posts a picture there that the sub &apos;s users find moderately amusing/relevant ,  and upvote it accordingly .
 it does well ,  but isn &apos;t anywhere near their most popular post of all time .
 then ,  bobby comes along and crossposts the image to /r/funny  .
 he manages to hit that fabled sweet spot that gets it to the front page ,  and the crosspost gets thousands of upvotes .
 with this new feature ,  the original also gets thousands of upvotes ,  and now vastly outranks anything else that has ever been posted on that original sub - even though subscribers there thought it was only so-so .
  some people use it to see specific ,  community focused things .
 just like to give a shoutout to reddit for that .
  if i finish a movie ,  tv series or book i &apos;m always straight on to read the subreddit for it .
  it &apos;s so nice to have a place that is filed by interest rather than who you know / who is popular .
 it’s probably because of all the people who switch to reddit from facebook .
 “oh nooooo my privacy !
 ooooooh what’s reddit ?
 “its a message board with dedicated communities so that you can share what you know ,  and learn with like minded individuals .
 “ewwwww i just want a news feed .
 just low quality memes .
 yea ,  most subs go to shit when they get popular enough
 i find that behaviour perplexing .
 for me whether a content is relevant to the sub can make or break the post so seeing any post get to the top any sub is infuriating .
 lots of the ruin of popular subs can be traced directly back to that behaviour .
 is this the fault of new reddit or something ?
 (we all know who) .
 the famous subreddit no one is mentioning ,  got it .
 everything’s made up and the points don’t matter
 don’t really know reddit etiquette yet ,  but is crossposting considered rude ?
 i made the front page by stealing content .
 give my karma back damn you .
 it &apos;s like kill-stealing in an online shooter but somehow even more sad to watch people complain about .
 seriously ,  i wish  &apos;karma &apos; wasnt a thing ,  people get so petty over a stupid fucking number .
 this whole post in a nutshell .
 na just karmawhores who steal other people &apos;s posts would stop .
 the people that cross post their own oc would still benefit from spreading their post
 would you rather them not tag you .
 seems like people would just complain for the source
 if they download the image and re-upload the image ,  reddit (the system) will just recognize it as a  &apos;new &apos; image thus ,  loophole .
 unless you mean reddit somehow scans it and gives the original upvotes ,  which i really doubt reddit has the capacity or desire to do so as that will heavily cut into their workload and finances (if we &apos;re building stuff up and adding new hardware)
 this fucking subreddit .
 what are you sorting your homepage by ?
 but would that also down vote the one you liked ?
 i can &apos;t believe how many ways y &apos;all can say the exact same thing in different words
 most subs meant to mock other subs have a no-participation rule .
 which is brigading ,  right ?
 like that &apos;s what gets subs shut down
 isn &apos;t that against reddit rules ?
 isn &apos;t that against another reddit rule ?
 yeah but if you don´t agree with it you often don´t want it to trend , be seen ,  etc .
 which the upvote button is more or less for
 an upvote is not an agree button .
 i know that &apos;s how it &apos;s commonly used but it &apos;s supposed to be for something you want to trend (whether you like it or not) or something you think is quality content .
 i &apos;ve upvoted plenty of things i disagree with .
  that could be problematic .
  i wonder if it would be possible to set the feature for individual posts ,  perhaps by way of a flair .
 np links were ever official .
 and the reddit admins don &apos;t care about what links you use
 don &apos;t those all use np links though ?
 lmao he just wanted free karma
 wait ,  so people actually thinks on reddit ?
 the toggle idea is pretty good .
 mods can toggle it on when the sub isn &apos;t  satirical and off on subs that are .
 probably why he asked for other opinions dude
 sprog is still active !
 i saw a fresh poem yesterday !
 things aren’t the same as they once were .
 earlier today i was on a sub where a guy had broken both his arms ,  and nobody had made any jokes about his mom yet .
 /u/andromeda321 is kinda like the astronomy unidan
 what about vargas ?
 she’s still active right ?
 poem for your sprog is still around
 i see poem here and there ,  but they just aren &apos;t what they used to be .
 a quick 8 or hot 16 sometimes ,  even some non-standard signatures ,  but never more than 3-4 stanzas .
 i’ve thought about that and feel unidan’s weakness was their notoriety .
 i have a feeling similar accounts exist to this day but perhaps keep a low profile to be easier to monetize .
 whoa that was weird .
 an old response to a shitty comment came up as the first part of my response to your comment .
 newish to reddit .
 u/poppincream is one of the best political  commentator of our times .
 also it would flood the front page with identical posts that are all just crossposts of each other .
 yeah ,  but this would help to centralize reddit around advertising and media-friendly content .
 they &apos;re slowly but surely making reddit impotent as a tool for social activism .
 well ,  unless there &apos;s a shooting somewhere .
 then they get out the sirens and warn everyone across the planet to be safe around some specific little point on the entire planet in america .
 make it so you don &apos;t get more karma if you self-xpost .
 not to mention how easy it would be to game the system to get a post to the front page .
 you imply this isn &apos;t already the case .
 it &apos;s easier to just go on a give-me-upvote subreddit ,  of which there are many .
 so then what &apos;s the point of the whole thing ?
 there is a reason we use  .
 cross posting is to get content to subs its relevant in ,  it doesn &apos;t matter who gets the karma .
 it for the crossposter to take .
 yeah there &apos;s a million ways to reference someone &apos;s post without crossposting .
  in your example ,  you would just use another method ,  like take a screenshot .
 right ,  that &apos;s precisely my reaction to this proposal .
 op is essentially suggesting site-enforced brigading: even if it &apos;s upvotes ,  the sudden influx from one sub into another is still very likely to the detriment to the quality/existing community of said sub .
 i have no idea why the other person is still arguing .
 right ,  the way i &apos;ve been thinking about it is ,  subreddits are supposed to be like a self functioning sandboxed community .
 while that isn &apos;t 100% the case since karma is constant across the platform ,  it &apos;s almost true .
 as soon as you bring in something like this ,  the subreddit boundaries mean nothing .
 a niche community is now overcome by the popular opinion of the site as a whole .
 why even have subreddits then ?
 you could literally get a post about breaking bad to the top of some small gaming subreddit .
 that thread convinced me god is dead
 that &apos;s the best worst thing i &apos;ve seen in a while .
 i love how much that poster just missed the point of the kill la kill scene .
 those were interesting days to navigate
  that is an old thread from before i joined reddit so i missed out on it .
  but checking out the profile of the person behind that list ,  it &apos;s a trip .
  i honestly can &apos;t figure out if they &apos;re serious or some kind of novelty account with their fixation ,  but having a seven year old account that never talks about anything but that ?
 that is probably spot on
 let &apos;s stop blaming other platforms for redditors being redditors .
 and they aren &apos;t mutually exclusive anyway .
 a few years back they changed the default home page from a collection for default subreddits to /r/popular .
 i think this probably helped hide the fact that reddit is composed of many distinct ,  smaller communities and encouraged generic participation on all subreddits that newer users come across rather than just the ones they consciously chose to join .
 is this the fault of new reddit or something ?
 pretty good chance it &apos;s the influx of new people from facebook and similar social media sites that don &apos;t understand how reddit works and just want another  &apos;news &apos; feed to scroll by .
 the subreddit known as thedonald .
 yes but i just pulled like 20k upvotes off of him
 this is the response we needed !
 just be careful drew doesn &apos;t put you under his desk !
 how will people know how big my e-penis is ?
 until all points are replaced by banknotes in one day
 where can i cash in my points for all those ho downs then ?
 whose line is it ,  anyway .
 lets move on to a game called props .
 does karma actually do anything ?
  &apos;and if you &apos;re keeping score at home .
 you &apos;re the dumbest person i know .
 alright but cake day
 like a starbucks right across the street from a starbucks .
 but you can sell the account for $$$
 not really rude .
 i just feel bad that i got more upvotes than the original post
 i think crosspost is better than outright downloading the picture and posting it .
 this whole question is meaningless ,  all questions of the type  &apos;how would you feel about xyz &apos; are really irritating since they &apos;ll usually have one generic type of answer upvoted .
 why would they stop ?
  they still get whatever karma their cross post would get .
 plus ,  most of them aren &apos;t cross posting anyways ,  they are uploading and posting it themselves .
  this would just allow them to upload other people &apos;s content ,  and then cross post their own posts and get even more karma .
  would take karmawhoring to a whole different level .
 not that i care much ,  karma is worthless .
  people who chase it tend to just be those who constantly need validation .
  frankly ,  i appreciate reposts and crossposts because i don &apos;t spend my entire life browsing reddit and so often miss out on content unless it &apos;s reposted .
 i &apos;ve seen this question multiple times before .
 i &apos;m so fucking sick of reposts around here but they often go unnoticed because most people unsubscribe when they notice everything is just reposts .
 then new users flood in and answer the reposts because they &apos;ve never seen them before .
 usually sort by  &apos;best &apos; .
  what do you recommend ?
 (for  &apos;new &apos; ,  it does give new stuff ,  of course ,  but there &apos;s so much junk to scroll through ,  i only do that once in a while .
 oh she you right dog my be
 no ,  because ita only liking the crosspost that likes the original ,  but upvoting or downvoting the original will not do the same to every crosspost that exists .
 we need sideways arrows !
 should just make it so to upvote the crosspost and the original post you just double tap the upvote button .
 then you don’t have to go back into the original post if you didn’t want to upvote it
 i would at least undo my upvote tho .
 the same goes for subs meant to showcase posts in other subs though ,  which includes not participating by not upvoting the original post/comment and drowning out the existing community .
 you could also say .
 the vote system has already become an agree/disagree thing ,  instead of its original purpose .
 encouraging people to then go an vote/brigade would be ,  but just linking (especially with np links) is fine .
 i guess you could make the upvote carry through only if it was a non - np  link .
 that rule is to not go out of your way to downvote the posts of a user .
 it doesn &apos;t say anything about going out of your way to downvote a specific post that you didn &apos;t like .
 yeah it is not for agreeing but it is possible that i want sth .
 to not trend but at the same time if others  &apos;make fun of it &apos; ort sth .
 like that i want that to trend .
 i feel menaced by your name .
 or just wanted to ask a question ?
 jeez really assuming the bad side quickly .
 just take a look on /r/topmindsofreddit/ which showcases reddit &apos;s finest thinkers .
 he &apos;s still out there doing his thing .
 there &apos;s a lot of unscrupulous farmers out there though ,  heaven only knows what they do with all their karma .
 i got this ,  but i wish i didn &apos;t got this
 very popular old school poster that had some sort of environmental/science  background .
 i think he mightve been an animal expert .
 any post that had anything to do with animals ,  reddit users would put up the unidan signal and he always seemed to show up and give interesting detailed info on whatever animal people were curious about .
 some guy who posted a lot of animal facts a few years ago .
 eventually he got into an argument about jackdaws and corvids where he was wrong ,  and it was revealed that he was a dick .
 it was also revealed that he used alt accounts to upvote his own content multiple times right after it was posted ,  to give it a boost above other content .
 this was against terms of service ,  and he was banned .
 some say he still stalks the comment threads of reddit ,  upvoting multiple times .
 got caught auto-brigading ,  i think .
 a piece of reddit history
 i actually thought about /u/_vargas_ recently .
 i miss seeing their stories all over at random .
 and i love that we &apos;ve never been 100% sure about their gender because i &apos;ve definitely heard that they &apos;re a woman by some but a man by others .
 they &apos;re slowly but surely making reddit impotent as a tool for social activism .
 isn &apos;t it already ?
  complaining on a contained platform where the primary demographic is people who historically aren &apos;t very politically active and don &apos;t vote isn &apos;t exactly going to bring about change anyway .
 in fact ,  i would say that in many ways the existence of reddit and social media in general has been harmful to political discourse and activism .
  it has made it far easier to look at fringe (and often extreme) political opinions of an opposing group and generalize that to apply to all of them ,  making it very easy to dismiss the entire movement .
  it also encourages a very passive participation in political activism by feeling like you did some good by posting about it online (when bringing about real change requires far more time and effort) .
 or they imply that easily-gamed systems are bad ,  regardless of how many already exist .
 karma for the original poster ,  presumably .
 so that way people can post once and then crosspost it a billion times and it would evolve the karma whore game significantly i guess .
 imaginary internet popularity
 or the even worse option .
 he finds pleasure in all of our pain and suffering .
 starts with g and rhymes with mallowboob .
 would be kick ass if you could trade karma in for reddit gear .
 how did you do that ?
 other than that i really don’t know .
 its just useless internet points that some people are obsessed with
 happy cake day you beautiful bastard .
 the points are still made up and they still don’t matter
 it &apos;s literally the 5th top post on here now .
 the mods need to get off their asses and stop giving people free reign to karma whore on this sub till the end of time .
 i think best is good .
 i wonder if your browser is caching content .
 try doing a shift+refresh to force your browser to load new content the next time you see a stale front page .
 it &apos;s updoots all the way down .
 also it &apos;s downdoots all the way up .
 i accidentally a word
 never ever become a programmer
 it would just mean people would have to make a self-post and link to the thing they are mocking ,  rather than a direct link to it .
 which should avoid it being associated as a crosspost .
 i think fundamentally the premise of the feature assumes that you’re voting on the content of the post ,  and not the post itself .
 that’s the only way this kind of shared vote works: a cross post is an “identical” post because they link to the same thing ,  except that’s not really how crossposting works in reality .
 the feature can’t really work because of this .
 the cross post is itself a new post because it will always add context that changes perspective .
 i’m jumping on this bandwagon
 i &apos;m rightvoting this post !
 there already is one pointing to the right
 snake ,  what have you done !
 downvoted you because it &apos;s so true !
 seriously ,  what &apos;s the original purpose ?
 with most online voting systems i &apos;ve always viewed it as a like/dislike thing and  &apos;good &apos; content (majority of people like it) will be at the top and if you want to see everything then you sort by new .
 what the hell is sth
 but then you &apos;d have people crossposting popular posts to barren subs and getting heaps of upvotes for no effort .
 that’s a complete r/subsithoughtifellfor
 i &apos;d give you heaps of awards but i can &apos;t afford too
 the guy is insane
 karmawhores like me spend our hard-earned karma points on scuba diving lessons .
 gotta learn how to swim coz we &apos;re absolutely drowning in pussy .
 i ain &apos;t bout that life no more .
 i &apos;m quietly and happily retired in a very quiet corner of reddit coz my chainwax couldn &apos;t handle the pussy anymore .
 heaven only knows what they do with all their karma .
 two chicks at once ,  dude
 says the guy with 1 .
 3 million fuckin karma .
 i use it as an excuse to treat myself to something big every 1 million ,  and put something like 50 bucks into a pool for donations/gifts every 100k .
 so here is the thing .
 i tend to think he was full of shit .
 didn &apos;t he have a tendency of claiming to work with whatever animal was being talked about when he replied ?
 oh ,  that’s why i got some really senseless replies on a thread where jackdaws were mentioned !
  i just gave up trying to understand at the time .
 they were obviously quoting but i didn’t get why .
 he wasn &apos;t really wrong ,  but it was a dumb semantics issue that he dragged out unnecessarily .
 he did come back with an alt ,  /u/unidanx ,  but apparently he was just downvoted into oblivion and shat on every time he posted anything so he gave up
 sweet campfire story !
 if i were vargas ,  i &apos;d deliberately mix things up to keep everyone guessing .
 kind of like the pyro in tf2 .
 the theory that i heard was that /u/_vargas_ was multiple individuals sharing an account ,  thus their uncanny ability to be in threads at all hours of the day .
 also ,  holy crap ,  they have 22 years of gold (or “premium” whatevers)
  maybe it will get back to being a media conglomeration site where people have open discussions about topics at hand instead of a propaganda war zone where armchair activists regurgitate the venom of the week at one another .
 does karma on your account even do anything at all ?
 don &apos;t grant karma for self cross posts .
 you have been banned from participating in r/askreddit
 he probably gets pinged directly when his name is used in a post
 nah ,  it &apos;d be like a million karma for a mouse pad and that would put an actual value on all the time i &apos;ve wasted .
  i &apos;d prefer stay ignorant .
 are you fucking kidding me ?
 karma farming is bad enough already
 its a cool idea but in reality would likely just encourage more people to karma whore
 reddit makes money when you get gilded .
 why not get some of the money ?
 like being able to buy things from r/itemshop  ?
 thanks for the tip !
 and it would also prevent brigading if the thing mocked isnt directly linked
 i &apos;m sure he appreciates the notification of you saying you &apos;re not going to give him anything
 he took the pussy off the chainwax
 or two dudes at once ,  chick .
 heaven and karma
 you wouldn’t prefer a nice blue waffle ?
 i miss playing the pyro in tf2 ,  everyone says w+m1 to you though
 vargas is just one dude .
 we hang out at century club .
 he &apos;s pretty cute irl .
 i’m in threads at all hours .
 insomnia is awful ,  i don’t recommend it .
 no - welcome to reddit where the rules are made up ,  and the points don’t matter .
 i personally think this entire premise places far too much weight into karma than is necessary .
 you get a bigger number !
 it raises the sale value of your account ,  if you &apos;re into that sort of thing .
 i don &apos;t think it matters if they &apos;re just farming to sell ,  they &apos;ll just crosspost with an alt and still reap the karma .
 as long it &apos;s one of those mouse pads with built-in boobs .
 i was thinking like 50 , 000 for a t-shirt .
 at least i &apos;d get a sweet reddit bumper sticker .
 i like this comment with your username
 what the hell is karma farming ?
 i &apos;ve never seen this show ,  but this clip has sold me on giving it at least a shot .
 so i guess i &apos;m gonna have to watch silicon valley now because that was the most enjoyable 3-4 minutes of television i &apos;ve seen since .
 fuck ,  idek ,  doesn &apos;t matter ,  point is that shit was peak comedy .
 and don &apos;t forget about the cornbread ,  please !
 god i forgot how great that show was .
 that was a hilarious reference
 thank you for this gift
 only if this comment is upvoted as well
 the second i saw “middle out” ,  i already had the dual handed jerk off playing in my head .
 not disappointed by the link
 thanks ,  yeah i guess i should be more active about my coming election .
 you have my side vote .
 it was doomed from the start
 i &apos;ll give you a notification saying i &apos;ll give you nothing simply because i can &apos;t afford to but with the overall spirit of enjoyment .
 is this what you want ?
 because that &apos;s what that was .
 is that a thing ?
 or two dudes at once ,  dude .
 (i actually have an informal weekly threesome .
 don &apos;t need karma !
 i stand corrected .
 their name is sam garland .
 after the release of their book ,  they did an ama where one user asked their gender .
 they reponded with a poem to the effect of  &apos;who knows ?
 i &apos;m not telling .
  &apos; i am aware of no other sources on their gender ,  so i refer to them with gender-neutral pronouns .
 no ,  sprog said in an ama on r/books that he is in fact a man .
 you mentioned cc .
  now you supper the consequences .
  prepear for your punishment .
  it will be well done .
 karma has just become another way for people to feel validated .
 just as likes on facebook are .
 if it is a good oc ,  and gets a lot of karma ,  it can gain you fame and even money (the whole reason that goose game is popular) .
 there are even some online blogs/sites that take top content and make it an article .
 a man of culture i see
 mine has built-in ass
 it &apos;d be highly exploitable .
 at least the site would be fucked up more .
  &apos;i was repost number 10 today .
 like the name bud !
 reposting stuff over and over to get more karma ,  sometimes to sleep your account
 genuinely fantastic show ,  worth watching
 miller (the actor at the beginning of the clip) left the show a couple years ago .
 the new season has just started .
 i highly recommend it if that clip caught your eye .
 there &apos;s an episode where gilfoyle has an alert blast through the speakers on his computer every time something happens and the alert sound they use is fucking hysterical .
 the timing on the editing/reactions is perfect .
 that may also be the single best scene in the show .
 corn and meal please .
 it &apos;s certainly got worse over the last few years ,  it &apos;s gone from if your arguing with somebody they will typically not vote on your comments as long as you aren &apos;t trolling ,  to downvotes the moment you disagree .
 if you actually have an interesting point on a topic ,  it &apos;s ironic because downvoting the opposing view means your reply is less likely to be seen .
 a shame ,  it made perfect sense to me .
 you upvoted stuff that was a fit for the sub you were in and/or contributed to the discussion .
 you downvoted stuff that wasn &apos;t a fit for the sub or didn &apos;t contribute or silly off topic memes etc .
 but people misuse it so unpopular opinions (which actually make for the most engaging discussion) get buried ,  popular opinions go round and round in an echo chamber ,  and posts are full of off topic memes and in jokes .
 is this what you wanted people ?
 because you created it .
 why even mention giving  &apos;heaps of awards &apos; then ,  rather than just saying you appreciate the post or just upvoting ?
 only after you put the pussy in the chainwax yo
 seems like everyone there was on mutual grounds of understanding .
 no ball shredding ,  dick flipping nonsene to behold .
 damn he was being a jackass in there .
 trying to wave his big dick of knowledge around ,  against someone who was technically not incorrect .
 thanks for that .
 also the really cringey edits when something blows up .
 edit thanx for the 3 karma omg i had no idea this would get so big i love you reddit
 karma associated with a post will determine its placing on the front page .
 likes on facebook determine how many more people see something due to facebook &apos;s algorithm .
 account karma on reddit does absolutely nothing .
 ah ,  culture ,  like dairy .
 i’d prefer to feel the culture in that mousepad ,  but seeing it would be ok too .
 to answer your question: yes ,  it would be highly controversial .
 people are already karma whoring at maximum capacity .
  &apos;i was repost number 10 today &apos;
 i understand how people karma farm ,  but what &apos;s the point ?
 they aren &apos;t redeemable or count for anything ?
 i have some support out there ,  that’s for sure .
 i mean there is precedence of a vegetable in office ,  too .
 he should have just said ,   &apos;i am rewarding your comment by not giving it silver &apos; .
 i &apos;d rather get the reddit silver image than a comment saying they would give me actual reddit silver/gold/plat .
 fucking useless comments .
  &apos;i &apos;d give you a ferrari but i don &apos;t even have rent money .
 yeah hes just gotta pm you the pussy on the chainwax
 his demise came later .
 this post was his claim to fame .
 he got ousted from the reddit community because he started creating alternative accounts and upvoting his own posts to farm karma ,  i believe at a point even botting ,  if i recall correctly .
 he would also use those alts to argue with people who disagreed with him or said bad things about his main account .
 people found out and got really upset with him ,  understandably .
 that came years later after he became the beloved residential biologist expert of reddit .
 he was one of reddit &apos;s first reddit celebrities; personalities known and beloved by large swaths of the community .
 again ,  this is all from the top of my head .
 i dont get it either ,  sure ,  he might come a little too strong ,  bur after all ,  that were _his_ grounds ,  that was his jam ,  but being honest ,  i was expecting his comments to be downvoted ,  because a comment like that nowadays would be ,  or at least it seems like it
 i only recognize well-earned upvotes as legitimate .
 you can sell accounts to advertisers .
 i have a friend that actually made a great living building instagram profiles and selling .
 they delete the pictures and change the name to whatever they’re selling .
 for some reason ,  reddit cannot be reached when loading the area you were at previously ,  and thus something went wrong with the scrolling back .
 just don &apos;t panic !
 can i post this question next week ?
 mum said it’s my turn .
 found this after accidentally losing my place and starting at the top .
 give me my place back ,  reddit !
 laughs in apollo
 how would you feel about this question being asked again ,  just formatted differently ?
 why am i seeing this post for at least a third time
  &apos;specially when i &apos;m down 500 pages from top of all after about 4 days of grinding it that far only to lose it all from an accidental computer shut down
 why does this get upvoted in r/askreddit ?
 it &apos;s something that everyone would either very much like to have ,  or would not mind having .
 no point in asking these questions here imo
 is this the groundhog day or something ?
 reddit is fun has had this feature for a while now .
 it &apos;s quite nice .
 how would you feel about this question finally being banned ?
 how would you feel if these stupid types of questions were banned .
 you wouldn &apos;t be able to farm your sweet karma .
 for fucks sake stop asking this damn question .
 it doesn &apos;t even belong in this sub
 rif and baconreader have this function
 i don &apos;t ever lose my scrolling place .
 for me the issue is i see a title i want to click just as i &apos;m navigating away and hitting the back button reloads the listing and it &apos;s gone .
 then the reddit search obviously can &apos;t find the post and it &apos;s too early to search for it with google .
 how would you feel about a “stop reposting the same fucking questions” button for reddit
 this question again  ?
 karma farming at its finest
 anyone else get so depressed when the page closes and you know you can never go back ?
 sync has this feature
 how would u feel if a cure for cancer was found ?
 this is why i opt out of/avoid the redesign wherever possible .
 25 submissions per page ,  but my screen resolution &apos;s thankfully tall enough to fit about 12 at a time .
 same way i felt last time i saw this question .
 i didn &apos;t realize it but i had already scrolled so far down that i was at the last time this question was posted and had 30k likes .
 luckily when i clicked back i got a nice fresh version of this question .
 everyone wants this every time this question is posted .
 fuckin do it ,  damn it .
 i would feel better about it if i didn’t read the same fucking askreddit post multiple times a week .
 ffs can you just stop repeating this one
 i &apos;d feel great because it would mean the end to posting this same question every day .
 why are you spending money on this karma whore ?
 i prefer reddit as a rogue-like ,  thanks
 how do you accidently scroll to the top ?
 that takes a lot of finger rolling to be an accident .
 ive seen this damn post three times already
 i can’t count the amount of times i’m 30 minutes deep into scrolling and accidentally high tail it to the top .
 that’s my cue to go to sleep 
 this needs to be a feature for apps more than reddit .
 like placing a marker where you are to automatically return to .
 you need to put reddit down .
 tbh losing my spot is the only thing that makes leave reddit and put my phone down sometimes .
 i just have reddit set to hide posts i &apos;ve voted on .
 i &apos;m never more than a few pages in before i refresh for new content .
 how many times are people going to ask this question on this sub ?
  i see it at least twice a week .
 i &apos;d also be pretty good with a way to refresh my feed and have it actually be refreshed (mobile)
 my turn to post this next week .
 it be better than the awful preview comments .
 this ,  this ,  this ,  please this .
 my  &apos;end &apos; button does that .
 it would be nice .
 i would just like it if clicking back on chrome didn &apos;t give me a refreshed page .
 i clicked back because i wanted to go back to where i was .
 instead i get an entirely new page and can &apos;t find the post that caught my eye in the first place .
 what a stupid question ,  who the fuck wouldn &apos;t want this
 no please ,  accidental top scrolling is the only way i can escape some days and actually do real world shit
 it would be a dream come true .
 and it should work if you close the app on the cellphone too .
 like ,  no refreshes on the page ever ,  unless i manually do it .
 na ,  this would ruin the excitment of the experience .
 on the other hand i dont see ,  how this can be done .
 i have learned javascript and i know that reddit works in react and as far as i know ,  there is no such thing that can easyly set a marker to go back to where you have been .
 on the other hand ,  you can change the whole html code with js ,  so if they let an anchor travel with your scrolling ,  it might work .
 i can &apos;t tell you the times i accidentally swiped back from as far down as i was trying show my gf or someone the post .
 how many times is this gonna be posted this week ?
 accidentally returning to the top is often why i get out of bed in the morning .
 as a software developer ,  i &apos;d feel very impressed that they implemented it .
  seems like it would be quite difficult .
 why specify reddit this should be on every site ,  i &apos;m tired of that shit .
 why do we even need a scroll to the top button ?
 all it ever does is get clicked accidentally .
 im willing to bet all my karma ,  that nobody has ever clicked it intentionally .
 if i need to get a fresh page ,  there is a refresh button built into every browser thats ever existed !
 when i accidentally scroll to the top ,  i close the app .
 it would be in reddit &apos;s interests to add this feature .
 rule 3 you dumb cunt
 this has become such an issue in my pathetic life ,  i’ve started watching where my cursor on screen is and making a mental note .
 like okay my cursor is currently directly under my side button .
 when i lose my spot i can at least be in the ballpark .
 what am i doing ?
 once i was home alone around 17(my age) and always looking for something to eat so i thought i &apos;ll deep fry some fries .
 but a match was going on the tv so i totally forgot i had something cooking and it somehow caught fire and till the time i realised our whole kitchen burned down .
 i thought i  was grounded for my whole life .
 when i saw the fire i lost my senses .
 i had to be rescued from my own home .
 fell unconscious just lying down inhaling smoke .
 by the time i got my senses back i was in a hospital .
 i heard my mom crying .
 i thought my parents were gonna kill me after what i had done .
 the doctor let them come in after half an hour and they just hugged me .
 surprisingly i walked away with first-degree burns .
 nothing it took longer than a week .
 plus top-level hospitality i got .
 yes and yes and yes
 that &apos;d be useful ,  but i feel like a  &apos;scroll to my reply &apos; button would be much more useful for me ,  at least .
 i always accidentally reload and spend 2 hours looking for my reply-
 gimmie gimmie gimmie
 why is this a question ?
 why would anyone not like this feature ?
 i wouldn’t care at all .
 i don’t care about anything .
 nobody gives a fuck
 what do you mean “how would you feel ?
 ” - i know you just ripped the wording from the last person who posted this exact question but this is fucking dumb .
 of course it would be convenient ,  but what is there to even discuss ,  let alone “feel” about it ?
 how would you feel if you shut the fuck up instead ?
 i can &apos;t believe this ancient repost got more than 100k upvotes .
 would be helpful ,  but i have noticed reddit will scroll to the top anytime i see a post about what didn &apos;t happen in tiananmen square
 i &apos;d never get off if i didn &apos;t occasionally lose my place ,  so i hate this idea
 i would feel like i would get lost in a subreddit after hitting it just once accidentally and then messing up trying to get back to where i actually wanted to be initially
 i would love that
 my app would crash
 undo my mistakes
 just make it damn
 i don’t mind too much as i usually collapse a thread after reading it .
 but i wouldn’t mind the button
 my number one missing feature
 it would be the savior of my soul
 just dont accidentally scroll to the top .
 yes that would be perfect .
 oh my god please !
 shut up and take my money
 oh dear god yes !
 this has been asked many ,  many times .
 but yeah ,  it would be nice .
 i &apos;d love this ,  especially the reddit mobile app on my phone loves to take me back to the top after hitting back from being in a post
 assume that i don &apos;t do anything accidentally and stop trying to control me .
 i don &apos;t have the attention span for that .
 i just refresh and move on .
 tumblr has this and while it sometimes malfunctions because tumblr ,  its definitely a lifesaver and would be much appreciated here .
 i would have an orgasm every .
 i would be all for this !
 i &apos;d actually love that
 i &apos;ve done this so many times !
 take pity ,  give me the button .
 i just want a  &apos;stop random comments from inside the thread popping up while scrolling &apos; button
 take my money and run .
 i would use reddit more than i do because when that happens i just move on to youtube lol
 i’d be happy if it even took me back to where i was after opening a post .
 there is no  &apos;back &apos; to go back to ,  though .
 it &apos;s a constantly changing feed based on upvotes ,  new posts ,  viewing settings ,  etc .
 it &apos;s not like static pages of a book where you can just flip back to where you left off .
 your feed is a timeline-esque section of posts at a point in time (which is constantly changing) ,  so pagination can &apos;t really be applied in a traditional sense
 i think all apps should have this ,  it would make life so much easier
 i would feel liberated as fuck .
 it was needed about a year ago .
 i get off reddit when that happens lmao
 would be one of my most pressed buttons on reddit .
 as good as i would feel if this question was never asked again .
 the hero we need ,  not the one we deserve .
 it would definitely be a payed for option
 frankly this is the worst idea ever and shouldn &apos;t be implemented to reddit .
 yea it’s not fun after i’ve scrolled through around 3 days of feed and then suddenly it’s gone
 rightclick and open a new tap makes things easier .
 instead ,  could i have the option to remove the header from half of my screen on mobile when i’m scrolling back up ?
 i bounce back to the top randomly far too often .
 every time i hand my phone to my boyfriend to show him a post ,  he scrolls up to the top before he sees it .
 losing my place is the only thing that gets me off reddit late at night .
 sometimes when i lose my place i interpret it as a sign that its time for me to stop scrolling and go outside or something .
 maybe its for the best we dont have that button
 but not as good as i would feel about a button to scroll down to the next top level comment (scroll past the 100s of replies if i &apos;m not interested) .
 reddit:  &apos;well ,  i don &apos;t want to be the bad guy anymore .
 yes yes yes yes yes yes !
 i want this button !
 for the love of god please
 say what you want about tumblr but at least it has this
 i would &apos;ve used that right when i posted this comment .
 this needs to happen .
 especially when you open reddit for the first time in the day on mobile and you see an interesting post which disappears when the new posts are loaded .
 i would feel like this is an overasked question specifically used for karmawhoring .
 mobile is the worst !
 oh wait what was that ?
 back out please .
 back out please .
 reddit: oh you wanted me to back out and refresh the page ?
 probably the same way i felt about it when i saw this question the other seventeen times .
 get me back to where i am
 please make this reddit devs
 lol the reddit is fun app has this and it is fucking amazing .
 this question again ?
 ok ,  but just tell me .
 what replies in the everloving world do you expect ?
 it’d make too much sense so we’ll never see it
 i actually enjoy reading comments (as awful as that sounds) ,  this would be a welcomed feature .
 this may be the #1 most posted about thing on this sub and they still haven &apos;t given us one 
 sometimes when i back out of a thread and i move down to quickly with my finger the screen spazzes out and goes lime 10 posts away up or down .
 it &apos;s a long haul to get back to where you were .
 hello fellow brother .
 couldn &apos;t help but notice the name ,  almost thought it was me
 or a button to press so that if you have to exit the app for a while ,  then you can come back to the portion of a thread you were at previously .
 mom said it’s my turn to farm karma on r/askreddit
 it’s not even weekly it’s fuckin’ daily
 “hay redditorers ,  how would you feel about my incredible idea of introducing a feature everyone has widely discussed the wanting ?
 updoots on the right !
 next turn it’s your mum
 it &apos;s not just that kind of a problem with reddit ,  ever have a notification on your phone from reddit you go to view the reddit item and regardless of whether you tap back at the bottom of your android phone or tap the arrow at the top of the post ,  it takes you completely out of reddit .
 or the accidental too many backs and it does a refresh ,  not only losing your place in reddit but completely replacing all of the stuff in reddit with the then current information .
 such refresh operations should only be user requested ,  or at the very least an option to prompt you ,  are you sure you want to refresh ,  for those of us that find this happening often enough to be frustrating .
 was about to come comment this too !
 new reddit is basically unusable compared to the old one .
 the only reason they made the changes was to serve more ads .
 i came back to say i lost my spot again
 the apollo app has this features ,  i use it regularly
 most likely not going to happen ,  forcing you to scroll around looking for what you want increases  &apos;user engagement &apos; metrics .
 tech businesses are bonkers for those kind of metrics and will protect them at the cost of user experience/satisfaction until they see a significant drop in dau/mau daily active users/monthly active users .
 of course by then the damage is done and it &apos;s hard to pinpoint the changes that led to the exodous .
 it &apos;s the same reason new reddit is even a thing .
 i work in tech and i &apos;ve seen this pattern before .
 obligatory /r/apolloapp plug .
 used a number of reddit clients on the iphone over the years ,  and apollo is by far my favorite .
 lots of customizability ,  no ads ,  plus the dev seems like an alright dude .
 i came here looking for this comment
 wait ,  is that feature on apollo ?
 i can’t find it .
 anyone swap from rif to apollo and wanna pitch me ?
 i just don &apos;t have a good reason to stop using rif
 apollo ultra gang here .
 fucking best app for any device ever .
 /u/iamthatis is by far the hardest working lone developer i can think of .
 laughs in res extension .
 i just click the  &apos;back &apos; button on my mouse and it takes me right back to exactly where i was .
 also everything is permanently in dark mode .
 laughs in narwhal .
 so i just read why you laughed .
 cries in android
 sync does this too
 how does the feature work ?
 i downloaded apollo and went through settings but didn’t see this option
 can’t sacrifice all the subs i’ve filtered in narwhal .
 reddit is fun has it too
 this question/request gets posted so frequently ,  and every time an apollo comment is voted pretty highly .
 some people just never learn .
 come ,  fellow redditors ,  join us in 2030
 once a week it seems .
 it &apos;s not even an interesting question .
 who would be against such a button ?
 this is like an upvote for feature request .
 button that banishes people to the moon for asking this question  button that takes me back to where i was on reddit
 i think i’d rather have 10 of those famous “sexiest sex ever sexed” questions than this goddamn question every other day .
 op knows damn well how everyone thinks about this
 i was looking for the cynical comment referring to this being an effortless repost .
 ah yes and eventually we will get to another “how do you feel about banning ‘how do you feel about’ posts”
 karma farmers gotta farm .
 i flagged as spam and you can ,  too !
 i fucking hate this kind of question .
  &apos;oh how would you feel if something people very broadly want or agree with ?
  &apos; it &apos;s not a question that gets interesting answers ,  and it &apos;s basically award and karma farming as people give away awards just because they agree
 just curious ,  what brings one to the 500th page of     r/all ,  and what makes it so important to stay there once you get there ?
 better suited to r/ideasfortheadmins
 the exact same thing posted all the time and hits the front page every few months it seems .
 hey op ,  we &apos;re years ahead of you
 the real problem is it always gets to hot .
 among all of the senseless questions in new there is always this one to reach te top .
 i felt the same; who wouldn &apos;t want it ?
  it wouldn &apos;t interfere with those who don &apos;t want it (and again ,  who tf wouldn &apos;t ?
 ) and could only be beneficial to most .
 it’s like asking in the 50s who would want a remote or something .
 idk ,  not a great analogy but not a great question either .
 i felt the same as you .
 because op is a clout chasing karma whore ?
 how would r/askreddit feel about 120 year olds having to pass a medical test to keep their drivers license ?
 yeah ,  i was confused as fuck for a minute .
 i haven &apos;t been on reddit in a few days and this question was on my screen .
 i reloaded to get the current front page and i see this and think something screwy happened .
 idk but i relate to ur username
 two words: karma whore
 dayuum op actually won the bet ,  oh well 126$ &apos;s out of the pocket xd ,  the original post he copied was mine btw
 yeah ,  i dont know why people keep on asking .
 probably not updated reddit since its quite recent .
 heh ,  cant imagine living like them plebs ,  amrite ?
 most apps have the function ,  as does the desktop if you have reddit enhancement suite installed .
 it is a person &apos;s own damn fault if they haven &apos;t looked past the crappy official reddit app .
 didn’t they already ban these questions a couple years ago ?
 did they unban them or has this one just evaded deletion article this point ?
 gotta farm  &apos;em karmas
 especially when there &apos;s already multiple third party reddit apps that already have this feature .
 what &apos;s the function on baconreader ?
 i just do hide read posts .
 or you straight up forget what caught your eyes and just scroll for ages hoping it will catch your eye again .
 the only reason anyone ever clicks back is to go to the same page they were on ,  but you can &apos;t .
 it &apos;s so annoying .
 it &apos;s even worse on yt .
 page closes and you know you can never go back ?
 in a comment thread ?
 there is the scrroll in chrome extension for remembering scroll positions if you return after closing the tab: .
 the extension now auto fetches the last saved scroll position on page load ,  if page has any saved scroll .
 you must have been in a situation wherein you are reading a long article but you don &apos;t have enough time to finish it so you close the tab ,  and the next time you open the article again ,  you have no idea where you left it .
 well not anymore ,  with this extension you can save the scroll position of the page and then revisit the page at any time to continue where you left .
 but if i want to return ,  i usually just control + f find my way back .
 for me personally ,  saving a scroll position isn’t as frequent as saving the existing tabs .
 for that ,  you can use the session buddy chrome extension: .
 session buddy is a session manager that allows you to: .
   save open tabs as collections that can be easily restored later .
 great for freeing up memory and avoiding clutter .
   recover your open tabs after a crash .
   see and manage all open tabs in one place .
   search open tabs and collections to quickly find what you &apos;re looking for .
 the beta version of sync for reddit is the best way to use reddit imo ,  insanely good app .
 as does reddit is fun for android .
 no ,  i hope they don &apos;t just to spite all the people spamming this here .
 tapping the bar at the top of the screen brings you back up to the start of your timeline on mobile .
 this is the way .
 i &apos;m so confused that no one has heard of this .
 i have this when i laying on the side and opening a picture and it switches to landscape mode .
 when i back out ,  it always scrolls like 20 posts up .
 yeah especially when you’ve been scrolling for twenty minutes lol
 sometimes when i’m on pc ,  i drop my mouse like a klutz and the same thing happens
 but mum said i get next week !
 just ask something about sex lol that should get you karma
 i also really hate ,  when on mobile ,  if you are scrolling through the comments and your finger rests on the screen too long ,  or you accidentally press too hard ,  and it collapses the comment thread ,  so then you have to uncollapse the thread and then scroll potentially through dozens of comments to get back to what you were reading .
 so goddamn frustrating .
 sometimes i just say fuck it and lose all interest in the thread because it keeps happening over and over and over .
 is there a way to disable it that i’m just too dumb to be aware of ,  or do i just have to deal with it ?
 this reminds me of the issue i have with excel highlighting ranges of columns of cells .
 click the first cell .
 move mouse to highlight last one ,  and slip and click the bar between the cells - go back to the top .
 holy shit ,  you said it .
 it is so frustrating to either count on losing your place or having to open links in separate windows .
 just let me open the link and go back to where the hell i was .
 shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
 how about when i’ve scrolled waaaaay back to find something that my wife texted me but she texts me to ask me if i found it and now i’m back at the beginning ?
  &apos;reddit is fun &apos; app has a temporary  &apos;forward &apos; button that brings you back to your scroll spot if you hit back too far and go to the top .
 i personally don &apos;t care about what &apos;s  &apos;trending &apos; or most recent: i care about being able to read the interesting looking stories on my feed when i come on reddit .
 i have the same frustration on twitter (post disappearing before i can share it because it &apos;s 3 or 4 days old) & youtube (selection of suggested videos changes ,  so i literally have to write down title/channel of everything i want to watch ,  coz when i &apos;m done with a video ,  the same selection won &apos;t be there ,  anymore .
 i hate that i can have the same page on reddit for hours and it never leaves but i get a notification and exit for just a moment and lose a thread i was interested in .
 and even worse ,  half the time the post you were looking for completely disappears from the whole site .
  like you go to the sub and it &apos;s not there ,  and the only way to find it is hope you remember the title and search for it .
 for me it’s accidentally hitting the next top comment double arrow icon and having to scroll back up and find my place
 apparently this is a big thing .
 i &apos;m gonna say why tf are you using lighr mode ?
 holy smokes  batman !
 it’s a perfect 5/7
 i &apos;ll plug sync for any other android users reading this thread ,  solid ui & superior to the  &apos;official &apos; app .
 its got a few funkitudes ,  but its worlds better than anything else i &apos;ve tried .
 i am still salty that i &apos;m expected to even use an app in the first place though .
  i don &apos;t want a fucking app for every website i use ,  the old version of reddit mobile was great until they kept making it progressively worse over time .
 worked with /u/iamthatis outside of reddit .
 can confirm he’s pretty alright .
 how do you like it compared to ad-free baconreader ?
 also an apollo user .
 i keep trying apollo ,  but i just cannot stand the ui compared to the official app
 and now i’m leaving !
 i like how we’re just a cult now .
 i’m embracing it .
 sent from apollo ultra
 double tap the header after fucking up your scroll .
 i have misinformed- single tap to go to the top another single tap to unfuck your scroll and go back .
 i’ve got an iphone and i can’t get this to work .
 what am i doing wrong ?
 honestly ,  the only annoying thing about rif is that i can &apos;t buy or give awards .
 but i certainly wouldn &apos;t trade that feature for not having my forward button !
 plus rif has this too ,  but let &apos;s see what the people say
 i was a die hard alien blue user and resisted for as long as i can .
 i considered ab the best and it doesn’t even hold a candle to apollo
 dunno what rif is honestly but apollo easily allows for swapping accounts ,  filtering subs ,  creating a list of favorite subs .
 gestures to up/downvote ,  reply ,  save ,  hide posts .
 works well enough for basic moderator tasks if that &apos;s a thing too .
 good playback and seamless support of multiple image hosts and video hosts .
 you can set things like  &apos;upvote a post when i save it &apos; .
 honestly one of the best apps i &apos;ve ever used ,  not just reddit apps .
 ios only from what i know though .
 i &apos;d love to try apollo if it ever came to android .
 i &apos;m looking at this post thinking everyone is a certified idiot .
 is res not common sense these days ?
 res is what made reddit usable way back in the day .
 to the point that i don’t know if reddit would have survived it hadn’t been an option .
 apollo happens to allow system dark mode ,  pure black dark mode ,  and purer back dark mode .
 and you can leave it always on ,  or follow your phone when it switches .
 rif (reddit is fun but they had to change the name when the official app came out) also does this .
 rif and sync are both great .
 relay doesn &apos;t have this but it does have a big red button that you tap to hide already seen posts so you &apos;ve always got fresh content .
 and it isn &apos;t really easy to accidentally refresh .
 sync has had this feature for a long time .
 best reddit app also in my opinion .
 all of the main android apps are significantly better than apollo in my experience .
 there is a real paucity of good reddit apps on iphone .
 all the third party reddit apps are much better than the official ,  a d arguably better than apolo ,  so theres no better platform for reddit than android .
 other than web browser with res ,  of course .
 if you tap the header to jump back to top ,  just tap it again to return back down to where you were .
 if you’re talking about the “i accidentally tapped the top of the screen and got sent back to the top” screw up ,  you just tap the same area at the top of the screen and it sends you back to where you were .
 gotta whore a karma or two .
 on reddit everyday ,  never seen a post like this before ,  obviously not an original question but i &apos;ve never seen it recently .
 i’ve been on reddit for quite some time and i can honestly say i’ve never seen this question asked .
 i would actually enjoy a feature like that
 this is the first time i &apos;ve ever seen it !
 if reddit were to add an undo button that can go back to where the redditor was ,  when the redditor accidently scrolls to the top ,  what changes do you think it bring to the behavior and screen time of an average reddit and should it be implemented ?
 you weren &apos;t exaggerating in the slightest ,  good god
 and now they deleted their comment of course .
 it’s not a question at all .
 it’ll keep getting reposted until reddit implements it .
 then it’ll occasionally get reposted by bots and people will be like “huh ?
 i think that &apos;s the idea .
 it &apos;s not even a feasible feature request .
 okay ,  so you &apos;d like some sort of browsing tracker ,  to bookmark everywhere you go ?
 for each user on the site ?
 (but not the recently viewed links ,  because we already have that feature and it works .
 on a site that doesn &apos;t have decent video or image hosting ,  that doesn &apos;t have decent mobile viewing options ,  and split the user experience between what was stable ,  but old ,  and the redesign ,  which was supposed to be better looking and is just weird .
 and then there &apos;s the chat features and the live streaming and all the other stuff they keep bolting onto the site .
 heck ,  even the mod tools haven &apos;t been seriously updated to keep pace with the size of the site .
 mods of larger subreddits have to use third party stuff just to help keep track of things in their modqueues .
 instead of adding all these new features ,  can we not just take user feedback ,  roll out one ,  standard reddit that actually plays properly with the official mobile app ,  one that is stable and is designed to load swiftly ,  and one that gives mods the tools they need to help mod a site this big ?
 i swear these kinds of questions were banned for a while ,  weren’t they ?
 specifically because “how would you feel about .
 ” questions were always like this where it was just op pitching an idea no sane person would disagree with for karma .
 the entire format of  &apos;how would you feel about popular idea ?
  &apos; just needs to be banned .
 how about a report button for karma whoring ?
 what kinda 2015 internet lingo are you using .
 you &apos;re supposed to put comparisons like this into an image macro with a modified version of drake &apos;s face nowadays .
 reddit ,  what was the sexiest sex you &apos;ve ever sexed ?
 oh ,  it &apos;s eternal since i &apos;m never scrolling down that subreddit again and i can just imagine what i &apos;ve missed .
 where can i find that option ?
 but this guy is clearly trying to view 4 day old stuff that no one else cared about .
 i mean ,  i gradually get there after 4 days of grinding .
 da da da da (da da da da)
 da da da da da da .
 da da da da da da  .
 da da da dun diddle un diddle un diddle uh da da
 i’m waiting for it to show up in r/unpopularopinion
 yeah but then how would they get 10’s of thousands of upvotes ?
 the admins are already aware that people want it .
  &apos;user feedback &apos; for products this large is pointless .
 it &apos;s not your job to remind professional developers what basic usability is .
 if they haven &apos;t implemented it it &apos;s because they either can &apos;t or don &apos;t want to .
 they are busy with inventing shittier ways to do video .
 and the volume control involves broken glass
 that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
  i &apos;d rather they just ban everybody else but me .
 you just gave me an idea for an askreddit post
 try rif instead of the shitty default app
 nah the mods just suck
 on my previous account i had some of my favourite askreddit posts get removed  and i can &apos;t for the life of me remember why i even saved the post .
 and i don &apos;t rarely save posts so you know it was a good one that is now lost in time .
 actually this is similar to me adding videos to my watch later on youtube and seeing it removed or privated : &apos;(
 this thread made me remember that if the axe old .
 reddit layout i &apos;m gone
 it &apos;s probably because i &apos;m/we &apos;re a relatively old-timer/s .
 there was a point several years ago when people were bitching about the algorithm not putting new content on the frontpage .
 this was the simple solution to always have new content .
 you can have up or down votes hide the posts ,  so if you want something to stick around you don &apos;t need both votes hiding posts .
 you could also just hide posts ,  but voting feels quicker to me .
 omg i thought it was just me !
 i also get stupid issues with the top comment not collapsing .
 have to swipe 3 times often to collapse the first comment chain
 bruh ,  do you lift the mouse to click or something ?
 or do you like throw it off the edge of your desk ?
 how the heck do you drop your mouse often ?
 this is how i realize that i’m falling asleep .
 my thumb suddenly collapsing comments and feeling that minor vibration from my device .
 this happens to me a lot more than the going back to the top thing .
 this happens to me more than the scrolling to the top thing
 holy shit that’s the most annoying fucking problem with this app .
 this one is the worst of them .
 i can handle everything else .
 this ,  is what i cannot .
 this happens to me once in every post ,  nearly .
 must be the fat fingers
 omg that’s so annoying !
 it happens way to often
 lol tried this while halfway through reading this comment and regretted it immediately
 i see someone who needs to try the end ,  home ,  pg up and pg down  buttons on their keyboard .
 even combine them with a button like shift .
 its an ancient solution to an ancient (your) problem
 click the top corner cell ,  scroll down and over to where you need to select ,  then hold shift and click the bottom right cell .
 all the cells in between will be selected
 what &apos;s up with some replies opening in the comment chain when you click and others belonging to a  &apos;continue thread &apos; thing that takes you to another area that holds just those few replies ?
 i don &apos;t understand what makes those special .
 it &apos;s not always a particularly long reply chain either ,  sometimes it &apos;s one more comment !
 pretty funny how that &apos;s what happened to me and i saw this post though .
 it hadn’t switched to dark mode yet .
 but also ,  i didn’t know it was even an option about two months ago .
 well well well ,  if it isn &apos;t the source of all my problems .
 somethings funny i can feel it
 the scale only goes to 7 ,  and it starts at 3 .
 143/10 (i understand the joke i’m just a mathy boi)
 yes apollo is native ios only and made by 1 awesome developer .
 part of why it &apos;s so slick .
 but for android you need another option .
 boost is pretty good .
 react for reddit looks really promising as well ,  but at the moment it &apos;s way too wip for regular use .
 i really hope the dev keeps working on it though ,  because i really like the design .
 it is especially well made if you have full-screen phone with gestures on instead of buttons imo .
 for now i agree with the sync recommendation though .
 this has become such a frustrating problem .
 and the fact that they &apos;re still pretending it &apos;s for a better user experience instead of just admitting they want to mine your data makes it even more infuriating .
 i made the switch from premium baconreader to apollo and i don &apos;t think i could ever go back .
 it &apos;s been a few years so perhaps it &apos;s gotten better since then though
 it takes a while to get used to the swiping ,  but i’ve come to prefer it over anything .
 tap once to go to the top .
 tap again to go back .
 thanks for letting us know .
 i knew it was a feature i just didn’t know how to use it .
 i can’t get it to work .
 still cant figure it out .
 the header as in subreddit title ?
 just opens the text box for me .
 ah perfect thank you !
 you’re using the apollo app instead of the native reddit app ,  right ?
 i like that rif gets rid of the award bullshit ,  it only shows basic gold/silver .
 awards are the dumbest thing to ever be added to reddit
 i haven &apos;t seen the desktop site in years and i really don &apos;t know what all those awards are when people complain about them .
 i see absolutely no reason to use anything other than rif .
 if it ever gets taken down i &apos;m probably just never going to go to reddit again ,  same as facebook and every other social media side out there .
 seems like 90% of these complaints are solved by a simple app .
 honestly ,  the only annoying thing about rif is that i can &apos;t buy or give awards .
 you &apos;re actually selling people on rif there lol
 how do you do it ?
 closest thing i know of is the feature to return to the last subreddit you were looking at if you accidentally hit the back button .
 also cool ios 14 widgets and pip support
 i switched but won’t slander rif at all .
  i liked rif a lot and used to recommend it ,  but apollo is one of the best apps i’ve ever used .
  everything about it is 100% satisfying ,  and when there are bugs the developer is crazy responsive .
 easily allows for swapping accounts ,  filtering subs ,  creating a list of favorite subs .
 good playback and seamless support of multiple image hosts and video hosts .
 not sure about these but they do sound cool: .
 gestures to up/downvote ,  reply ,  save ,  hide posts .
 you can set things like  &apos;upvote a post when i save it &apos; .
 it is ,  but i think most people are talking about mobile .
 the “tap to get to the top” is a feature of the mobile apps ,  not a struggle on desktop .
 rif is a great piece of software ,  i use that more than reading reddit on my pc (with res)  ,  it &apos;s just so good
 18 gifts for them at the moment .
 i don’t know how that’s possible .
 maybe i spend way too much time here but i see it all the time .
 it seems to get a ton of attention so i see why it’s karma whored like crazy .
 well that question seemed like it was actually wondering about the different implications of a button and whether it would do more harm than good .
 meanwhile this is just “upvote to feel validated” .
 til you used to be unable to return to your spot when accidentally scrolling to the top of reddit .
 my parents literally beat into me the value of hard work .
 if you make a mistake you fix it .
 you accidentally go back to the top ?
 stretch that finger and get scrolling ,  son .
 let me sherpa you over the mountainside of my mind
 something went wrong .
 please ,  don &apos;t panic .
 i mean apollo already does it so it’s not impossible .
 honestly that response is quite repetetive too these days ,  it feels like i &apos;m going mad whenever i &apos;m on on askreddit .
 feels like i see the same shit day in and day out .
 time to get a hobby .
 op’s original comment said he was scrolling down 500 posts lol
 hiding posts works well for me .
 read the comments ?
 i don &apos;t need it in my face all day ,  get rid of it and let something new take its place .
 wash and repeat .
 you have to go into the settings on the webpage and check a box .
 it’s called something like “automatically hide posts i’ve voted on”
 like are you sorting by top of all time ?
 there &apos;s nothing good after page 20
 or in r/1940sbattleships
 “unpopular opinion but ,  if you think black people are inferior solely because of the color of their skin then you are a racist !
 it already did like a week ago
 with the watch later thing .
 god i hate that .
 i wish they &apos;d let you at least see the title s you know what was on there .
 i tend to stockpile things to watch later so it &apos;s always stuff i have no chance of remembering
 i will have a look at this in future .
 i normally don’t collapse comments on purpose .
 just when i scroll through them and have my finger on one for too long .
 most people recommend the apollo so for ios user but i can’t get used to the design somehow
 this is also my alert to get off the couch and go on to bed !
 can’t figure which notifications on which account !
 i have to go through all of them .
 then it’s ,  “look at my cat !
 ” i’m like dang it !
 it took me forever to figure out which account to close out the notifications !
 also why the “1 more reply” thing ?
  why can’t i just see the fully expanded version of the thread ?
 new reddit is basically unusable compared to the old one .
 the only reason they made the changes was to serve more ads .
 i’m going to look into if there is a way to fix it and i’ll post an update in my original comment if i find anything
 even just ctrl+shift+arrow keys .
 fun fact: it &apos;s actually  &apos;whale ,  whale ,  whale &apos; !
 the meaning behind the spelling is essentially: you say whale three times ,  a whale appears ,  and it takes care of business like a mf big ass whale .
 something something with rice .
 likely somebody turned into a pickle .
 not to exceed 6 ,  but no less than 3 .
 rif gang where you at
 its only a better experience because once they released the app they made the mobile website as trash as they could lol
 it &apos;s pretty much the same as it ever was ,  so i guess i &apos;ll have to give apollo a shot !
 good looking out .
 it’s kind of a hidden one .
 app has sooo many features it’s hard to know if you’re using them all .
 very top of your screen in themiddle
 like ,  where the screen meets the phone .
 i am literally tapping my speaker on the iphone x
 in ye olde reddit days there was only gold to award .
 “reddit silver” was just a jpeg meme .
  i don &apos;t need to see 123827 different 16px images ,  they add literally nothing for me .
 apollo can turn all of those off ,  as well as other stuff like subreddit icons ,  flair and such .
 plus a lot of customization how posts ,  buttons etc display and are organized .
 if it ever gets taken down i &apos;m probably just never going to go to reddit again .
 you wouldn’t even give other apps a go ?
 there’s a lot of visible love showered upon apps like apollo ,  baconreader ,  narwhal ,  relay ,  sync and more .
 apollo and narwhal are ios only ,  relay is android only ,  baconreader and sync are both .
 it &apos;s worth a try i think ,  the app is just so intuitive to me .
 its my turn next week .
 and 1 for you if it makes ya feel better .
 as soon as i was done posting my comment it jumped to 306 .
 edit3: 318 ,  like wtf people .
 or maybe i just don &apos;t spend enough time here .
 that &apos;s probably it .
 people who used reddit before you could go back where you stopped ,  how was it ?
 til you can &apos;t return to your spot if you accidentally scrolled to the top of reddit .
 hey wait a minute .
 yeah you tell em
 the reddit is fun app already has this feature on mobile .
 if you accidentally hit the back button it has a  &apos;forward &apos; button pop up automatically .
 my hobbies involve going on reddit to ask for advice !
 a vicious cycle .
 i have been using this website for something like 8 years and i have been doing this by manually hiding posts after reading them or getting annoyed after seeing them too many times .
 i’ve got a punt i would like to give you .
 will probably end up in r/fucknazeem
 currently with 7 members and 101 online !
 “ok this will get downvoted but imo apples are usually red but can also be green or even yellow .
 i think black people are inferior solely because of the color of their skin ,  i am racist .
 this is a little more r/unpopularopinion .
 i agree ,  they should at least leave the titles of the videos that are privated ,  because then you could do another search and possibly find that same video that’s not privated .
 i especially hate when it happens to videos that i’ve saved in my favorites .
 i’d really like to know which videos i really like ,  are missing .
 even worse is when it shows more replies .
 but once it &apos;s pressed disappears .
 but could be my app .
 i have the same problem ,  except half the time when i click the button it just disappears .
 i wanted to read the comment thread that &apos;s supposedly there ,  if there &apos;s nothing there then why leave that button there ?
 funnily enough ,  same for me too
 this is my favorite fun fact .
 geez ,  that post was six years ago ,  now .
 i was here for that !
 funniest shit i’ve ever seen
 we got ya back .
 the only real answer
 i’ve been using apollo for as long as my reddit account has existed .
 i just learned a few weeks ago about the translate feature lmao  .
 tap the three dots on a message in another language and an option will pop up to translate
 doesnt work for me .
 i get it now ,  its above the subreddit name but single tapping works to get to top but no matter how i tap it wont go down again .
 for me tapping multiple times breaks this completely ,  it only works if i wait a second and press again .
 thanks ,  good to know !
 i already called dibs .
 but i did it in a thread you don’t go to ,  so don’t try looking into it .
 i mean blizzard .
 fuck i &apos;m high rn
 omg it’s fuckin real ?
 i love that this exists
 on mobile ,  why tf like every third click or upvote does reddit immediately go to a screen reading something like ,   &apos;welcome back to reddit you are still logged in &apos; but then it completely redirects me to reddit all or the main page of some other sub .
 that and not allowing comment to be entered after typing it .
 must copy ,  refresh page ,  find place ,  paste ,  and try again .
  seriously fackin shatty ui .
  &apos; ,  i don &apos;t want the gd app !
 edit 2: holy butt f ,  private shit stack !
 the op has like twenty-four golds or other awards and 68 , 000 upvotes at this point .
 anyone want to make a prop bet that the owners of reddit will never see nor make any improvements mentioned in this thread ?
 i hate that so much .
 i &apos;ll get all deep into a conversation and be excited that there &apos;s 16 more replies .
 poofs into the void .
 nah mine does that too .
 then it &apos;ll have another  &apos;4 more replies &apos; and i &apos;ll click that and those disappear .
 and then  &apos;1 more reply &apos; tap nothing .
 sometimes i &apos;ll be rewarded with actual replies and i feel like a real winner .
 mine does that too !
 this happens to me as well .
  the mobile app sucks .
 this happens to me all the time  .
  “eight more replies” oh cool ,  this is a really interesting thread .
  “just kidding ,  hide”
 you want funny ,  bro ?
 that &apos;s how everyone got here .
 i also lost my place .
 it doesn &apos;t sound right but i don &apos;t know enough about whales to dispute it
 i can finally go to r/de and r/ich_iel ?
 edit i still cant read german pictures but the comments are neat
 you &apos;re only supposed to single tap .
 i called dibs even before that ,  in an invisible thread so don &apos;t search for it
 of course they won &apos;t make any  &apos;improvements &apos; .
 reddit didn &apos;t use to suck this bad .
 it &apos;s done on purpose to make us download the app .
  or when i get a reply ,  and i click it ,  and it just takes me to the home page of the thread ,  and i can’t even find my post ,  let alone the replies in context .
 it literally did that to this comment .
 i still don &apos;t know where i am .
 it &apos;s just as whale
 don’t look into it though ,  just trust me
 or just learn german !
 just out of curiosity though ,  it seems like you always wanted to be able to read those subs ,  any specific reason why ?
 if you click the three dots on a message in another language it will give you the option to translate it
 go to r/de and long tap a post ,  translate is at the bottom .
 works for comments too !
 just learned about this too and it’s awesome .
 ah well i wasn’t aware it was in that update
 i called dibs on a dibs ,  triple stamp no erasy .
 the app has the same issues .
 that &apos;s exactly my guess as well .
  but they can &apos;t make me download the app .
  it sucks ,  but it &apos;s still fun enough and i can read and find laughs all day if i want .
  i &apos;m very stubborn ,  and most apps suck even worse than mobile or full versions ,  suck too much data ,  and have reduced features .
 the app isn’t better
 the app is even worse .
 it’s a pain in the arse getting back to your own posts and comments and i’m going to have to switch off all notifications because it keeps pushing ‘trending’ posts from a deeply stupid covid denial sub .
  and that is done to slurp up all our data so they can sell it .
 nah i was goofin ,  they &apos;re just the most common non-english subs i see on r/all
 i recommend reading the update notes when they come out !
 they might be long but stuff like that is included .
 christian likes people to use his new features after all !
 you cant triple stamp and double stamp !
 you cant triple stamp and double stamp !
 ahh ,  that explains it ,  i was just wondering how these subs would be of particular interest to non-german speakers xd
 not only did this man create an empire that almost everyone loves ,  but he was a genuine man who just loved to see people smile .
 i had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy .
  he loved to joke with those around him ,  and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could .
 i remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him ,  but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him .
 a wicked grin on his face the whole time .
 or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves  &apos;what i didn &apos;t hear you !
  &apos; untill they had repeated themselves four times ,  witnessing that initially made me sad ,  thinking his hearing was poor ,  until he looks at me with that same grin and winks .
 my time with him was short ,  but i &apos;m so glad i got it ,  this man changed my life before i even met him ,  and he made a huge impact when i did as well .
 was really hoping he &apos;d get to see avengers 4 ,  but at least he did get to see and interact with his creations on the big screen .
 his wife passed away not too long ago ,  too .
 it must have been lonely to all of a sudden be without his life partner .
 he was the highest grossing actor of all time if you include cameos and supporting actors !
 seriously ,  there was a thread in here i was reading earlier on today about who you can’t believe is still alive and someone mentioned stan lee .
 i &apos;m 40+ years of age .
 when i was growing up ,  all the marvel comics i read featured stan &apos;s soapbox ,  a short column where he would write about whatever was on his mind .
 it was like a personal letter every month ,  and always did such a good job of welcoming all into this little club of misfits and weirdos .
 stan is different than most of my heroes in that when i think of him ,  i &apos;m always 13 again .
 i guess over the next few years we will see how many future cameos were filmed early .
 it will be nice to still see him and know that there is more to look forward to
 good bye to a great mind .
 between him and hawking it &apos;s been a terrible year .
 both changed the world in their own ways .
 since i grew up with superheroes and their ideas of morals ,  protecting the innocent ,  ect .
 i feel like it really shaped me morally ,  and gave me an interest in criminology and upholding the law .
 this sounds pretty stereotypical ,  but it means a lot to me .
 i grew up in a family with two alcoholic parents and likely abuse-related early onset mental illness .
 my reality was incredibly bleak from a very young age .
 one day ,  i got my hands on an anthology of the original amazing spiderman comics .
 every morning and every night when i got home from school i cracked open that anthology and read each and every comic again and again and again .
 stan lee gave me a healthy escape to a world where all loose ends tied up nicely ,  where the bad guys always lost ,  where i knew i was safe .
 rest in peace mr .
 thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me and the likely tens of  thousands like me .
 i &apos;ll repeat in what i said in another thread but shortly .
 he used his platform for selfless purposes and he always stood up for the minority in the face of bigotry .
 captain america fought nazi &apos;s ,  iron man was an alcoholic war vet ,  the x-men represented those who had been misunderstood and cast out by society and it &apos;s all too alienating standards .
 power man a black man whose skin was his power defended harlem .
 rest in peace stan lee !
 you were awesome !
 damn one last cameo in endgame made me cry .
 rip to a real one
 mods ,  can we please ban those  &apos;who is still alive &apos; posts ?
 this tragedy could have been avoided
 i hope the children who fought and bickered over his money don &apos;t see a dime .
 i was a high school senior at a college preparation workshop .
 the instructor presented a quick essay prompt:  &apos;write about who you are .
  &apos; having been amazed and greatly inspired by the very first mcu movie just recently ,  i pulled off the top of my head ,   &apos;i am .
  &apos; this went on to become the basis of my admissions essay ,  and i owe my choice to pursue a career in engineering to tony stark .
 thank you stan lee .
 i always loved superheroes ,  and my childhood was filled with marvel .
 spider-man was always my favorite ,  because i was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating .
 i loved him more as i grew up ,  because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles .
 quick with jokes to cover insecurities .
 a deep love of science that shaped everything i did .
 the implicit knowledge that i may not be the strongest ,  or the toughest ,  or the most resilient ,  but that i always had to stand back up .
 intellectually gifted and ,  with it ,  a compulsory ,  driving need to use that to help people .
 it &apos;s why i became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses ,  and then later alzheimer &apos;s disease ,  because i recognized that i had a gift - and so i had a responsibility .
 spider-man is paper and ink ,  but he is an ideal i always have ,  and always will ,  aspire to .
 and the man who helped give me that ideal ,  who shaped so much of my childhood and identity ,  has died ,  and the world is a sadder place .
 thank you ,  stan lee .
 thank you for your heroes and your dreams .
 thank you for helping shape me into the person i am .
 i know it’s “silly” to mourn public figures who you never personally knew ,  and obviously my grief pales in comparison to the grief of his loved ones ,  but this one (and iwata) really got to me .
 i knew stan lee before i knew who the hell he was .
 he was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on n64 when i was a child .
 it wasn’t until years later that i learned it was his voice ,  but even before then i learned the name of stan lee .
 he helped create my favorite superhero ,  spiderman .
 he gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us .
 and he created a character who taught me that i’m not powerless just because i was a kid .
 while it’s easy to write off comic books as a child’s entertainment medium ,  his work really did have a lasting impact on my life ,  and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works .
 i never discuss this outside of my clinical setting ,  but i use the themes and tropes of spider-man in my practice to help clients ,  many of whom are not particularly intellectual ,  understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes .
 thanks to stan ,  i’m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what i’ve come to call “peter parker syndrome .
 ” so ,  even beyond his personal impact on my own life ,  i owe stan lee a great debt .
 his is an influence that will be missed .
 marvel games ,  movies ,  and media at large will simply not be the same without him .
 through the act of creating superheroes ,  stan lee himself became a superhero ,  a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world .
 may he rest in peace ,  but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come .
 since people were asking what “peter parker syndrome” is ,  i’ll copy/paste my response here .
 it’s an allegory i use to illustrate certain themes: .
 it’s how i explain codependency and hero complex to clients .
 i started by introducing spider-man and his real identity .
 i outline to my client that ,  once peter gets his powers ,  he goes all in on being spiderman .
 a running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity ,  and peter parker is the “disguise .
 anyway ,  peter goes all in on being spiderman ,  and it starts to fuck with his life .
 he loses his girlfriend ,  drops out of school/loses his job ,  and loses touch with family .
 but he doesn’t care ,  because he gets to be the hero and that’s what matters most to him .
 time passes ,  and a villain shows up .
 wipes the floor with spiderman .
 then he realizes that the one thing he cares about ,  being the hero ,  he can’t even do anymore .
 in some storylines ,  he gives up and puts away the costume .
 slowly but surely ,  he rebuilds his life .
 he starts dating again ,  re enlists in school/gets a new job ,  starts having hobbies again .
 and for the first time in a long time ,  peter is happy .
 then the villain comes back .
 in the absence of anyone else who can help ,  he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights .
 and what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that ,  in order to be a good spiderman ,  he has to be a good peter parker .
 and when peter suffers ,  so does spiderman .
 i then relate the client’s self care to their “peter parker” and their desire to be there and care for others to their “spiderman , ” to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first .
 a seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around .
 i then have them keep a running tab of how peter parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care .
 stan lee dying is like david attenborough or the queen dying ,  i refuse to believe it &apos;s possible until it is
 i know i’m late to this post but i met him when i was 17 .
 shook his hand and asked him some questions and had a muffin with him .
 he is my hero ,  i didn’t have the most active male role models in my life and i used comics to fill that void .
 i learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone .
 i learnt all about racism at a young age through x-men and i learnt patriotism and to always fight the good fight through captain america .
 of course i learnt weird things like don’t go through space portals or don’t inject yourself with a weird virus as your girlfriend tries to kill you .
 but most importantly i learnt there is others out there like me who also were alone and needed someone .
 i grew up when it was still lame to be a nerd and i was bullied for knowing what the circle in iron mans chest was .
 my first fist fight was over spider-man .
 my first memory of my dad is him reading me west coast avengers .
 to stan lee ,  thank you .
 you helped me grow up and become a much better person then i would of become without you .
 i owe you so much and it hurts i couldn’t give you more than a smile when we met .
 but he called me a true believer .
 so to all the other true believers out there .
 keep believing in yourself and others .
 i love you all !
 i knew it was going to happen eventually ,  given how he was going on in his 90s .
 the man has lived a very fulfilling life .
 he got to see all of his creations come to life through marvel studios .
 he got to play minor roles in them as well .
 spider-man ,  hulk ,  x-men ,  daredevil ,  captain america ,  iron man ,  avengers getting together for the first time ever and many more .
 the man has lived a very creative life and breathed super heroes .
 i &apos;m sad he &apos;s gone ,  but in such a large legacy left behind ,  all of his creative works will live on .
 marvel comics were my childhood and even now are a huge part of my adulthood .
 his amazing stories enthralled me as a kid and continue to inspire me as an adult .
 me and my generation will be forever grateful to this man &apos;s imagination .
 through the genre of superheros he spurred our interest in technology and science ,  opened our eyes to prejudice and bigotry and permeated lessons of morality and basic human decency .
 stan made it a priority that most marvel super heroes also show a degree of vulnerability and also in many cases (x-men ,  spider-man) show them doing the right thing and getting absolutely nothing out of it; peter parker would still be broke and mutants would still be persecuted against .
 this truly is a sad day ,  but given all of the allegations of elder abuse i &apos;m glad he &apos;s at peace now .
 his legend will live on forever .
 rest well true believer .
 you know it &apos;s funny .
 stan lee was a person who brought people together .
 he wasnt just some comic book writer ,  he was thee comic book writer .
 idc if you were a jock , nerd , goth , prep .
 everyone single person knew his name and loved him for what he was able to accomplish in his very long very successful life .
 95 years old still  &apos;acting &apos; ,  still being able to do the things he did with as clear of a mind as his .
 today is a day that we lost not only a very loved person but today we lost the greatest comic book hero ever to live .
 late diagnosed dyslexia and attention deficit disorder meant i could &apos;t read at the age of 8 .
 that is until my mum bought me a stack of marvel comics .
 stan is my hero because if it wasnt for him i would be illiterate .
 my biggest regret in life is that when i met the man i froze and couldn &apos;t tell him this .
 i now teach english .
 they should make stan lee’s birthday a national holiday
 god fucking damn it .
 the queen better stick it out to 2020 .
 his comics were so fucking enjoyable ,  another great loss :(
 i wonder if he already filmed his cameo for avengers 4 and if they will include it still
 lee ,  thank you for being my escape from reality .
 i remember watching x-men cartoons when i was little and being so fascinated by it ,  then i started buying the comics ,  watch the movies ,  and now it &apos;s a big part of who i am .
 a quote you said about x-men was ,   &apos;i wanted them to be different .
 the whole underlying principle of the x-men was to try to be an anti-bigotry story to show there &apos;s good in every person .
  &apos;  you made me believe that hope .
 the world won &apos;t be the same without your incredible presence .
 rest in peace and love .
 god dammit its been 5 months and im still not over it once i see a post about him passing away .
 the guy created characters that served as father figures for kids who didn &apos;t have one in their lives .
 provided pillars of morality and courage for many many people .
 can &apos;t imagine how many people battled depression ,  anxiety and suicidal thoughts by thinking:  &apos;if cap can fight in the name of good and the truth ,  i can make it one more day &apos; .
 thank you stan lee .
 he has a legendary legacy that will live on forever 
 damn ,  i really wanted him to make it to 100 .
 he was born in 1922 .
 ottoman empire exited until 1922 .
 they also just finished building the lincoln memorial in 1922 .
 weimar republic ,  british empire ,  all those were still a thing back in 1922 .
 living to the age of 95 ,  having a hugely successful career and all .
 sounds like he had a great life .
 i was a young gay kid that was bullied all the time .
  the world of comic books were an escape for me .
  many days sitting alone and escaping to the works of stan lee .
  i remember reading a hulk comic ,  where the hulk didn’t care that a character was hiv positive and saved him when no one else would .
  thanks stan lee the characters you created were my friends and heroes when i had none .
 honestly i ,  a large adult male in his 40s ,  almost broke when his cameo came up in spider-verse ,  especially because of why his character shows up and what he says (heroic sacrifices are a weakness of mine) .
 stan lee &apos;s creativity was inspirational to me for as long as i can remember .
 the characters and stories that he had a part in bringing to life have helped in the creation of some of my favorite memories and relationships .
 he was able to live a long ,  prosperous life from what it seemed ,  and i can only hope that his final moments were painless .
 if i had to guess ,  i would think that he is enjoying himself up in the cosmos .
 excelsior ,  and thank you for everything you did stan .
 i remember his wife bursting out during an interview about how he would write poetry to her daily .
 she expressed how good a husband and friend he was to her and i feel it important to not overlook that .
 he encouraged creativity in his fans and to my knowledge never judged anyone over a dislike of their creativity .
 he was just a darn good dude and i &apos;m happy we had him as long as we did .
 stan ,  the heros you imagined may have been only that ,  but you used them to make the world a better place for so many people .
 we miss you already .
 godspeed ,  and thank you .
 the saddest thing about this is hearing the news of those closest to him trying to extort/coerce money from him .
 i didnt read too much of it but its always dissapointing to hear regardless .
 95 is a grand age but he &apos;s also left a lasting impact on comics ,  tv and film .
 couldnt have asked for better really .
 every “f” is a yondu-style ravager firework in the cosmos for stan 
 one day ,  when i was a kid ,  my brother and i walked down the road to the nearest gas station to buy some candy .
 that’s where i saw wizard magazine (#34) for the first time ,  which featured on its cover an illustration of rogue and psylocke of the x-men .
 i was somewhat familiar with batman ,  spider-man ,  and superman ,  but i really didn’t know of any female superheroes (aside from wonder woman ,  who frankly seemed pretty lame to me as a kid) at that time .
 i bought the magazine ,  and for months ,  it was an obsession for me .
 i read it over and over again .
 i started buying comic books ,  drawing characters ,  reading the stories out loud in the voices i imagined each character to have ,  dreaming up new powers and imagining new worlds .
 what i loved about the marvel universe was that there was room for everybody: men ,  women ,  people of different races ,  nationalities ,  ages ,  abilities ,  and backgrounds .
 it made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy .
 i shared my love for comic books with my brother .
 although he struggled in school and teachers couldn’t get him to focus ,  he would pay attention when i read the uncanny x-men to him ,  and when he finally learned to read ,  it was because of comic books .
 thanks to stan lee for showing us that anyone can be a hero .
 stan lee was a cool guy .
 he used to come to my elemenrary school every year during the booknfair and i still have no clue why my midwest school was so special but i know kindergarten til 6th grade he came for 1 day .
 and i met him every time .
 he taught me through his stories/characters to be me .
 to not worry what anyone thinks about me .
 stan lee taught me that being yourself is better then being no one ,  that being yourself is what makes a hero a hero .
 i never met him but i lost a father today .
 stan deserves a funeral procession down the entire length of madison ave .
  ,  ny ,  ny ,  lying in honor in the back of thor’s chariot ,  escorted by spider-man and all of his characters .
 for his singular impact on global culture ,  the entire city should shut down .
 he made my imagination soar .
 i roamed the galaxy with the silver surfer ,  challenged the gods with thor ,  explored the seas with namor and felt the loneliness and isolation of the hulk .
 my dad ,  who &apos;s past sixty now ,  grew up reading stan &apos;s comics ,  and i grew up like many children with a spiderman obsession .
 i remember pretending to be sick so i could stay home and watch my animated spiderman vhs that i got for christmas .
 i &apos;d watched it a thousand times but it was still so worth it to put my head against the radiator to simulate a fever just to vicariously experience that feeling of heroism and fantasy .
 and i &apos;d cough whenever my mum came in to check on me ,  ha .
 it &apos;s just incredible the sheer quantity of dreams which passed from this man &apos;s imagination into the hearts and lives of children and their parents and their grandparents .
 in a very cynical age his creations continue to inspire and capture the greatest parts of the imagination .
 i can &apos;t count how many times i have laid in bed at night and pictured myself alongside his characters .
 what a magnificent legacy .
 it made me sick how much karma grinding was going on over the legends dead body .
 i know i &apos;m late to it but stan lee will always be in my heart god damn it .
 i grew up on his movies .
 reading his comics .
 i hope he’s having fun up there with his creations .
 rest in piece to a truly great man .
 i’ve always liked stan lee’s name .
 it sounds like stanley ,  but isn’t it .
 a nice thing i like to think about is if his name is actually stanley lee ,  and he just calls himself stan for short .
 whether or not his name is actually stan or stanley ,  he will be missed .
 if it wasn’t for his comics ,  i never would ha e picked up a pencil ,  found art ,  fallen in love with drawing  ,  gone to art school ,  which led me to photography which led me to starting my own business .
 he also introduced hard concepts to my young adult self ,  taught me the love of reading and imagination .
 his comics changed my life .
 you die twice ,  once when your heart stops and the second when someone says your name for the last time .
 stan lee will never die and will always be a beacon for what it means to be a real life super hero .
 this is so surreal .
 some people you simply can’t imagine dying .
 i &apos;m by no means a big comicbook fan ,  but i &apos;ve always loved the character of spider-man ,  and the shows and movies he &apos;s been in .
 i know that lee can &apos;t read this ,  but i want him to know that his wonderful writing and beautiful imagination struck a chord with me ,  and still does .
 i didn &apos;t  &apos;meet &apos; him personally ,  but i was front and center at an intimate event in which he and kevin smith had a conversation about  .
 stan lee had so much charisma it was astounding .
 like ,  presidential level charisma .
 we &apos;re one day away from endgame and the last stan lee cameo .
 i will cherish it .
 thank you mister lee for all those superheroes that still and always will have a huge part in our lives .
 according to my footlocker full of old marvel comics that i refuse to throw away (despite my girlfriend &apos;s protests) ,  stan lee was the fucking man .
 his artistic/business prowess in life ensures he &apos;ll continue to touch many young people &apos;s lives for years to come .
 my first sd comicon ,  i ran into him kinda .
 he was being escorted outdoors ,  along the main glass hallway where all the talks were happening .
 it was so hot ,  and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants .
 i couldn &apos;t believe my eyes .
 i was just hanging outside ,  and there he was ,  steady as he goes .
 i yelled at him the only thing i could ,   &apos; i love you stan !
 i didn &apos;t expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (the amazing stan lee) .
 but no ,  with double barrel fingers towards me ,  not missing a beat ,  that firm ,  unmistakable stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years ,  i hear ,   &apos;love you too !
 many years later me and three friends go for a group photo .
 there was a kid before us ,  and stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment .
 once our photo was taken .
 i noticed how smaller he was now ,  not weak ,  but small like my own grandma .
 instead of thanking him ,  i just told him i loved him .
 he didn &apos;t hear me but it didn &apos;t matter .
 out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us ,  stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations .
 stan was the man .
 he never let us down ,  and in his memory i/we should try to be like stan .
 ever moving ,  bending ,  steadfast ,  and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can .
 ffs ,  earlier today i was on that thread of  &apos;who are you suprised is still alive ?
  &apos; and numerous people mentioned stan .
 i lived for saturday morning x-men in the early 90’s .
 thank you stan for whatever you had to do with that .
 the most heartbreaking part of avengers 4 will be the part where they show the words  &apos;rip stan lee &apos; at the end of the movie .
 i am not an expert in any way ,  shape or form when it comes to comics ,  etc .
 my boyfriend told me that stan lee makes cameos in the movies and i remember the first time i recognized him !
 i was so excited .
 95 years of good 
 i &apos;m sitting here in tears .
 i wish there was a way i could say thank you to stan and to marvel .
 a few years ago i was going through a breakup from an abusive shitbag .
 i had completely shut down ,  was failing out of school ,  dropped below 100 lbs and a whole lot more as i was coming to terms with everything .
 i lived next to a boat yard and one day went to jump from the dock .
 i didn &apos;t have the courage to jump .
 i just sat there crying .
 i realized i reached rock bottom .
 that week ,  my friend persuaded me to go see a movie with her .
 it was my first introduction to marvel .
 i managed to dig myself out of a dangerous hole because your movies were an outlet .
 those movies saved me from myself and the self destructive path i was on .
 stan lee and his creations have helped me get through the rough parts of life .
 i used to joke that i would never kill myself because marvel would keep coming up with movies every couple months ,  always giving me a reason to live ,  and that that was “torture” .
 but truly ,  i think without those amazing things he brought to life ,  i would’ve been long dead .
 at least he lived to a good age .
 most people don’t live past 70
 i went to lacc a couple years ago ,  it was the first year it was rebranded as  &apos;stan lee &apos;s la comic con &apos; as opposed to comikaze .
 that &apos;s kind of aside the point though .
 there is no hall h ,  there is no special panel that you wait days to get into .
 they were holding a panel on a stage on the show floor and mr .
 lee came up to say a speech and nice things ,  etc .
 it was cute and funny .
 he wound up forgetting to say his signature word which garnered some disappointment until someone said  &apos;excelsior !
  &apos; everyone laughed and cheered .
 it was one of the most strange things in to hear in real life .
 i regret not taking the few hours to wait and meet him and shake his hand .
 rip stan lee ,  i won &apos;t forget that memory .
 it was a good one .
 ultimate spiderman was the first comic book series i read and the one that made me fall in love with the medium .
 even while my fellow classmates were getting into manga i was searching my local library for ultimate spiderman tpb volumes .
 they always seemed to skip volumes and be missing the end of arcs .
 i remember asking my mom to help me request the missing volumes from other libraries .
 as someone who never got into comics or the culture around them ,  my interests rarely crossed over with his creations ,  but i still always got the impression he was a genuinely nice guy who was super into what he did .
  the world needs more people with that passion ,  enthusiasm and positivity .
  sad to hear he &apos;s passed ,  glad to hear that ,  by all accounts ,  he absolutely filled his life with what he loved .
 i went to dragoncon with a friend in 2010 .
 he had a spider-man issue #4 and had me get stan lee sign it .
 i was also dressed up as princess peach .
 i’ll never forget his words to me .
 “i wouldn’t mind being your grandfather .
 oh you amazing human being .
 we will miss you .
 i hope that in a future mcu movie ,  there is a scene in with the watchers where one of them notes that he is no longer on earth because he was  &apos;promoted .
 i &apos;m for sure gonna ugly cry when i see his cameo in avengers 4 .
 stan lee forever changed the movie industry and the lives of millions of people .
 he made it cool to be a comic book nerd .
 the heroes i &apos;ve always looked up to are now household names .
 i &apos;ll never forget when i saw iron man in theaters for the first time .
 i went with my mom and my younger brother .
 i was wearing a stark industries shirt we bought the day before .
 when tony stark was being tortured my mom made us leave the theater and see a more age appropriate movie ,  kung fu panda .
 i said i had to go to the bathroom and snuck back in to watch the rest of iron man .
 my mom was pissed and i got grounded ,  but i didn &apos;t regret it then and i never will .
 thank you stan for all the memories ,  you will be missed .
 i literally had no friends growing up ,  outside of the ones in my comics .
  the x-men were different ,  so it was ok that i was different .
  the hulk was angry and wanted to be alone ,  so it was ok that i did too .
  spidey always tried to do the right thing ,  even when it bit him in the ass ,  so that &apos;s what i try to do to .
 i &apos;ll press it once because i &apos;m supposed to ,  but only because i dont actually have an appropriate way to tell anyone how important his work actually was to me .
 can we all take a moment to remember and pay respects to the awesome people we lost in 2018 ?
 among these people were: .
 \-stefan karl (forever number one)   .
 \-anthony bourdain (thanks for the fun adventures !
 \-stan lee (a true superhero)   .
 \-john mccain (thank you for your service)   .
 \-stephen hawking (amazing physicist ,  amazing person) .
 i had a thought today that made me feel better about this .
 first of all ,  he lived a long life .
 and in that time ,  he not only created many of the characters we know and love today ,  but he helped turn comics from a niche hobby for  &apos;nerds &apos; (at a time when that was a bad thing to be) ,  to arguably the most mainstream media in entertainment today .
 he got to see his characters truly become household names .
 he had a lot to be proud of and i think he was proud .
 pour one out for the cameo master (better than hitchcock) ,  the story teller ,  and the world builder .
 it was the characters that he helped create that gave me so much entertainment as a child and even now as an adult .
 rest in peace ,  you wonderful man 
 i hope they find a way to work him in some kind of cameo in the future movies .
 i can &apos;t thank stan enough for giving me such great childhood fantasies .
 10/10 would shoot imaginary powers out of my hands again .
 quite sad stan lee was not able to watch avengers: endgame .
 i hope he was able to see some clips at least .
 i’d like to see an end credit sequence in a4 where everyone thanks stan .
 just a simple “thank you for everything”
 chill he just got transferred to another universe
 very few celebrity deaths make me pause .
 you will be missed .
 man ,  i always sad that the day stan lee died would be a fucking tragedy ,  but i never imagined it would be so big .
 i mean ,  this isn &apos;t an actor who played a small part in a single generation &apos;s childhood ,  this man has shaped and led childhoods for generations spanning from the 40 &apos;s to today .
 this is an icon ,  and i look forward to seeing how he will be remembered .
 i just hope what &apos;s left at marvel doesn &apos;t let this man go quietly - stan lee should be remembered as colorfully as he lived through his creations .
 this really sucks .
 i &apos;ve been dreading it for a while ,  i think we all knew it as going to happen soon ,  but hoped a little bit longer would be nice .
 i found an old box of marvel cards i started collecting when i was 15 and kinda forgot about it until a few months ago .
 i &apos;ve been adding to my collection and it &apos;s getting pretty good .
 thank you stan for bringing so much joy in everyone &apos;s life .
 i know a 5 year old girl that &apos;s in love with spider-man ,  it &apos;s adorable .
 rip stan lee ,  you will always be a legend .
 thank you for your creation of the heroes we all came to root for and love .
 hope your next adventure is as exciting as all the adventures you gave us .
 today his cameo as one of the watchers became a reality as he watches us all from above .
 rest in peace stan lee .
 you inspired me in ways i still have yet to understand .
 i’m not the biggest comic book fan but i do have superhero’s i adore and the realization you were truly the man behind the masks hasn’t quite sunk in for me .
 goodbye you visionary .
 thank you for helping kids like me cope with life and it’s complexities through your work .
 off on your next adventure !
 much love stan .
 favorite cameo by far was his appearance in guardians vol .
 2 ,  not for what he appeared as but for what he was talking about .
 i was cracking up as he sort-of broke the 4th wall talking about all of his past cameos in a cameo .
 i came for questions .
 not to get sad .
 it would be so charming if all the actors would get together and film like a 10 minute mini movie where all the characters attend his memorial and pay respects 
 stan lee and those he worked with created the new american mythology that most of us grew up on .
 we may have known about the greek and roman myths ,  but those weren’t the heroes we identified with ,  the ones we knew the origin stories to .
 he created the heroes we indulged ourselves in ,  imagining ourselves in their roles .
 stan lee helped many of us see that even a nerdy kid in high school could get bitten by a radioactive spider ,  not die from radiation poisoning ,  and take on great responsibility .
 or that a group of mutant freaks could walk around in blue & yellow spandex ,  shoot lasers from behind their ruby glasses ,  and still be heroes .
 or that a pansy weakling could get injected with a super serum and beat the shit out of nazis .
 he crafted so many amazing tales and had such a great heart ,  it’s the saddest i’ve ever felt for somebody that i’ve never met ,  but who felt like someone that would always be there .
 i am so sad to see this today .
 lee gave me the most precious gift .
 having grown up a comic-reading tomboy ,  i have watched every marvel movie (except deadpool) with my 12-year-old son ,  starting when he was probably much too young .
 but it’s our “thing .
 ” we see them in the theater ,  just him and me ,  and then over and over again on dvd .
  we talk about who could kick who’s ass and how even heroes are flawed .
 we debate who our favorite hero is (lately ,  it’s cap) and why .
 we speculate wildly about what’s going to happen next - how are they going to undo the snap ?
 what will the next stan lee cameo be ?
 most moms don’t get that many things that they can truly bond with their boys over .
 i stink at video games ,  and he surpassed my soccer skills by age 8 !
 but we have always had marvel .
 lee ,  for creating a world where my boy and i can lose ourselves and find each other .
 thank you for making the world a better - and much more entertaining - place .
 we never did get to meet him ,  but if i had ,  i would have hugged him and thanked him in person .
 i am so sad i will never get the chance .
 unless tahiti really exists .
 it is a magical place .
 stan  &apos;the man &apos; lee was the crown jewel of this earth if you ask me .
 so happy ,  so creative ,  so outgoing ,  so accomplished ,  such a wonderful ,  influential ,  inspirational guy ,  marvel comics ,  and by extension ,  pop culture ,  are his baby .
 i physically can &apos;t imagine a world untouched by his artistic hands ,  nor can i appreciate this one the same way now that he &apos;s not in it .
 entire generations have come and gone with marvel ,  and each and every fanboy and fangirl owes at least something to him .
 all of his characters ,  his fictional families ,  all of his stories will go down as legends ,  if they already haven &apos;t ,  that is .
 he &apos;s been in just about every summer blockbuster this last decade worth caring about ,  and neither comics or cinema will be the same with the reverberating memory of his passing looming over us .
 i think we all know it was bound to happen at some point ,  let &apos;s not kid around ,  but nonetheless i wish he &apos;d at least live to see avengers 4 (or even to see the people &apos;s reaction to just the title alone) .
 he deserved more than this world had to offer ,  and he &apos;ll always be remembered as the best of the best .
 don’t really know how to respond to this question 
 we &apos;ll never forget all the incredible stories you &apos;ve given us .
 you &apos;ve impacted not just a generation ,  but generations to come .
 i have no doubt that stan lee will be on as many lips as steve jobs going down the line .
 you were a true inspiration ,  and i hope you &apos;ve found peace wherever you are now .
 i nearly downvoted this on instinct .
 stan (directly and indirectly) gave us everything .
 he gave us f\\king megazords ,  before power rangers existed .
 he gave me a little ,  awkward adopted boy who never questioned who his parents are/were .
 watchers ,  beyonder ,  god ,  whoever ,  please bless stan lee
 i am sure his cameos will keep appearing ,  but they &apos;ll have to be more creative .
 i would actually be really surprised if the cameos stopped ,  as they would be a perfect way to pay respects for him and to remember him fondly .
  &apos;ya know ,  i guess one person can make a difference .
  &apos;-stan lee ,  spider-man 3 
 his death on the news today made me cry ,  since i was a kid i always wanted to make comics and he was my inspiration ,  i &apos;d check in at my local comic store every few weeks to pick up an avengers comic and read about iron man ,  captain america ,  thor etc .
 today is a sad day ,  not just for me ,  but for the entirety of the marvel community ,  goodbye stan lee ,  you will live on in the hearts of marvel fans wherever they may be from australia to alaska .
 from spiderman blankets ,  bed sheets ,  clothes ,  even underwear ,  i was raised by stan lee &apos;s creations .
 i will never forget you .
 you &apos;ll always live on in my heart ,  and i will never forget how you taught me even the small guys can stand up for something much bigger than themselves .
 i hope you rest in nothing but peace and love .
 goodnight stan ,  many tears will fall in your honor .
 f for a man who deserves so many f &apos;s but never seemed to be bothered by f &apos;s but purely did something he loved
 rest in peace stan lee .
 you will always be remembered .
 my mom used to sell art for marvel and i stayed next to his room every time i went to comic con .
 this is crazy man .
 he was too nice and genuine .
 this just got home 
 fuck sake ,  he was just mentioned in a thread yesterday about people who have surprisingly not died yet
 today’s been really rough for me .
 this doesn’t help .
 i’m a huge fan of his work ,  as are we all .
 i’m even wearing spidey vans right now .
 i just wonder if his last days were comfortable ,  especially considering the awful news that’s been coming out about his living conditions .
 i love your comics .
 you left an amazing legacy .
 marvel movies will never be the same without the cameos of this brilliant hero !
 seeing his cameos was one of the joys when watching marvel‘s movies .
 spiderman is my favorite superhero .
 i was never able to follow comics since i grew up in cuba but i was able to get some here and there .
 i love comics and i recognize the reach and the cultural phenomenon that you created ,  your contributions to the world &apos;s culture are inmense and hard to quantify or put into words .
 you are definitely immortal ,  that &apos;s your super power .
 we ,  your devoted fans ,  will remember you forever and keep your work alive .
 thank you for everything you did ,  and everything you fought for when everyone else was too afraid or thought comics were silly things for kids .
 looking back this is still an oof 
 i got to see stan at c2e2 a few years ago in chicago .
 i thought to myself go see him because who knows how many years he has left .
 fortunately ,  it was a few more .
 during the q&a section of his panel ,  a young kid came up and said he was doing a presentation about stan to his class about stan’s work and life .
 and he asked for a video intro to the presentation .
 and stan could have blown this kid off ,  but said said sure and the kid had a script and everything .
 and stan did the video intro three times for the kid so he would have a good take and a few options .
 we all sat in the audience silent as he did it as not to blow the takes too .
 and i thought ,  goddamn .
 stan really cares about the fans .
 i hope that kid got on a+ on this report .
 it’s that kindheartedness that makes me so happy for everything that stan gave to the fans .
 stan has a hand in creating my most beloved and favorite heroes as well as the world they inhabit .
 i will never forget him for that .
 the whole world won’t now .
 i was fortunate to meet him at a con 4 years ago when he was 91 .
 i wanted to get a photo op with him as opposed to his signature on a comic or something else .
 i just wanted to meet him and have a pic to remember .
 the moment was fast as they usually are for these sorts of things .
 when it was my turn ,  he looked over and smiled at me as i thanked him for his work and how i was honored to meet him .
 we turned and smiled for the picture .
 all in all ,  it was probably a 30 second interaction .
 after the pic he quipped: .
 “well that was quick !
 i laughed and thanked him as i walked out .
 it’s not the most exciting interaction you’ll see posted on here but it’s mine .
 and i won’t ever forget it .
 rest in peace mr .
 stan lee &apos;s characters have been my biggest source of inspiration since i was a kid and are the thing i am passionate about to this day .
 wow just logged in and found this .
 thank you for your work ,  stan .
 have fun over there .
 i had the pleasure of meeting stan lee a few years ago at a vip party at a local con .
 he was a fucking cool man .
 he’s not dead guys ,  just frozen .
 someday he’s gonna captain america the shit out of us .
 af all the celebrities that have passed away in that later months and have provoked a big response from their fans ,  this really hit me and i understand what those fans felt when their beloved personality departed .
 this guy gave me choices to cope with loneliness ,  bullying or just slacking off .
 without the characters he created i wouldn’t be here today .
 seeing tony stark ,  a character who made mistakes and grew from them ,  used snark to hide his problems .
 but still had people who helped and loved him ,  who was still a hero despite his flaws ,  it gave me the courage i needed to reach out and get help .
 the heroes mr lee created or helped create helped me feel strong when i couldn’t feel much at all and i will be forever grateful ,  because they saved my life .
 excelsior ,  mr lee .
 he was a guest at my state &apos;s comic convention a couple years back .
 unfortunately ,  due to his health ,  he was unable to attend .
 however ,  that didn &apos;t stop him from attending his panel .
 he set up a skype call to the convention from his hotel room .
 he was able to answer fans questions and had a smile on his face the whole time .
 how many celebrities do that ?
 stan truly was remarkable .
 when i was very young my grandfather used to baby sit me while my mother would work .
 my grandfather was a german refugee after world war ii and was a young teenager in the 60’s .
 he faced a lot of racism because a lot of the other kids parents had just come back from fighting the germans .
 but in the 60’s when he felt he had no friends he stumbled upon marvel comics ,   they helped make him feel normal ,  he could identify with peter parker being a dorky daggy teenage kid ,  or the the thing having rocks for skin .
 he collected and read all of the first issues and series !
 now fast forward 40 years when my grandfather would babysit me he’d take me to our local comicbook shop buy me a comic and read it to me when we got home !
 my grandfather introduced me to a universe that he loved that stan lee created .
 marvel superheroes have a very special place in my heart from a special place of my childhood !
 this question sucks
 my parents decided to tell me today they’re getting a divorce (i’m 15) and stan lee has always inspired me and let me live the lives i wish i could through all of his stories and movies .
 now that will mean so much more to me .
 this is the worst day of my life .
 edit thanks everyone for all the kindness :)
 he and his wife both died at 95 years of age .
 she was 34 , 850 ,  with stan only lasting 168 days more
 we lost a legend today .
 get ready to see hundreds of images of superheroes crying .
 i never thought of him as an old man ,  he was eternally young at heart ,  he was never embittered by his advancing years; he seemed to laugh in the face of time .
 i &apos;m sure he is alive in an alternate universe .
 sad day ,  man was a legend and a huge shaper of my childhood and imagination .
 i allways was the dc guy more than the marvel guy but damn will i miss him and am i thankfull for his work 
 i thought gods didn &apos;t die .
 the death of a legend .
  but his spirit and awesome stories will live on forever .
 hope they shot a bunch of green screen footage of him so he can be planted into every future movie as a nod to what he gave us !
 he created the world i love today
 rest in peace ,  stan ,  and thank you for all the stories that generations of people got raised on
 his life will be celebrated .
 stan lee helped so many people and will continue to do so long after his passing .
 he &apos;s more of a hero than anyone he &apos;s ever written about .
 mankind should be so lucky to have someone like him be with us for so long .
 rest easy stan lee .
 just imagine ,  your death being an event that people not only mourn over ,  but that people dreaded in advance .
 what a wonderful life this man lead .
 an inspiration to us all .
 gonna miss this old goofy bastard made my childhood 100% better .
 rest easy old friend .
 just ,  hard to get used to .
 stan lee gave me escape from my shitty childhood .
 he gave me friends when i was alone .
 he made me smile when i had nothing else to bring me joy .
 thank you so so much stan lee .
 ive never met the guy personally ,  and i cant say what kind of guy he was ,  but he cared about his work ,  his fans ,  and that i can respect .
 i wasn’t a comic book person but i enjoy many of the cartoons and movies based on his work and those of his colleagues .
 i always loved his cameos on them too he was a brilliant man who brought entertainment to so many and will for the foreseeable future as his work lives on through the ages .
 truly saddened by this .
 my best to his family and friends during this time of loss .
 today we have lost earth &apos;s mightiest hero .
 rip stan lee ,  thanks for keeping me entertained for 22+ years of my life .
 huge fan of your life &apos;s work .
 i &apos;m a huge marvel fan and it warms my heart to see threads about stan lee all across reddit .
 words can &apos;t describe how much respect i had for this man .
 the other side needs you more than we do .
 a sad day for sure ,  shine on you legend
 the thing that fascinates me most is that he could possibly have the biggest celebrity turn out for a funeral ever .
  not even 20 years ago if you said the loss of stan lee would affect that many people you would think that was crazy .
  but here we are .
 rip stan lee ,  one of the best writers and entertainers of our time
 can i get an f in the chat ,  lads ?
 mods: let &apos;s make a megathread to remember stan lee !
 the mod who posted this literally did it for karma rofl this is not relevant to this subreddit at all
 man i love spider-man because of him .
 being 25 ,  i really enjoyed spider-man 2 (2004) as that’s one of my all time favorite movies .
 i loved both spider-man games on ps1 along with spider-man 2 on ps2 .
 played those games for hours upon hours growing up !
 isn’t it just tragic that he didn’t just live to see the conclusion of this ten year mcu story ?
 such a nice guy .
 i ,  by coincidence ,  actually saw a video yesterday about every stan lee cameo ever in every marvel/superhero show/film .
 i never expected him to die the day right after i saw it .
 i mean ,  i didn &apos;t expect him to live much longer obviously ,  as he was 95 .
 i even remember seeing a whole bunch of those cameos ,  even one of them being in the spider-man animated series ,  where spider-man goes to an alternate dimension ,  meets stan and goes web-slinging with stan lee on his back (i saw it as a kid) .
 his movies truly were great (i mean ,  i personally think that the doctor strange final battle was short xd) !
 movie after movie ,  the mcu universe was getting much more interesting .
 movies like black panther ,  thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy (volumes 1 & 2) are good examples of great movies .
 i will miss his originality ,  movies (i mean ,  marvel must continue ,  so i guess there will be more movies) and his cameos .
 so long stan lee ,  rest in peace .
 it &apos;s difficult to overstate the impact that stan lee has had on my life ,  not just as a fan but also as an illustrator .
 he &apos;s written some of the best available books on graphic storytelling .
 i am gutted by his death .
 95 might seem old ,  but what a lot of younger people don &apos;t realize is that while our bodies age as we get older ,  we are still the same people inside as we &apos;ve always been .
 a death at 95 is just as tragic imho as it is at any other time of life .
 you will be sorely missed .
  &apos;we wanted to make this thread to honor and remember this wonderful man ,  so please use it ,  discuss his life ,  his work ,  his cameos ,  ect and what they meant to you .
 the majority of the internet:  &apos;f &apos;
 this may have already been said but i think someone out there should draw the great character of comics be his pallbearers in a one off print .
 the casket of stan lee being carried by spawn (image comics) ,  batman/superman (dc comics) ,  captain america ,  spiderman ,  iron man (marvel) .
 of course that &apos;s my six but you can &apos;t say that wouldn &apos;t be a dope picture .
 it &apos;s the one time everyone in comics could come together to celebrate the life of a great man .
 i don’t feel so good .
 but in all seriousness ,  he has had a big part in shaping me and so many other people with his work and the whole universe he created .
 and what a beautiful and big heart stan must have had as well ,  it seems he really knew the meaning of love .
 he really did create a beautiful life for himself as well together with his wife .
 they  even lived through losing a child few days after delivery and pushed through it together and her support and love is the reason stan didn’t quit writing when he was depressed so she is also the reason why we have the characters we love today .
 a lot of people nowadays give up on loved ones in those situations and don’t value what is really important in life .
 it genuinely looks like they were not only lovers but partners and best friends to each other .
 it’s heartwarming to know that unconditional true love like this exist .
 not many people these days who will one day get at the end of the rope can say that they have been married for 69 years .
 truly beautiful love story they had .
 he must have really missed her in this past year .
 what i’m trying to say is that he did not only shape me with the world he created but he also inspires me with his passion ,  hard work and the way he lived his life .
 he had a long and marvelous life and he will always live on in us and in future generations to come .
 i will truly miss you stan lee .
 thank you for your service for improving uncountable children &apos;s imaginations and giving them something to rely on ,  in times of bereavement ,  estrangement and unspeakable things happened to them in their early lives .
 these children  looked upon spiderman and other characters and saw a hero that they could become ,  how power ensures more responsibility and how to be the better man/woman out of any situation .
 your characters went through the same struggle and hero &apos;s journey that reminded those children who are now adults and will forever be grateful and cherish those memories .
 hoping one day to become the hero that they wanted to be since the childhood .
 thank you stan lee .
 may the god of death embrace you with warm hug .
  may the custodians of the path ,  the two dogs ensure that you have a safe passage .
 so long ,  old friend ,  until we meet at the chinvata bridge  
 a great and influential man that will truly be missed .
 i met him twice at a convention and he seemed to be incredibly and genuinely interested in his fans .
 my thoughts and prayers are with his family and close friends in this trying time .
 creating spider-man was one of the most meaningful things he did in many peoples lives .
 spider-man isn &apos;t a hero that was destined to be one ,  he was just a nerdy kid in high school .
 i believe that he changed many people &apos;s lives by saying that anyone could be a hero .
 do you think they &apos;ll bring him back for avengers 4 ?
 he got to see the his work in the grandest cinematic universe ever made and participate in the universe he created all those years ago .
 i &apos;d say he wasn &apos;t too disappointed ,  it was a good time to go ,  all the way on top .
 to anyone that cares ,  in a my hero academia fanfiction (which is an alternative version of the chisaki arc) stan lee makes a cameo as a retired pro hero that gives a rousing speech to izuku .
 i read it not long after stan &apos;s death .
 it hit very hard on the feels .
 it was awesome .
  &apos;do you not know that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken ?
 rip to both pratchett and lee ,  may you inspire for many generations to come .
 stan ,  thank you for the many smiles and bits of joy that you &apos;ve given us .
 you &apos;ve provided so much entertainment for us all ,  and left a legacy while doing so .
 you &apos;re truly the superhero that every child should aspire to be .
 with all love and f &apos;s from the reddit community and the many fans around the world ,  we hope that you rest in peace .
 we &apos;ll miss you dearly .
 he had a good run ,  his legacy will live on ,  excelsior !
 rest in peace ,  stan .
 rest knowing that we will all cherish your legacy and your kind heart .
 god speed you brilliant man you changed my life for the better and shall be missed dearly god speed
 his contributions to popular culture can not be understated .
 the lives he &apos;s touched directly and indirectly were forever changed .
 now go kick it with the one above all .
 thank you stan for everything you’ve given us .
 your legend will be timeless and unmatched in worth for those who grew up among your works .
 it quite literally hurts my stomach to say ,  rest in peace stan ,  you will be loved and missed unconditionally .
 anyone watch that show where he goes around finding people with  extraordinary abilities and talents irl ?
 i loved that show .
 this is such sad news .
 after his wife died ,  i had a feeling he was soon to follow ,  just hoped it &apos;d be a bit later .
 i &apos;m gonna miss his cameos .
 i know they filmed a few in advance ,  an who knows ,  maybe they 3d scanned him to make some convincing cgi later ,  but finding his cameos always made me laugh .
 best one is from deadpool 1 ,  nobody expects a 90 yo as a strip club bouncer .
 thanks for the many hours of laughter and tears stan .
 the fictional universe you created had so much depth that i could have sworn it was real .
 rip ,  godspeed ,  & thank you very ,  very much for everything stan .
 f to the great bringer of joy ,  been a fan since i was a child grew up on spiderman like any others !
 respect to the man that joined the one above all !
 looking forward to the cameo in heaven .
 rest in peace you magnificent bastard .
 i &apos;ll be honest ,  i was never really into marvel superheroes or any superhero franchise ,  but he really truly was a legendary man .
 he was a hero for many of my friends ,  and his legacy will live on in our childhoods and in those of the future generations .
 rest in peace ,  long live in memory stan lee .
 man ,  just a little while ago i was reading a post talking about him and i absolutely teared up just from that ,  this man is by far the only celebrity that i cared about purely because he was such a wholesome and wonderful person his entire life ,  who created so much joy for millions of people and i hope to send support and good vibes to everyone that had the pleasure to be in his life .
 i met him once at a comic book convention in maybe 1989-1990 .
 i thought it was really neat .
 today i know that it was a blessing .
 he was a badass yesterday ,  imagine him almost three decades ago .
 the first time i have ever felt true sadness from the death of a celebrity .
 stan lee plays a huge part in developing my love for pop culture .
 can &apos;t wait for the cgi stan lee cameos 
 this morning i woke up and heard the terrible news .
 i don’t think i’ve ever been this upset about a celebrity death .
 as a kid i grew up watching the spider-man and x-men cartoons as well as reading any marvel comics i could ,  plus play the video games .
 getting older i’ve been able to go back and read the stories that he himself wrote and they are brilliant .
 it’s really a universe coming to life .
 i never got to meet him ,  but the characters he created left a lasting impression on this nerdy 30 year old .
 rest in peace stan .
 you know ,  i &apos;m not that sad .
 he did such a massive amount of work ,  and his legacy will live on for decades ,  maybe centuries .
 in fact ,  once we leave this planet through extinction or intergalactic travel ,  i &apos;d bet on aliens coming here and finding relics of the heroes he created .
 maybe they &apos;ll believe they &apos;re true ,  if only briefly .
 and now ,  after nearly a century of work ,  he can lay to rest ,  remembered for the legends he created ,  and the legend he was .
 this man created a modern day mythology .
 what an absolute unit .
 thank you ,  stan lee - for everything .
 also ,  you were kind of my wingman .
 i scored a date with my current girlfriend by inviting her to see spider man .
 when we left the theater ,  we pretended to shoot web & soar between buildings in the city of los angeles .
 we named a duck couple  in my neighborhood ,  petey & gwendy .
 they even had baby ducklings .
 she introduced me to spider man blue & i fell in love with her & with the story about about peter parkers first true love .
  &apos;we wanted to make this thread to honor and remember this wonderful man ,  so please use it discuss his life ,  his work ,  his cameos ,  etc and what they meant to you .
 98% of people in this thread:  &apos;f &apos; .
 i really hope they don &apos;t make a cgi stan lee to cameo in the marvel films from now on ,  it just won &apos;t be the same as having him there and distasteful to his memory .
 i think it so strange that there was an askreddit thread the other day about who people think is crazy that they &apos;re still alive .
  stan lee was one of them .
 1 , 000 years from now  this man’s universe will still be known and told .
 legendary human being .
 i raise my glass to you stan for living one hell of an amazing life
 met him at fan expo years ago .
 got his autograph on issue 50 of what if the hulk killed the wolverine .
 the man smiled .
 i will and many across the universe & all the other universes will miss him .
 this man is behind many of my childhood hero &apos;s and villians .
 especially the villians .
 my kids as well .
 he will be missed .
 back in 2014 my wife and i attended pac-con in spokane for our anniversary .
 it was hosted by stan lee and william shatner .
 while we were waking around and enjoying the booths and sights of celebrity voice actors and the such ,  we walked passed a photo booth blocked off by black plastic wrap .
 i looked at my wife and said  &apos;i bet that &apos;s where stan and bill are doing there photos with people .
  &apos;  a few moments later stan walked out of the side of the booth area ,  greeted us and shook our hands .
 it was only a few seconds of interaction ,  but it was well worth the ticket price just to meet him and say hello .
 later my wife damn near hyperventilated when she saw william shatner .
 times that i will never forget .
 stan has impacted so many lives in so many ways ,  and i’m no exception .
 i’ve always loved marvel ,  especially spider-man ,  and long after stan the man steps down from the position of king of cameos ,  his work will continue to inspire me ,  as i hope it will with all of you .
 i’ll never forget the impact he’s had on my life ,  from one of my first video games (spider-man: web of shadows for the ps2 at like age 6 i think) to my newest one (spider-man ps4 in about 2 weeks) ,  from my first comic to my last ,  i’ll never forget my generalissimo .
 because although he’s gone from the world ,  he’s still within all of us .
 it sounds cheesy i know ,  but it’s true .
 he’s the gamma radiation ,  the super soldier serum ,  the shrapnel in our hearts .
 he’s the pym particles we breathe .
 he’s the spider dna in our blood .
 he’s the uncle ben in our dreams .
 stay strong ,  true believers .
 he’d want it that way .
 my dad ,  brother ,  and i would often find a bond in watching mcu movies ,  or superhero and action films in general .
 one of the highlights of the mcu movies is sir stan lee &apos;s cameos .
 all three of us would eagerly wait for his cameos ,  sometimes even re-watching a whole movie just because we forgot which scene he appeared in .
 we are very fond of him .
 there are just no words to express how much i respect this man .
 may he always be remembered for his great deeds and marvellous achievements over his long and fulfilling life .
 i hope that if there is truely a afterlife  that he has been able to peacefully reunite with all the loved ones who had passed before him .
 may be rest in peace .
 just finished endgame .
 today a true legend falls .
 the world will never be the same without .
 i aspire to have a legacy like him .
 may his legend live on forever .
 at least he managed to feature in the super hero movie of the century before he passed .
 teen titans go to the movies .
 stan lee &apos;s work has always been a lighthouse that would help me find the way through the darkest times .
 what has done in life truly will echo through eternity thanks to the many inspired by him .
  you will be miss ,  and always loved ,  stan .
 his stories and characters taught me that people aren &apos;t good or bad ,  that we need to fight for what or who we believe in ,  and that anyone can become a hero .
 marvel has become an important part of who i am ,  and it has touched many others in the same way .
 rest in peace ,  stan .
 you &apos;re a legend .
 pains to read the first sentence of his wikipedia page .
  &apos;was &apos; is a sad word in these kind of situations .
 big respect for the hero who created heroes .
 rest in peace ,  stanley .
 to the man that gave the world superheroes and wasn &apos;t afraid to chase his dreams .
 to the man who made hope for a living .
 you made my fucking childhood .
 i love everything you created !
 what an incredible man .
 he has made so many characters and so many stories that have brought inspiration ,  joy and happiness to so many people .
 it’s such a sad day to see him go .
 may he rest in peace ,  and i hope he’s rockin’ it up there with thor in valhalla .
 gone but never forgotten .
 we &apos;ll miss him .
 for all the drama and fighting going on in comic books today ,  it &apos;s sad that we lost someone who was so loved and so unifying as stan lee .
 f for an absolute legend .
 he will forever be known as one of the most culturally influential people in all of human history .
 truly a legend ,  we &apos;ll miss him .
 i hope they do some sort of  &apos;in memory of stan lee &apos; in the next avenger &apos;s movie .
 thank you stan lee for creating some of my favorite characters and worlds .
  i had a shitty childhood and the amazing art and storytelling of comics helped me escape and invited  me  to dream of a world where i could make a difference .
 i &apos;m super sad but i &apos;m glad he gave us so much .
 thank you for giving us some of the best characters in literature history .
 a new addition has entered the hallowed halls of asgaard .
 i swear ,  this thread &apos;s gonna break the world record of most f &apos;s in one reddit thread .
 not fair man ,  he did so much for the world and touched many people &apos;s lives through his works .
 he &apos;s lived a long and fulfilling life .
 may he rest in peace .
 excelsior ,  you magnificent bastard .
 he was everything this world needed and more .
  and those of us lucky enough to still be here are lucky enough to experience what he gave us .
 thank you stan lee ,  your stories ,  characters and ideas were a huge part of my childhood and you will always be a true hero to me .
 his death actually gave me the same feeling i had when my grandfather died .
 he was a real hero with such a kind work .
 rest in peace and i dearly believe he &apos;s in a far greater place than here .
 rip stan ,  you made comics and characters that have impacted the world !
 gone but not forgotten ,  remembered forever .
 thanks for all you’ve done .
 stan ,  you created great things while on this earth and it will be remembered for lifetimes to come .
 sleep well ,  you deserve it .
 tony stark &apos;s real father just passed away .
 stan ,  thank you for being my hero .
 even with all the heroes you’ve created ,  you’ve always been the one i admire the most .
 i guess one man can make a difference .
 rip stan the man .
 was doing a binge reading of all the spiderman series .
 i was going into a movie theater to watch the new grinch movie when my sister told me about him ,  r .
 p stan  &apos;the man &apos; lee i always wanted to meet you ,  what a shame i never could ,  but i was prepared considering his age and health issues .
 it made me sick how much karma grinding was going on over the legends dead body .
 i know i &apos;m late to it but stan lee will always be in my heart god damn it .
 i still haven’t come to terms with the fact that endgame is going to be his last cameo
 i’m usually not moved by celebrity deaths even if they made an impact on the world .
  as death is a part of life but this one really hits me because stan lee created somethings that every single person and child knows today .
 rest in peace and thank you for being the light-bearer and illuminating imagination in every child’s mind .
 stan had such a huge influence on my world back in the day .
 i’d say the bulk of my morality lessons came not from family ,  community or church ,  but from spider-man .
 indirectly all those things informed me via stan and other later writers ,  but the avenue that really reached me was comics .
 rest well ,  and excelsior .
 stan created my favorite superhero spiderman ,  when i was old enough i got my first tattoo a silhouette of spderman ,  many years later i saw a woman with a spiderman tattoo ,  a few years after that she became my wife .
 thank you stan for making the world a brighter place .
 his comics helped me through some very hard times in my life .
 rest in peace stan ,  you had a great cameo in mallrats
 go in peace ,  you wonderful man .
 as he said in spider-man films: .
  &apos;i guess one man _can_ make a difference !
 this puts a smile on my face .
 many ,  many years ago ,  i got the honor of meeting him at san diego comic con .
 back in the day when it was actually about the comics and not focused on movies ,  tv ,  games ,  etc .
 the line stretched all the way out of the marvel booth and across to the other side of the convention floor .
 he sat there and spoke with every single person in line ,  for as long as they wanted to talk ,  like they were the only person in the world at that moment .
 i put stan lee right up there with mr .
 there will never be another like him .
 he filmed his cameos years in advance just for this situation .
 he &apos;ll be in the next two for sure .
 i &apos;m sure he saw it ,  albeit without completed effects .
 your point still stands ,  it is sad .
 he probably did ,  dont worry
 i &apos;m sure he did .
 not the final ,  theatrical version maybe
 it’s possible to die of a broken heart .
 i hope he passed peacefully ,  at least .
 that and super  &apos;fans &apos; constantly trying to scam him .
 i figured after she died he wouldn &apos;t be too long after .
 usually this happens with couples that are together for so long and grow to be as old as they were
 i would say his wife’s passing ,  and all the crazy lawsuits he’s had for the past year ,  might’ve put him under .
 i know he was battling vision issues ,  and pneumonia ,  but ,  i can’t believe stan is gone .
 the poor guy was truly going through so much .
 the day before the release of spiderman homecoming .
 steve ditko also passed in june of this year
 we approached ,  just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work .
 the handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along .
 he stopped the handlers and said hello to us .
 i got to shake his hand and thank him .
 that story reminds me of this story from the bible:   .
 15 people were also bringing babies to jesus for him to place his hands on them .
 when the disciples saw this ,  they rebuked them .
 16 but jesus called the children to him and said ,  “let the little children come to me ,  and do not hinder them ,  for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these .
 17 truly i tell you ,  anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it .
 he beat out cliff clavin ?
 reminds me of when that guy on r/nostupidquestions killed stephen hawking .
 stephen hawking ,  harper lee ,  stan lee .
 we need to retire these  &apos;who can you not believe is still alive &apos; threads .
 it &apos;s for the good of humanity .
 a couple of years ago there was an ask reddit like that and the person said harper lee .
 news broke 19 minutes later that she had passed away 
 it happened before with harper lee ,  too .
 that was like one of the recurring people that nobody could believe is still alive .
 i remember comments saying they just hope he lives to see justice league .
 doesn &apos;t seem crazy at all ,  dude was old and you lot won &apos;t stop talking about him and how old he was .
 i think one of the best things about him is the fact that people can see themselves in his characters  .
 and that’s something that’s huge in movies .
 he really saved a lot of peoples lives .
 i mean both captain marvel and avengers 4 are in post production and spiderman far from home is mostly filmed ,  it wouldn &apos;t be surprising if they bulk recorded a few for movies already in pre production ,  which would cover up to 2020 if not to 2023
 dude they probably had him stand in front of a green screen and recorded him from 50 different angles while mouthing every vowel and letter sound imaginable ,  with enough editing power they can probably make him recite the entire bible and every episode of doctor who .
 i don &apos;t think they will run out of cameos if they don &apos;t want to .
 my own particular group of nerds gave decided on chi cameos sprinkled in the movies as easter eggs .
 it &apos;ll be a sad day when we watch one without him and realize the one before was his last
 i actually have one too !
 i was working at a convention quite a few years ago as a guest liaison and it by far is one of my favourite memories of working at cons .
 we were told by an organizer that under no circumstance we were to talk to him ,  look at him or acknowledge him – he was far above us as people and as volunteers we (essentially) weren’t worthy .
 the saturday of the con i dropped my guest off at their panel and realized that i hadn’t eaten yet today so headed off to the green room .
 as it was mid afternoon i figured that it was an okay time for me to be in there because most guests either had panels ,  photo ops ,  or were at their tables – so in i went (for context the green room was essentially a giant square with chairs along the edge of the wall and the food on a large table in the middle) .
 i grabbed a plate of grapes and chocolate and plopped down in a chair and muttered something to myself about the con food .
 that’s when i heard paper rustling and who else was across the room sitting in the corner reading a paper but stan lee ,  he looks at me and says “you know ,  the food doesn’t get much better unfortunately .
 but the cheese platter is usually the best bet” .
 i stopped mid grape in my mouth- not so much because i was having a fangirl moment but because of our very very explicit instructions not to speak to him whatsoever .
 i’m assuming that he then thought that i was some crazy fan because i’m not talking or eating ,  so he takes the beat to introduce himself to me as if i didn’t know who he was .
 i decided that at that moment to just say fuck it and talk to him because what would they do fire me ?
 so i introduced myself .
 we had a very short conversation about the weather (it wasn’t very nice – but at least there was no snow) and how it’s hard to find good cup of coffee sometimes (don’t go to tim hortans ,  please there are better ones in my city) .
 then that was it ,  i had to go back and fetch my guest and i didn’t want him to feel like he had to entertain me .
 i thanked him for talking to me and headed out ,  but before i could leave the room he pointed at me and said “just don’t eat the mozzarella” .
 tl;dr - i have a brief conversation with stan lee ,  he &apos;s very nice to me and recommends the cheese platter ,  but not the mozzarella
 i don &apos;t really wanna detract from your story but this made me lol .
 stan lee made a cameo in your life  !
 what a charismatic dude
 fuck yeah ,  these are some hot stories ,  keep em coming  !
 i &apos;m more interested in this dunken donutes place .
  is it chicago &apos;s version of dunkin donuts ,  and is the coffee just as bad ?
 wow was hawking this year ?
 it feels like for ever ago .
 2018 has been a long ass year .
 not to make things much worse but you apparently missed steve ditko passing in june ,  the other great comic book legend 
  the man has been a part of my life and a part of what has shaped my concepts of ethics and morality since i was a child in the 1970 &apos;s .
  more than a man ,  an era has passed today .
 hope things have improved significantly .
 you sound like someone who deserves it .
 and spider-man who was just that ,  a man .
 the prof x/magneto combo intentionally mirroring mlk and malcolm x ,  respectively .
 don &apos;t forget black panther ,  the smart and strong king .
 what is peter parker syndrome ?
 the queen mother died at 101 so if queen elizabeth ii does not live to at least that or even older (i think she will beat it) then i &apos;ll be somewhat surprised .
 prince phillip on the other hand ,  unfortuntely i don &apos;t think he has much longer to live ,  maybe a few more years at best ,  but something is telling me his going to go soon .
 they’ve filmed a bunch of cameos in front a green screen for a backlog .
 he could still be in the marvel movies until 2028 ,  iirc .
 avengers 4 has been in post production for nearly a year at this point ,  you should really wonder about his cameo in spiderman far from home
 my prediction for what &apos;s going to happen in the next movie after he dies is that the post-credit scene will go to the heroes saying  &apos;we did it ,  but .
  &apos; no one will know what ,  shrug ,  and move on .
 fade to  &apos;in memory of stan lee .
 i don &apos;t think they would edit him out of avengers 4 at this point ,  though .
 maybe the op was a reaper trying to work out who they missed
 95 years of nice
 i’m really glad you are still here with us ,  to share kindness and exchange sympathies with internet strangers .
 i’m glad you are in a better place .
 stan’s work also moved me and helped me through tough times ,  specially with his comics in my teenage years .
  &apos;are you tony stank ?
 there &apos;s a lot of good ones ,  but tony mistaking him for larry king in iron man 1 always sticks out ,  especially since stan &apos;s cameos weren &apos;t standard then .
 i like the one in age of ultron where he tries to beat thor in a drinking contest .
 being helped off screen drunkenly mumbling  &apos;excelsior .
  &apos;well ,  the 60 &apos;s were fun ,  but now i &apos;m payin &apos; for it !
  &apos; - from  &apos;ant-man and the wasp .
 on a more sentimental and heartwarming note ,  his cameo from  &apos;spider-man 3 &apos;:  &apos;i guess one person can make a difference .
 shit ,  that last quote literally bought a tear to my eye in light of his passing .
 he was really funny as the annoyed old man in spiderman: homecoming .
 the amazing spider-man with him being a librarian oblivious to lizard and spidey duking it out behind him .
 spider-man 3 ,  “you know ,  i guess one person can make a difference .
 the strip club dj in deadpool .
 the bus driver in infinity war ,  the barber in ragnarok .
 i guess one man really can make a difference .
 stickied posts and comments do not accrue karma .
 i hope he becomes a picture .
 like the picture in a picture in a picture thing .
 have his old cameo playing on a tv in the background of a scene ,  etc .
 i hope they remember you .
 we will ,  definitely !
 saw an article that said his next five cameos are already filmed
 it is kinda fitting to have a cameo in a4 ,  then stop with the cameos .
 a4 is the end of an era for the mcu so why not let him finish with it ?
 it is very sad indeed
 no he didn &apos;t he was gonna see it this weekend .
 i believe this happened to george carlin as well .
 he was always in pretty good health despite his age ,  but he really started to show his age when she passed on .
 this happened to my great-grandmother after my grandmother died .
 her health ,  which was previously superb ,  rapidly deteriorated as she lost the will to live .
 you’re absolutely right .
 i really hated when the press was trying to get a reaction out of stan ,  when his wife died ,  and on how he felt .
 the guy lost his wife of 69-70 years ,  his best friend ,  and everything .
 and the outlets wanted his reactions on what it’s like to lose his wife .
 i’m sorry to go on ,  but ,  i felt it was heartless on the media’s part .
 where ever he is ,  i hope he’s at peace .
 yeah ,  those aren &apos;t fans ,  those are thieves .
 which lawsuits was he in  ?
 so stan lee = god .
 my grandpa was right .
 the top 5 actors who have made the most combined money at the us box office: .
 robert downey ,  jr .
 harrison ford - $4 .
 have a link to the thread ?
 the problem isn &apos;t that these threads are killing people .
 it &apos;s that they &apos;re killing the wrong people .
 personally i would like for him to have that one last really meaningful cameo in avengers 4 as one-above-all and end it there .
 it would be a high send off to his greatness .
 they bulked the last batch that he did .
 that &apos;s why you only see him by himself theoretically ,  only unnamed characters are next to him .
 like the bus or haircut scene .
 one of the coolest moments in my life was when stan lee and spock were having a friendly conversation next to me at a con .
 this was a couple years before nerd stuff really came in vogue and iron man has only just released .
 now they are both gone .
 reminds me of the time i got to see him in person at comic con as well .
 really cool when your childhood hero is actually a decent human being .
 i was wearing a domino cosplay in like 2010 .
 i was also a teenager with dyed blond hair ,  i’m pretty certain he stared right at me lol 
 i love that his appearance in this anecdote sounds like a cameo .
 i read it as  &apos;doo-noots &apos; and lost it
 don &apos;t forget kirby .
  i mean he passed a while ago but he was right there with stan and ditko
 wait ,  ditko only just died ?
 i though he died decades ago .
 that &apos;s what i get for being on vacation and not redditing ,  now i &apos;m worried about what else i missed that week .
 it’s been a long ,  rocky road through addiction and several related deaths ,  psych ward stints and other trouble .
 my life now isn’t even comparable .
 after graduating high school i moved across the country to california ,  got on the right meds ,  made my way into the film industry .
 now i have a long term partner whom i love dearly ,  love my work ,  and fairly recently learned to accept my childhood and forgive my parents .
 we now have a friendly relationship .
 and of course ,  i still live in stan lee’s universe for a little while almost every day :)
 really appreciate stan lee sticking up for us dust people
 he may have been a king .
 but he had to hide his whole nation and im sure in the comics he might have fought a few oil executive type peoples .
 bitch ,  you guessed it
 are you asking what specifically ?
 in general it’s a way to illustrate how boundless selflessness can be detrimental and emphasizes the importance of self care .
 if you want a walkthrough let me know ,  it’ll just take a minute to type up .
 yeah ,  i &apos;m not comfortable with this recent trend of jinxing :(
 i can remember a good few years back the queen turned up to an event in black and everyone started panicking that phillip had died .
 something is telling me his going to go soon .
 the average lifespan for men in the uk is 79 .
 he didn &apos;t appear at the cenotaph memorial on sunday .
 he &apos;s usually there in person .
 i wish him wellness and good health .
 he only shed his mortal skin to become the ultimate avenger .
 they pre-recorded a bunch of his cameos a while back .
 he &apos;ll still be in the next few marvel movies .
 what did it cost ?
 that was iron man 2 .
 lee was playing hefner in im1 .
 the ragnarok one was hilarious too .
 i have a feeling that he filmed more than five .
 i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if he willed the rights to cgi himself as cameos ad infinitum .
 apperently they filmed him for his next 5 cameos ,   so whatever those are ,  they are covered for a while .
 still sad that he &apos;s gone .
 he &apos;s actually sitting in the cinema right now .
 it &apos;s just that nobody can see him .
 george carlin didnt die ,  he became part of the huge gas giant uranus .
 may he forever pass gas
 george carlin didn &apos;t die ,  though .
 the mvp is always found in the comments .
 thanks for the actual medical term you kind stranger .
 i once dated a girl whose grandfather passed during our relationship .
 her perfectly healthy ,  energetic and outgoing grandmother passed just over a week later .
 she just faded away to nothing almost instantly .
 it was fucking heartbreaking to watch .
 i hope wherever stan and his wife are that they are together and happy .
 it’s fairly common; i worry for my grandparents as they’re getting fairly old and they love each other very much .
 i hope at least one lives to see their great-grandchild .
 i don &apos;t like prequel memes .
 they &apos;re coarse and rough and irritating and get everywhere .
  wherever he is ,  he is with his wife leaving an incredible legacy .
 he absolutely stomps everyone else holy shit
 when is this from ?
 downey seems low
 while stan lee tends to be #1 ,  the top 5 varies wildly by source .
 yeah ,  another  &apos;who can &apos;t you believe is still alive &apos; ask reddit thread mentioned harper lee minutes/hours before she was announced dead .
 harper lee wasnt it ?
 harper lee on a previous askreddit thread .
 yup ,  i’m pretty sure somebody jinxed carrie fisher to the hour .
 reddit needs to start only posting rotten old bastards in those threads .
 like ,  every answer should be mitch mcconnell .
 we could use our power for good for once .
 i think i accidentally killed leslie nielsen by watching airplane !
 the day before he died .
 yeah ,  aren &apos;t the avengers fighting the legion of doom in the next installment ?
 i also wouldn’t mind if his last cameo was in spider-man ,  considering how much he loved that character 
 he defeats thanos
 so never meet your heroes can &apos;t be applied to everyone ,  interesting !
 that’s true of most actors/famous people .
 in my experience the more well known you are ,  as long as you didn’t grow up rich/famous ,  the more you want to be treated like a regular person .
 or at least the regular person you were before fame .
 my general rule is treat anyone you meet for the first time like a new friend .
 you don’t know them even if you’re they’re biggest fan ,  you just know their work .
 i’m sure stan lee loved shooting the shit about craft services more than the billionth conversation he’s had about spider-man in the past six hours .
 i mean i didn &apos;t include him because that was a while ago ,  but i could have stated that lee was the last of the comic greats ,  except maybe alan moore but he was a bit later
 might be confusing him with jack kirby ?
 the queen is a notorious attire-troll .
 lots of money makes a difference 
 apparently james gunn only recorded 4 additional cameos with him ,  at least 3 already used and the 4th might not have been used in the end since they never revealed what movie it would be for ,  it wouldn &apos;t surprise me if the russos did the same thing last year with a few more movies 
 one of my buddies was telling me that he filmed 10 in the last year alone .
 i have no official source on this but here’s hoping it’s true .
 doesnt really matter ,  we &apos;ve already seen the stuff coming out of ms .
 marvel ,  if lee wanted he could have allowed marvel to use his likeness for cameo &apos;s via cgi .
 you can argue that cgi lee isnt the same as it actually being him ,  but moviegoers dont know lee like his friends and family do ,  and its not like they ever put him in a cameo that wasnt just  &apos;kooky old man &apos; .
 someone else mentioned the  &apos;5 cameos started with gotg2 &apos; .
 if that is true i think he &apos;s pretty much done anyway .
 my point being that a4 is the perfect movie for them to stop his cameos regardless if they have more .
 how can i delete these feels ?
 heard him on the comedy station driving home yesterday and he made this stupid joke about boobs ,  he called them knobs and i was laughing so hard .
 good comics never die .
 they just become part of the gas ass when they pass .
 cocaine is bad for your heart .
 this happened to me .
 i was 43 when my mother passed away .
 it really hit me hard ,  and was compounded by viciousness of extended family .
 i ended up having a series of strokes .
 don &apos;t have time to click the link but for anyone wondering ,  it &apos;s a self-limiting type of heart failure which means it doesn &apos;t last forever .
 in my limited experience of 3 years of grad work and 2 years of med school ,  i &apos;ve only seen one defined case of takotsubos .
 i &apos;m sure cardiologists see way more though .
 my 103-year old grandfather lost his wife (my grandmother ,  obv) a few years ago and we were preparing for this to happen ,  but after a year or two of grieving ,  he’s in seemingly good spirits again and is still healthy ,  so there’s hope !
 he &apos;s at the great comic shop in the sky
 it helps when you cameo in like 30 movies that gross at least 600 million dollars 
 then we should cheer him up .
 that’s the one that started it iirc .
 it was a huge thread and the top post was harper lee ,  and she died maybe 2 hrs later .
 this is the one i remember .
 did you talk about stan lee recently .
 the rest of the cameos can be portraits and pictures of him with funny faces .
 his last cameo was in spiderman .
 in his fed-ex uniform .
 that would make my soul happy .
 i &apos;d unironically like this idea .
 he can get one tiny part at the end where he sacrifices himself to go push some button in a place that ends up exploding and this button push was necessary to take down thanos .
 i don’t usually care about this celebrity stuff and try not to be a creep but on a very old iphone somewhere i have a photo of them hugging at the end of their conversation .
 gotta find it now .
  &apos;no one asks me about cheese !
 i have strong opinions .
 chris claremont is still alive .
 like when she wore a broach the obamas gave her when trump visited .
 i heard that thor ragnarok was filmed with stan lee portraying thor ,  and chris hemsworth performing the stan lee cameo ,  but that two months prior to presenting to critics they reshot the entire film because stan lee’s eyebrows were too lightly coloured .
 look at the knobs on her !
 knob city ,  usa !
 hey it &apos;s me your robert downey jr .
 epic rap battle of history
 if someone says david attenborough ,  i will personally find them and get visibly upset to make them feel bad .
 iirc the announcement of her death came 20 minutes after that person commented her name .
 it was the top comment because it was upvoted due to news breaking out .
 literally a comment from that thread : .
 (but don &apos;t ask any questions about stan lee just in case your jinxed
 i must have missed that one .
 well barack obama told me it was roughly 3 , 672
 my friend told me he filmed 95 .
 one every year he was born .
 not even gonna change it 
 plot twist: miss marvel actually gets fucked up ,  and stan lee who sacrifices himself to save the marvel universe .
 it wasn’t what we said but how he said it .
 cows have best friends .
 i’ll throw your name up in the next one i see .
 i can &apos;t believe /u/redhorsesagenda is still alive .
 i don &apos;t know who you are but i love you .
 we have good traits and bad traits .
 think of one good thing about yourself right now and try to think ,   &apos;huh ,  i &apos;m not that bad .
 have fun tonight .
 pm me of you want a pizza .
 with great power ,  comes great responsibility .
 why didnt you use your powers responsibly ?
 oh shit it &apos;s him .
 #stop right there .
 whoa ,  imagine being born 95 times .
 only the most audacious of us could be hope to have been born as many times as stan lee .
  what a legend .
 we need more nice people like you in this world .
 someone mention me too .
 and just in case ,  use my reddit username and my real name  &apos;geraldo del rivero &apos; 
 awww ,  you want him/her to live (considering you spelled their name wrong) .
 legit kamala miss marvel would be great in the mcu .
 start bringing in some younger heroes like her ,  kate bishop ,  sam/nova ,  miles/spider-man ,  etc and we could have a young avengers movie .
 vote obama guys .
 he’s very cool .
 just like my ice cubes ,  very cool guys .
 guys ,  he’s very cool .
 i would feel like  &apos;finally .
 lawmakers taking the public &apos;s issues to heart .
 i agree ,  and any ad for a auto service shop that plays squealing brakes or ominous engine sounds as well .
 reddit ,  how do you feel about common reddit opinion ?
 the fact that this is #3 for top of this year astounds me .
 also doorbells on commercials because my dogs .
 i was driving one day and listening to a very popular radio station in my region .
 and i saw all cars around me on the highway swerve a little bit when a commercial with sirens came on .
 very dangerous stuff if you ask me .
 in the city close to where i live carnival is very popular and very well known ,  for about one month each year the festival gets their own radio station with loud obnoxious party music that is quite funny .
 swerve is maybe an exaggeration but i saw the reaction of many drivers in my vicinity since the siren came on quite loud after the news bulletin .
 i want to ban askreddit posts about shit everyone will agree with 
 you see this kind of question so often ,  everyone already agrees with the post anyway ,  it contributes nothing and is blatant karma whoring
 redditors ,  what are your thoughts on low hanging fruit ask reddit questions and diamonds and vaccines ?
 this is the most circle jerk post i’ve seen in a very long time
 reddit ,  do you think water is wet ?
 oh fuck off i hate these posts ,  yes people want this ,  get out of here
 i &apos;d be fine with it .
  hell ,  i &apos;d encourage the ban .
  i flinch whenever those commercials are played .
 this is a bad post .
 you’re asking a leading question that an overwhelmingly majority already agrees with .
 reddit ,  how would you feel if we had hovercars that didn’t run on gas
  &apos;reddit ,  what &apos;s something you always bitch about and we all know the answer to ,  but i want a shitload of meaningless internet points ?
 what about songs with those noises ,  will they get banned too ?
 i would prefer a law that bans asking this same question every week
 almost no one will say no to this .
 fishing for upvotes op .
 how often is this an issue anyway
 why the fuck is this the top post of all time ?
 to be honest ,  i hate these type of posts .
 like is there anyone in the world who wouldn &apos;t be ok with a law like that ?
 what kind of discussion is going to take place here other than people agreeing with it ?
 this is literally a karma grab .
 i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a big enough issue to waste time thinking about
 add babies crying to that list and i &apos;ll sign the petition .
 i &apos;d feel good about it .
 there are already laws about what can be said in broadcast and the loudness of ads vs .
 the main content .
 i would feel it is a bad law .
 this is the top most upvoted thread in askreddit ?
 a question no one in their right mind would ever disagree with ?
 you guys are weird .
  &apos;reddit ,  how do you feel about (popular opinion) ?
 yet another soapbox opinion worded in the form of a question to shoehorn it into this sub .
 askreddit ,  how do you feel about banning this stupid type of  &apos;question &apos; ?
 yeah ,  i can’t imagine anyone reading this question and saying “naw ,  i don’t want to give up those split seconds of panic thinking an emergency vehicle is right up my ass” .
 apparently everyone here thinks they alone are responsible for their safety and the safety of the people riding with me .
 there are stupid/old people on the roads that will hear a commercial like that and for a split second think it’s real ,  and possibly react in a dangerous way .
 just because you’re a genius that never makes a mistake doesn’t mean the people you share the road with are too .
 ah ,  yes ,  one of the many human emotions: .
 lawmakers taking the public &apos;s issues to heart .
 please tell me this law would include the super annoying sfx radio hosts use .
 i have this little fantasy where i &apos;m giving my presidential acceptance speech ,  whatever it &apos;s called .
 it starts off ,  get the formalities out of the way ,  thank you ,  thank you .
 kiss some babies ,  whatever .
  &apos;now ,  my first act as president: anyone who changes lanes without using their indicator ,  a device designed to indicate to others of a lane change or turn ,  will be punished with death .
 an aid pulls me away from the mic to whisper in my ear .
  &apos;ok ,  apparently i can &apos;t do that .
 instead the punishment shall be life in pris .
 look over to my aid who is shaking their head .
  &apos;really ,  can &apos;t do that either ?
 if you change lanes without indicating you &apos;re a terrible person and i hope that sometimes keeps you awake at night .
 eh ,  i like to keep my fantasies realistic .
 there &apos;s an auto shop near me with an led sign .
 sometimes they have police lights flashing red/blue promoting state car inspections .
 i hate that sign driving home at night .
 it looks like there is a cop behind me .
 there’s a commercial that i get that is a couple in a car that screeches and then they scream .
 the orange box hardware store has a commercial that plays the fucking chime that sounds when a check engine light goes on for a newer gm .
 i fucking hate it !
 it strikes fear in me every fucking time .
 ban that shit already !
 i can &apos;t scream and cry for help in public unwarranted ,  but you can play ads inside my car that scare me into thinking i might be stranded miles away from home and forced to pay large expenses to fix my car ?
 bullshit ,  these fuckers need to be stopped .
 oh ,  did we scare you and got you in a little crash ?
 well ,  now you can have your car fixed for only 50% ,  call us now !
 and stay safe on the road not really .
 when i worked at an ice cream shop in college i would play spotify over the loud speakers .
 one of their prominently featured commercials that summer began with blasting machine guns .
 so many horrified customers .
 unrelated sort of but that mini heart attack when a rap song comes on hard with the 5-o siren while you &apos;re speeding
 i &apos;m so glad you asked !
 personally i feel the same feeling as everybody else .
 r/askreddit ,  how would you feel about banning ’how would you feel about’ questions ?
 yep ,  these posts are the modern day  &apos;dae &apos;
 15k upvotes in an hour .
 real quality content here .
 yeah like anybody &apos;s going to say that they like sirens in commercials .
 there should be a rule against these kind of posts ,  but it would be a bit hard to enforce objectively i guess .
 this is like the 10th time i &apos;ve seen this post
  &apos;it &apos;s not a big deal ,  i guess it &apos;s a thing but i &apos;ve never really thought about it till i saw everyone pissed off about it on reddit .
 maybe just calm down a bit y &apos;all &apos; .
 downvoted into oblivion
 finally someone said it .
 it’s like “reddit ,  what is it about racism that you dislike ?
 2 fucking nobel prizes
 yeah ,  it &apos;s just blatant circlejerk and karma whoring
 right ,  what kind of thread is this ?
 95% of calls to my cell phone have been spoof telemarketing calls that mimic the first 6 digits of my phone number .
 3-4 per day ,  real people don &apos;t call me very often .
 but it &apos;s extremely annoying and no matter how many numbers i block or how many times i report it ,  they keep coming .
 i &apos;d vote for anyone who proposed coming down hard on those assholes .
 i wish there was a way to ban junk mail or have laws imposed to require an opt in for commercial mail .
 trash is literally being delivered to my mailbox and i feel powerless to make it stop .
 anything that says “important information enclosed” is almost guaranteed to be junk mail  .
 looking at you ,  ted cruz .
 it &apos;s 2018 ,  why do we allow unsolicited junk mail in the first place ?
 how much of it goes directly to the trash ?
 you don &apos;t have those stickers for mailboxes that say:  &apos;no advertisements ,  no flyers &apos; ?
 where i &apos;m from it &apos;s illegal to ignore those .
 this is why i can &apos;t ever watch family feud with my dogs in the room .
 they lose their mind every time someone gets an answer right .
 we don &apos;t even have a door bell in our house ,  but they remember it from when we lived in our condo 4 years ago .
 we need big canine to lobby against this
 hah that used to bug me but my dog learned the difference between a tv doorbell and a real doorbell .
 might as well ban cats and dogs from commercials too cause well .
 my dogs too lol
 why the fuck would people think these type of things were ever a good idea .
 and on the reverse side people get used to it and don &apos;t respond to actual sirens and don &apos;t pull over .
 i &apos;ve started pulling over for sirens while other people take the chance to pass others .
 how are you gonna swerve before knowing which direction the cop/ambulance is coming from .
 very dangerous driving  
 the feasibility of all those cars listening to the same station at the same time is unlikely .
 even more unlikely that they all had the same reaction to a siren on their radio .
 wtf is this shit ,  this isn’t even a question ,  it’s like the reddit version of “one like means you love jesus ,  keep swiping if you love the devil” 
 seriously ,  like wtf would a counter-argument to this be ?
 i love hearing sirens in ads !
 not to mention there isn &apos;t much discussion to be had here besides  &apos;yes .
 dae hate de beers and nestle ?
 first thing i thought was  &apos;that &apos;s a surefire way to get some upvotes .
 water ain &apos;t wet ,  it makes other things wet !
 i think an individual water molecule is not wet .
 however if you have multiple water molecules close together and hydrogen bonding to each other ,  then the water is wet .
 so yes ,  water is wet
 i think it &apos;s funny that people like op post these questions that obviously everyone is going to agree with and we don &apos;t even get any answers .
 just a huge upvoted thread with everyone jerking each other off .
 e: y &apos;all are really gonna make this shit question the highest post in this sub &apos;s history .
 this shit is so common now .
 there was that other post a few days ago that was like ,   &apos;how would you feel if a woman instigated a conversation and asked you out ?
  &apos; like ,  of course that &apos;d be fucking great .
 who would say no to that ?
 exactly what i thought .
 like anyone is going to answer “no ,  i like songs with sirens in them ,  i find them soothing and helpful”
 how would reddit feel if vaccination was mandatory ?
 yep ,  this is just op griping in the form of a question to shoehorn it into this sub ,  and people are upvoting it because they agree .
 this is pretty much a violation of rule 5 .
 it &apos;s also really fucking boring .
  have you seen how people drive ?
 and it’s one of the six stock “this is super important guys” reddit issues: .
 radio ads with sirens .
 also ,  am i listening to the wrong radio stations ?
 because i never hear these fabled inescapable ads that are just honking and sirens .
 usually it &apos;s just people talking about a business and then a little jingle .
  &apos;upvote this post if you think child slavery should be illegal &apos;
 this happens a lot on this subreddit .
 it’s a circle jerk thread .
 i remember the first time i noticed it was asking if anyone would like a class that teaches basic life skills .
 one of the top answers to a ton of the biggest threads in askreddit history .
  &apos;you will get this large amount of money if you do this wacky ,  embarrassing ,  or terrible thing .
 would you do it ?
 one guy does a 15 paragraph break down on how they will invest the money ,  another finds a loophole around it ,  and one just says  &apos;yes &apos;
 how would you feel if good things happened to people instead of bad things ?
 ah so this one time around 5 years ago i knew a great friend who’s fathers’ sons’ daughter knew this awful guy who once said something supppper mean and it made me furious .
 because of this i always warn my kids to never be like this insert karma thanks
 that one katy perry song  &apos;california girls &apos; that was overplayed on the radio had a bit where you hear honking in the second verse .
 got me every damn time .
  artists already release album versions and radio edits for all kinds of things (length ,  expletives ,  etc .
 ) - if they are hellbent on including a siren in their song (which ,  why) ,  they can cut a second version for radio that omits it .
 radio edits are a thing
 or at least a radio edit without them .
 they already make radio edits ,  so why not ?
 i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s already the law in loads of countries anyway .
 a better leading question would be  &apos;reddit ,  how are americans behind other countries ?
  &apos; except you &apos;d still see the same answers echoing around like they always do .
 after looking it up ,  it &apos;s actually illegal here to do it in tv too .
 that &apos;s a surprise .
 man what ever happened to that ?
 i remember the ads on cable being way loud 10+ years ago .
 i remember the law too ,  but now i feel like the ads are getting loud all over again .
 imagine being so starved for validation that you have to post this softball question .
 i thought we were done with posts like this
 nothing like a heart attack in the morning .
 i could imagine someone making a 1st amendment argument for being able to express themselves through sirens and horns but ads are already limited in a lot of ways .
 i don &apos;t think it could get far but thinking about ways something like this could fail is interesting .
 i &apos;ve been startled by a siren sound before .
 caught me off guard ,  i guess i was deep in thought and then heard it and was startled thinking i was blocking an emergency vehicles from passing .
  instinctively ,  i took my foot off the accelerator and the person behind me got pissed and whipped around me and cut me off ,  almost hitting me to get in front of me .
  so basically it almost caused a wreck ,  in the chain of events .
 can &apos;t find any comments or shit like that ,  what &apos;s his deal ?
 i wonder what effect such legislation would have on songs with those sounds .
 etc ,  always my favorite human emotion with existential dread a close second .
 my therapist told me that when i feel “finally .
 lawmakers taking the public &apos;s issues to heart .
 “ ,  that’s when i am making real progress .
 lawmakers taking the public &apos;s issues to heart .
 weirdest character in inside out .
 macy nailed the part though .
 fittingly ,  right between happiness and anger .
 it will be done my lord
 they &apos;re just wacky sounds ,  you know to liven things up .
 there &apos;s a blindish curve on my way home from work .
 i often work evenings ,  so it &apos;s full dark when i &apos;m coming home .
 as i &apos;m approaching the curve ,  i see flashes of blue and red through the trees .
 every time ,  i start to brake ,  because obviously there &apos;s a cop stopped in the road .
 every time ,  it &apos;s just the stupid bar sign across the street .
 one of these days i won &apos;t brake ,  and i &apos;ll end up rear-ending an actual cruiser .
 fuck that commercial 
 on a related note ,  newer gm cars make the “bong bong bong” noise when you leave your blinker on for too long .
 it scares the shit out of me ,  thinking my tire is flat or my engine is overheating meanwhile it’s just my damn blinker .
 i can &apos;t scream and cry for help in public unwarranted ,  .
 how many times have you tried ?
 you definitely can ,  its just weird and unwarranted .
 there are laws against aggressive sales techniques .
 i wish someone would enforce them .
 i &apos;ve been about to cross an uncontrolled railroad crossing when a train horn played on the radio ,  nearly got rear ended .
 jack: the only thing i will be discussing with the house subcommittee on baseball ,  quiz shows ,  terrorism ,  and media is vertical integration .
 liz: what &apos;s vertical integration ?
 jack: imagine that your favorite corn chip manufacturer also owned the number one diarrhea medication .
 liz: that &apos;d be great ,   &apos;cause then they could put a little sample of the medicine in each bag .
 jack: keep thinking .
 liz: beat  except then they might be tempted to make the corn chips give you .
 current spotify doesn &apos;t have gun shots in their songs .
 really disappointed me when i was listening to this is america .
 no great transition at all .
 i think i might actually be wrong .
 and it &apos;s just that they have the studio version of this is america .
 yeah ,  but what about obscure edge case ?
 unpopular opinion: (state an opinion very popular)
 you might not agree with this but agrees with op
 oh i would love to ban so much shit from /r/askreddit .
 starting with these types of threads (the opposite of what this subreddit should be about) .
 followed by no-effort upvote-magnet responses like q: &apos;what tv show has a really interesting storyline ?
  &apos; a: &apos;game of thrones &apos; ,  q: &apos;firefly &apos; etc .
 thousands of upvote ,  nothing actually interesting to talk about .
 or how about answers that are just the same old quotes from the office ,  starting a comment chain with every single one comment being an overused quote or  &apos;/r/unexpectedoffice &apos; .
 also references to media (mostly video games) that don &apos;t specify what you are describing because of course you are only preaching to the choir and counting on upvotes from other fans ,  and not actually trying to advocate for your favorite medium to a general audience and to make an actual argument for it e .
 q: &apos;what character has the best redemption story ?
  &apos; a: &apos;johny after murdering suzy q &apos; .
 what &apos;s the point i mean what is the bloody point of such a comment other than to get upvotes from people who know what this references ?
 i feel like 95% of /r/askreddit threads are people just patting themselves on the back for repeating the same stuff over and over .
 /r/askmen recently banned questions like that .
 i &apos;m going to get free karma by going through old dae posts and transform it for askreddit .
 85k votes and 2 gold .
 holy shit ,  the circle jerk is unreal
 i have no evidence to back my case ,  but i &apos;m suspicious of the  &apos;how would you feel about .
  &apos;-type threads and the amount of upvotes they get .
 i refuse to believe the #3 and #14 all-time top askreddit threads ,  which each ask about old people needing to renew their licenses more often or whatever ,  actually garnered that much interest and recieved those placements legitimately .
 i dunno who would pay for votes for that topic in particular ,  but i &apos;m convinced someone did .
  &apos;how would you feel about a law that made getting kicked between the legs illegal ?
 these people really want to sell me a warranty for my 18 year old bmw
 have you answered the calls before ?
 if you ever answer a number you don &apos;t know that happens to be a spam call then you get put on a list of known good numbers and the calls will just increase .
 if you don &apos;t answer it assumes its a bad number and moves on .
 it &apos;s already illegal .
  they are spoofying caller id info and not calling from inside of the us ,  so there is not much they can do to stop them .
  i was up to about 6 of those types of calls per day .
  it &apos;s not been perfect but it &apos;s blocked the vast majority of them without much intervention from me .
 bullshit we need it but it &apos;s where we are it seems .
  spoofing a caller id number is super easy anymore .
 try  &apos;lenny &apos; - - perfect for those ,   &apos;i &apos;m soory ,  i was adjusting my headset ,  can you hear me now ?
  &apos; you join the two calls ,  and it &apos;s a robo script that keeps that electronic asshole engaged and talking until a real person picks up & then marks you as a bad number .
 i &apos;ll grab the user account - - you just message him your phone numbers and ask to be white listed .
 he white lists you ,  and you &apos;re good to start joining lenny to your robocalls .
 message u/mango123456 with the numbers you want them to white list .
 they &apos;ll confirm back and give you the number to use .
 i made a contact for  &apos;lenny &apos; and just join it as a third party and hang up .
 even worse - they started spam calling my grandma ,  while spoofing my dad &apos;s number .
 i &apos;m guessing they went through public record to get that info .
 how on earth are we supposed to block that ?
 i lived in an apartment complex that put recycling bins by the mail room .
 every day it would fill with 200x whatever junk flyers were put in everyone &apos;s boxes .
 a postman wastes their time putting it in every box ,  only to have people instantly get rid of it .
 if i could opt out of mail ,  i would .
 it &apos;s because the usps makes money off it regardless .
 ever wonder why they still make  &apos;yellowpages &apos; phone books ?
 and they still drop off like 5 at a time at your office ,  or one on your doorstep -- all free ,  of course ?
 because they &apos;re filled to the brim with paid advertisements .
 each one of those books represents like a hundred bucks worth of advertising they sold ,  maybe more .
 that &apos;s why it &apos;s free for you .
 because you &apos;re the target .
 it &apos;s just a giant fuck you to both me ,  who doesn &apos;t want the mail ,  and the environment .
 there &apos;s a national do not mail list .
 fun trick to do with junk mail: if it has a return address ,  cut it out and stick it on a box .
 fill the box with stones and dirt and mail it .
 they soon learn .
 time sensitive documents enclosed .
 right into the trash
 hey ,  it &apos;s apparently legal for a political campaign to say  &apos;summons enclosed: open immediately &apos; .
 texas resident ,  came looking for exactly this .
 this is why we prefer beto (other than the fact that cruz is a lizard in a human suit) .
 you &apos;d think he &apos;d want to avoid looking like a dishonest asshole .
 surprised the ted cruz reference under this one is down this far .
 this deserves to be the top reply under this comment imo .
 didn &apos;t know the zodiac killer was this bad
 the mail person puts whatever is addressed to you in your mailbox ,  it would be a felony for them to decide what mail you get and don &apos;t get .
 may i ask where your from ?
 where i work ,  it &apos;s illegal for us not to ignore those stickers .
 unfortunately someone somewhere paid that postage 
 i got my dog when he was three .
  i’ve had him for six years now and have never had a doorbell in that time .
  he still goes bonkers when he hears doorbells .
  i couldn’t even watch jeopardy for the longest time because it would just drive him crazy .
 there’s got to be some sort of evolutionary advantage to having a long memory for certain sounds .
 our doorbell sounds like the  &apos;correct &apos; sound on family feud .
 when theres someone at the door ,  we say  &apos;someone got the answer right on family feud &apos; and then not answer the door cause we hate people .
 my cats growl when they hear our doorbell .
 no idea where they learned it 
 i know it &apos;s just bollocks but between animals time 7 dog years pass for every human year .
 so the magic horn sounding for aid went silent and safe for 30 years in your dogs mind before it sounded again ,  and your dog came to save the family from monsters once again ,  even in retirement .
 it &apos;s definitely not digornos
 your dog is smart .
 mine will randomly freak out at the scrolling menu on netflix for no apparent reason ,  and only about 20% of the time .
 i hear their customer service is really good .
  if you send them a message ,  there &apos;s a good chance they &apos;ll respond and stop doing that .
 they understand perfectly .
 my tinfoil hat theory is that it &apos;s intentional .
 like if your dog barks every time a chewy commerical comes on ,  you &apos;re more likely to pay attention when the commercial comes on ,  and you become more and more aware of the commercials and chewy as a company .
 from there ,  i guess they hope that now that you &apos;re aware of the site ,  you &apos;ll be subconsciously more inclined to use it .
 but personally i &apos;m never going to support the brand that is maybe purposefully trying to get my dog to flip out on a daily basis lol .
 an advisory or a warning isn &apos;t the same as a regulation .
  things advised against can still be done ,  but the fcc says that they did their part ,  because they issued a warning .
 at the end of the day ,  a station isn &apos;t going to decline money from an advertiser who ignores this warning .
 nah ,  i was there .
 unpopular opinion ,  will probably be downvoted ,  but i think murder should stay illegal .
 they are already against the rules here .
 a counter-argument is that i don &apos;t want the additional government censorship .
  the law would be challenged by radio advertisers and overturned on constitutional grounds .
  individual states couldn &apos;t enact the law themselves because radio waves cross state lines making it a matter of interstate commerce and thus a federal matter .
 of course the people that put sirens and screeching brakes in radio ads should burn ,  but we should not be so quick to use the legislature to attempt to deal with these types of annoyances .
 have you heard of ea ?
 cue southpark smug fart inhalation .
 ohhhhhh thats good .
 just thinly veiled take on the  &apos;does anyone else (agree/disagree) with insert incredibly obvious ,  sensible ,  or popular opinion ?
 i guess these threads are popular because people like to feel validated .
 the worst is  &apos;reddit ,  if you could make a billion dollars for doing nothing ,  would you ?
 that was one of the dumbest prompts i &apos;ve ever seen here .
 its a way for the ops to farm karma and get their soapbox .
 men say we want that ,  but when it happens ,  we &apos;re often kind of shitty about it .
 we don &apos;t really want women to ask us out a lot of the time .
 we want the specific woman we &apos;re to chickenshit to ask out to ask us out .
  &apos;when the commercial with screeching tires comes on ,  it reminds me of when my mother sang to me as a boy .
 it &apos;s a warm memory .
 it &apos;s so fucking annoying .
 this will be one of the top r/askreddit threads this month and it literally will have no answers that are even worth reading but everyone is going to jerk each other off so it &apos;s fine .
 questions like these are just annoying and take away from actual good posts and discussions on this sub .
 hey reddit ,  how would you like to suck my dick ?
 e: y &apos;all are really gonna make this the highest post in r/askreddit history .
 reddit ,  how would you feel if a law is passed that requires dog owners to give their dogs belly rubs every hour on the hour ?
 “hi male redditors ,  how do you feel about girls making the first move ?
 that one is about twice a year
 those fuckers can &apos;t even use their turn signal !

 a little heart attack never hurt anybody !
 especially behind the wheel of a moving death machine .
 the issue isn &apos;t with the sound scare though ,  the sounds can be very misguiding and quite possibly lead to an accident .
 awesome read ,  thank you .
 yeah ,  you can’t use profanity over the air which would normally be protected by the 1st .
 you could easily make a case that those ads are a danger to the public .
 you aren &apos;t allowed to yell fire in a crowded movie theater when there isn &apos;t one because it can create a deadly stampede .
 what is the emotion of  &apos;not existential dread &apos; ?
 i remember it from my childhood .
 existential dread isn &apos;t an emotion ,  it &apos;s a way of life .
  &apos;etc &apos; is tied in first with  &apos;finally .
 lawmakers taking the public &apos;s issues to heart .
 ladies and gentlemen ,  i want to talk to you now about a popular new service in town that delivers feelings – whether you want them or not .
 this service has no name or contact information ,  it simply delivers feelings .
 you do not choose the feeling ,  though yelp reviews say “tingling horror” and “as though electrocuted ,  i stood before him” are the most popular so far .
 it is unclear where on yelp you look for these reviews .
 i myself have received a few feelings so far – such as “blood feud” and “frustrated origami novice” – and i’m looking forward to receiving more .
 i’m crossing my fingers for “should have left the party hours ago before i could disappoint her .
 ” i would also settle for “overcast wednesday” and “trampled by horses .
 i feel like this could be a line in bojack
 definitely deserves an oscar nomination for that performance .
 post that on the facebook page of your police department if they have one .
 file a complaint with your city/municipality .
 most communities have a regulation that no flashing light may be mounted if it disturbs drivers .
 in my city the rule is usually only enforced when someone complains .
 the passenger seat belt warning drives me nuts .
 it &apos;s 2 bottles of soft drink !
 stop telling me about the seat belt and give me my speedometer back !
 i mean ,  i could also be charged with disturbing the peace .
 freedom of speech has reasonable limits .
  you can &apos;t yell  &apos;fire !
 how many times have you tried ?
 every monday morning on his way to work .
 i wish politicians would do more for the people .
 if they ever passed a law like this ,  it would only be after it kills one of their own family because they don &apos;t seem to give a shit about the general population .
 one time my car stalled on train tracks and church bells instantly started playing before a christmas-themed radio ad .
 yeah i was pretty sure i’d just died .
 god i miss 30 rock .
 that should not be allowed to happen !
 e= fixed the quote .
 and all i wanna do is full measure of silence
  i think i might actually be wrong .
 and it &apos;s just that they have the studio version of this is america .
 yeah ,  the radio edit doesn &apos;t have gun shots ,  as they mainly serve the imagery in the video .
 also ,  they &apos;d scare the shit out of people not expecting them .

 but this is your last chance .

 i got a new car and started getting junk mail within a month telling me my factory warranty has expired or is about to expire .
 yeah my brand new car is totally out of warranty already :/
 2003 i had a company car for 6 months .
 more than 12 years later ,  i was still getting warranty calls .
 do what i do ,  if i dont know the number or im not expecting a call .
 if they really need talk to you they will leave a message .
  mileage may vary
 see i have to though because they make them look like my area and i also get legitimate calls from unknown numbers so i don &apos;t have the option of not picking up .
 never answered any and i get about 4-6 a day hitting my number .
 i always answer and tell them to die in a fire .
 there’s plenty they can do .
 it would just require investment/effort on account of the big telecom companies .
 the fact that voip essentially “talks to” the pre-existing phone circuits with literally no controls or securities is insane .
 but that won’t happen so here we are .
 if they include a return envelope i give them all my junk mail and send it back .
 or one time i filled it with dust and a cheerio i swept off my floor .
 too much effort .
 i &apos;ll outsource this .
 “here you go ,  throw this away”
 my delivery people just put a box with all of those flyers out in front of the mailboxes rather than distributing them to the boxes of the hundreds of units in the complex .
  grab one if you want it (wegmans coupons !
 ) ,  don’t if you don’t .
  best of both worlds .
 i only check my mail once every week or two .
 90% of it is flyers and expired coupons or mail for the people who lived here before me .
 i frequently take mail out of my box just to toss it in the garbage .
 the other 10% is bills i pay online anyway and occasionally a tax bill .
 i hate my mailbox .
 you &apos;d think they would eventually notice that most of them go straight in the recycling bin - or worse ,  the trash - without ever being opened .
 meaning their ad is not reaching the target at all ,  i mean who the fuck looks anything up in the yellow pages anymore ,  ever ?
 pretty sure it &apos;s just the printers ,  who rely on the phone book to float their entire business ,  working to convince advertisers that people still use the book when they just don &apos;t .
 the local newspaper throws advertisements in my driveway at least a few times a month ,  even in the rain .
 i don &apos;t have a newspaper subscription .
 i called them 4 of times asking them to stop throwing their trash in my driveway but still get them a few times a month .
 that people ignore ,  and it is a pain to report .
 that shit never works .
 wait how would this work without you paying to mail it back ?
 not the return address on top corner of the original envelope .
  i think we &apos;re talking about if the mail has some kind of pre-paid return envelope inside .
 postal regulations allow the us post office to throw those away ,  all you really wind up doing is annoying your letter carrier .
 now ,  you \\can\\ put blank paper or some random comics  in a business reply envelope and mail it back ,  which will waste a few seconds of a minimum wage employee &apos;s time .
  just remember that it &apos;ll go to some poor sucker who works for minimum wage at the bank ,  and put in something that they might find amusing or entertaining rather than a print out of goatse or glitter or something else that will annoy them but won &apos;t hurt the executives responsible in the slightest .
 he already got fined for doing the same thing during his presidential campaign .
 he doesn &apos;t give a damn how he looks .
 just look at him .
 he sent fundraising solicitations in envelopes marked  &apos;official summons - open immediately &apos;
 yeah ,  it saves you from being eaten by sabertooth tigers .
 either your cat is weird (whose cats aren &apos;t lol) or it might be that the door bell is the exact right pitch that hurts his ears/annoys him .
 yeah ,  can we get him lobbying ?
 their customer service is really good- i’ve had to contact them before .
 there is a chance that they listen .
 i get it ,  but literally no one is happy when their dog loses their shit .

 i emailed an advertiser and radio station when i heard one of these ads .
  the next day ,  the ad was no longer on the radio .
 dae the witcher 3 ?
 we would really like the radio sounds in question to stop .
 litigation may not be the answer .
 for once ,  an awareness movement might be all that &apos;s needed to do the trick .
 let the advertisers know we don &apos;t want their products if they &apos;re going to endanger us to get our attention .

  &apos;hey reddit how would you feel about a law that punishes bad things and/or rewards good things ?
 you get a million dollars ,  but here’s the catch: you have to watch your favorite movie for 24 hours straight !
 not so easy now is it ?
 you still can &apos;t put anything in the text box on /r/askreddit ,  and it &apos;s one of the greatest moderating decisions in the history of reddit .
 before that rule was put in place ,  half the questions were asked just so op could post their own story in the text box ,  and half of the top-level replies were directed at op &apos;s story ,  and half were answering the question .
 i &apos;m a mod here and i hate these stupid circlejerk questions ,  unfortunately ,  the way this is written doesn &apos;t really break any rules .
 it borders closely on 5 ,  but not enough to warrant removal .
 trust me i would love nothing more than to pull the question ,  but unless we make a rule to prohibit these ,  i can &apos;t .
 reddit ,  how would you feel about a law that requires you to suck u/refsoxeatpoop  &apos;s dick ?
  &apos;how would you feel about people over 80 years old having to take a yearly driving test ?
 unless you &apos;re smoking a blunt and a commercial with the police siren goes off .
 i would much rather the radio announcer scream fuck over the siren/crash/train noises in commercials .
 its already beem established that the first doesn &apos;t allow you to yell  &apos;fire &apos; in a crowded theater .
 i feel like this would be a kin to that ,  in that the probability exists for it to incite a dangerous panic response brought on by a false emergency signal .
 people love saying that ,  but iirc the judge who said that was just making up an example--it &apos;s not from case law and that exact situation &apos;s never lead to a conviction .
 you &apos;d have to prove malice .
 it &apos;s that feeling from the land before time where the kids find the great valley .
 that &apos;s just regular dread .
 that &apos;s an honest position and i can respect it .
 this could be a line in a very famous teevee shooow
 what are they going to do ?
 tell them they can’t have blue and red lights ?
 lpt : you can &apos;t be charged with disturbing the peace if you &apos;re in a warzone .
 or inciting a panic
 you can if there’s a fire .
 but what if a character onscreen addresses the audience ,  saying  &apos;the ____ triangle consists of fuel ,  heat ,  and oxygen .
 please yell your answer .
 it &apos;s still there ,  man .
 and it &apos;s even better than you remember .

  &apos;i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re being downvoted .
 we have been trying to contact you about your cars limited warranty program .
 nissan keeps spamming us ,  wanting us to trade in our car .
 that we sold 6 years ago .
 that &apos;s the thing - i &apos;m applying for jobs and am expecting calls from potential employers .
 they got me and they know it .
 spam calls don &apos;t call twice rapidly .
 if someone needs me i &apos;ll base it on that .
 people don &apos;t leave messages as much anymore even for emergency shit .
 i pick up unknown calls and immediately mute my mic unless it &apos;s interesting (never happens) .
 i went from 2-3 per day down to 2-3 per month .
 i moved to a new state years ago and kept my cell number .
 no one calls me from my cell phone area code anymore .
 except spam callers .
 if it &apos;s from the area code i live in now it &apos;s a legit call .
 downloaded an app that allows me to block all calls from a specific area code .
 blocked my phone &apos;s area code .
 now i see almost zero spam calls .
 lol ,  this is what i &apos;ve started doing for all the mortgage reduction notices i receive .
 i &apos;m tempted to start using glitter .
 as someone who worked in a mail room ,  please don &apos;t .
 it only affects us ,  the people that added your address to a shitty marketing mail bomb never have to deal with this and the company wastes more money on remodeling people &apos;s offices before moving them to a new position and remodeling again than they do on the return postage .
 i know it &apos;s satisfying to send back a  &apos;fuck you &apos; but the company already gave us enough of a  &apos;fuck you &apos; in the form of minimum wage and general degradation of working the mail room .
  &apos;pls retweet this or you shall be visited by jorge the ghost chihuahua in your sleep .
 i once saw a forklift ,  lifting a bunch of forks ,  and it just got too literal for me
 i used to like mitch .
 i still do ,  but i used to ,  too .
 you &apos;d think they would eventually notice that most of them go straight in the recycling bin - or worse ,  the trash - without ever being opened .
 except they don &apos;t .
 they don &apos;t need to be used by everyone to be effective .
 just like not every person who watches a commercial goes out and buys the product .
 all it takes is like one in a thousand and bam: profits .
 it &apos;s wildly and even obscenely wasteful but there ya go .
 this is an example of the sackwalker rule: if it is more work to \stop\ doing something ,  people will \keep\ doing it .
  in this case figuring out how to exclude your house from their garbage dumping is just too much work .
 they used to do that here ,  but then they had to put an ad box on everyone &apos;s mailbox .
 i just refused to take anything out of it .
 it got stuffed so full ,  they couldn &apos;t put anything else in there .
 after awhile i finally cleaned it out but they haven &apos;t put anything in there since .
 i would like to take their box off my mailbox but my husband thinks that &apos;s too rude .
 so it works like the do-not-call list
 i think he means the return envelope they usually give you to mail back your order or whatever .
 it requires no postage from you .
 instead the postal service bills them (it is done this way so they don &apos;t pay for useless postage stamps)   .
 it still costs them to have whatever sent back .
 and because postage is by weight you end up costing them a ton

 a small station may take down an ad for that ,  though it &apos;s also possible it was a coincidence .
  but either way: that &apos;s on the station end ,  not any fcc regulation .
 to be fair ,  you have to have a very high iq to understand witcher 3 .
 the humor is extremely subtle ,  and without a solid grasp of polish folklore most of the jokes will go over a typical player &apos;s head .
 there &apos;s also geralt &apos;s nihilistic outlook ,  which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromnarodnaya volya literature ,  for instance .
 the fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these games ,  to realize that they &apos;re not just entertainment- they say something deep about life .
 as a consequence people who dislike witcher 3 truly are idiots- of course they wouldn &apos;t appreciate ,  for instance ,  the humour in geralt &apos;s existencial catchphrase  &apos;come on you piece of filth &apos; which itself is a cryptic reference to turgenev &apos;s russian epic fathers and sons i &apos;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as andrzej sapkowski &apos;s genius unfolds itself on their monitors .
 how i pity them .
  and yes by the way ,  i do have a witcher 3 tattoo .
 and no ,  you cannot see it .
 it &apos;s for the ladies &apos; eyes only- and even they have to demonstrate that they &apos;re within 5 iq points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand .
 because reddit gonna circlejerk and people go crazy when popular posts are removed even if they break the rules .
 it &apos;s whatever ,  let them have their fun .
 well be back to  &apos;serious what &apos;s the creepiest thing to ever happen to you ?
 what’s the process for making a rule to prohibit these ?

 so little timmy set the spark -   .
 he took a puff and sighed .
 and sirens sounded out the dark .
 and timmy fucking died .
 this happened to me listening to spotify on speakers in my fucking house before i got premium .
 a commercial like that with horn sounds literally almost got me and my little sister killed once when i was driving her to school ,  which i why i don &apos;t listen to anything with commercials while i &apos;m driving .
 oh for sure ,  i might actually buy their product then .
 i don’t care if i have a genuine need for a product ,  if they have a commercial with sirens or something equally annoying i’m going without .
 you also don &apos;t have a right to the spectrum .
  that &apos;s where the fcc gets its power to say what you can &apos;t say or do on the radio .
 the better comparison here is you have a right to free speech but not a right to an audience .
  you have a right to free speech ,  but not a right to stand in the highway to speak .
  public property is still property .
 the outcome was that you &apos;d need proof that speech directly encouraged others to commit crime or cause danger .
 it &apos;s a grey area .
 if you could prove that these commercials cause traffic collisions and the broadcaster still played them ,  despite knowing their effect ,  you could have grounds for accusing malice
 or taking your bra off after a long day .
 that &apos;s what i call a monday
 some states it &apos;s regulated how red and blue lights are to be used .
 everyone saying ya but only on vehicles .
 well ya spotlights are legal too but you can &apos;t have them on a building fucking with drivers either .
 if you &apos;re causing significant disruption/distraction to traffic through your signs it is illegal .
 like spotlights aren &apos;t illegal .
  but if you aimed them at traffic you bet it is .
 if the peas are mixed up with the carrots ,  you might want to reconsider your statement .
 but you can be charged with a dui for trying to drive from the passenger seat .
 but can you be charged with disturbing the war ?
 wait ,  but if we &apos;re fighting the war on drugs in america ,  doesn &apos;t that make the entire country a warzone for this specific  &apos;war &apos; ?
 tchaikovsky: i &apos;m gonna use cannons as instruments .
 everyone: tchaikovsky ,  no .
 tchaikovsky: tchaikovsky ,  yes .
 i &apos;m not disagreeing that they should be censored on the radio .
 but if you are on spotify ,  you can choose songs you know don &apos;t have gunshots for when you &apos;re driving .
 shitty pun riding the koattails with klever spelling everyone will hate
 response that is far ,  far too late
 broken arms colby coconut 
 unnecessary comment about how many upvotes the comment before has .
 joke about how the comment about downvotes is now being downvoted
  &apos;this should be at the top .
 obligatory  &apos;thanks for the gold ,  kind stranger !
 a car from a brand you and your family have never even debated owning 
 i keep getting this fucking awful spam call about my car &apos;s  &apos;extended warrantee .
 this is the last time we will call you about your extended warrantee .
  &apos; always emphasizing the last syllable .
 it &apos;s like they make it a point to be as unbearably obnoxious as possible just to ruin your day .
 i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s some regional accent or something but it &apos;s the worst pronunciation of any word that has ever traveled through my ear into my brain .
 yesterday they called me five times in one day .
 i blocked all the numbers ,  added myself to the state and national do not call lists ,  and they still called me again ,  just to hang up as soon as i answered .
 i don &apos;t even own a car .
 i paid of my car in february .
 last month i get a call from toyota saying that theres alot of equity in my car right now and if i trade it in ill get a good deal on a new car .
 i said dude ,  my car is 5 years old and i just hit 27 , 000 miles ,  i think i &apos;m good for a while .
 he said yeah i &apos;m just gonna go ahead and delete your number out of our system .
 yeah :/ its such a shitty thing .
 just let the potential employer leave a message .
 just dont let it happen too many times .
 you dont wanna end up playing phone tag like i did .
 when i was job hunting ,  i got a throwaway phone just for job hunting .
  i also created a special email address just for job hunting .
  i didn &apos;t want those offers to sell encyclopedias ,  door-to-door ,  to get mixed up with aunt hazel &apos;s meatloaf recipes .
 use a google voice number for all future job applications .
 that way for a while you know it &apos;s probably a legit caller .
 i used google voice for lending tree because i didn &apos;t wanna get mortgage offers until the end of time .
 i wanted to be able to choose when they get to me and when they don &apos;t .
 the ones that have been calling me will call twice in succession to get by my emergency dnd override .
 the first call will last only long enough to pop up on my phone and they call right back .
 i just had to turn the override off and hope that anyone that needs me is on my whitelist .
 spam calls don &apos;t call twice rapidly .
 they just started doing that in the past few months for me ,  probably because it breaks through dnd on most phones .
 they don &apos;t deserve that cheerio !
 you only give those dust !
 i &apos;ve been saving those from mortgage insurance letters .
 i have about 10 and i &apos;m trying to decide what to stick in them .
 i don’t think household dust kitties are easily mistaken for “white chemical powder”
 send the dust straight to the fbi then .
  cut out the middleman .
 all this does is get glitter over some poor worker who is paid minimum wage to input data to a computer .
 just don &apos;t open the can (or whatever the glitter comes in) or you &apos;ll become the glitter &apos;s victim too .
 i deal with the mail at my large office .
 i send back the labels with a note saying to remove them from their mailing lists ,  or email if there is no return address .
 it works for the most part .
 uline ,  llbean and design within reach--not so much ,  screw those guys .
 my business partner was a salesman .
  he had a saying ,   &apos;the more shit you throw at a wall ,  the more that sticks &apos; .
 he would just keep talking until someone bought something .
 even one in a thousand seems outrageously high to be honest .
 i remember once some newspaper in my home town had to do this .
 they just drove up and a guy hopped out and start screwing it in .
 i was a little kid and i was like  &apos;what are you doing my grandpa is going to be mad &apos; and he ignored me .
 we get big construction to foot the bill
 he became a book star and now he &apos;s got a big head .
 it &apos;s a great idea if the sirens make you crash .
 chances are you &apos;ll need a new car asap and who better to go to than the assholes who made you crash in the first place ?
 doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a good car .
 if you &apos;re driving an old ,  crappy car then that would be the perfect time to advertise since you are currently experiencing how bad your car is and how much you need a new one .
 where do i donate ?
 must be the same dude \\\\
 how about a circus ?
 if it gets bad enough ,  the fcc can and will act on it .
  it &apos;s a reactionary agency ,  not proactive .
 reddit ,  how would you feel about banning circlejerk clickbait titles on /r/askreddit ?
 usually it involves a trial period of prohibition .
 when i brought this up like a year ago not enough agreed it was a problem ,  but i might bring it up again since so many people seem against it this time around ,  so clearly there is a good chunk of the community that dislikes these too .
 ah ,  yes ,  one of the many human emotions: .
 lawmakers taking the public &apos;s issues to heart .
 dang this thread really threw me around memory lane in ways i would &apos;ve never considered
 at least timmy died happy this time .
 finally caught a fresh sprog within the hour .
 timmy doesn’t often fare well in your poems .
 ooh man i really liked that one 
 haven’t seen you in a couple days ,  took a break ?
 that was a good one ,  i feel honored .
 part of the reason i listen to npr although honestly they have a lot of crap that sounds like traffic and car noises also .
 that &apos;s only true regarding current case law .
 a hypothetical new law would just be a new restriction .
 passing that law would likely be based around the safety of train horns ,  sirens ,  etc .
 being broadcast over the air .
 is this like taking your shoes off after a hard day of working ?
 i’m gonna start wearing a bra ,  just so i can take it off after a long day .
 throw some white in there and it’s patriotic now .
 not only that ,  most municipalities have laws regarding signage .
  i &apos;m pretty sure there &apos;s a code violation there .
 if nothing else ,  it &apos;s distracting drivers ,  that &apos;s a safety hazard in of itself without needing to be violating x or y law about lights ,  colors ,  etc .
 i know someone who had to change the color of their driveway lights because they looked like headlights pointing in the wrong direction .
 the driveway was in a corner so it looked like you were about to hit a car head on .
 i feel like this is the first half to a secret code ,  and if you say ,   &apos;but the stew is already full of potatoes .
  &apos; back he &apos;s gonna hand you a briefcase .
 i like to blend up my peas .
 can you imagine ?
 just visualize whirled peas .
 relevant username i see .
  i never would have remembered you as  &apos;punk dude who fought off a drugged up dual-wielding karate ninja with a skateboard ,  also breathes fire &apos; if i hadn &apos;t tagged you .
  &apos;i was a band geek .
 what instrument did you play ?
  &apos;the 203mm smoothbore .
 a witty ,  original pun but posted 9 hours into the thread
 i ,  too ,  have something to say
 i usually call back immediately and say “sorry !
 i get so many robot calls i try not to answer unknown number .
 but i have this number saved now so i know it’s you .
 ” everybody totally gets it .
 might be a good idea to save the number if you end up having to leave them a message back in return .
 but if you call back right after you get the message then chances are they will answer .
 i missed a call from a potential employer at like 4:30pm .
 didn’t notice i had a voicemail until after business hours .
 called them back the first free second i had at work the next day and their response was “well we didn’t hear back from you so we assumed you weren’t interested” .
 ive had potential employers not leave messages and then when i go look the number up after i &apos;m dead inside 
 this is not an universal solution .
 i have a messenger coming at least once a week .
 plus calls from colleagues within a large corporation .
 my question is ,  if the popular apps that tell you if the number is a known marketer help or not .
 that &apos;s some next level bullshit right there .
 hasn &apos;t happened to me yet .
 heh ,  i also have plenty of dirty cat litter .
 perhaps they &apos;d like some of that as well .
 if i was that poor minimum wage worker i would probably understand .
 most of these places have large machines designed to open and pull out the letters from the envelopes ,  the glitter would get in the machine and gunk it up .
 are you saying you don &apos;t appreciate the identical monthly catalogs bigger than the phone book ?
 i started using mine for paper-mâché and the bottom of flowerpots and pressing flowers .
 ah the old  &apos;if i buy something he will shut up and leave &apos; tactic
 thats why i could never be a salesman .
  &apos;can i tell you about this amazing product .
  &apos;oh ok im sorry have a good day &apos;
 think about the dumbest person in any random grouping of 1000 people ,  and it becomes a bit more clear .
 there are seriously dim bulbs out there .
 so ,  bob the builder ?
 the military industrial radio commercial complex must be stopped !
 think he meant a haiku
 i find it hard to believe a mod team wouldn &apos;t agree to it now after so many in the past couple of months so please do !
 etc ,  always my favorite human emotion with existential dread a close second .
 your sentiment is even more terrifying .
 apparently ,  timmy always dies in a car crash across all the universes .
 in this one ,  at he dies happy .
 pretty sad and horrible if you ask me .
 you can buy gold ,  but you can &apos;t buy a /u/poem_for_your_sprog .
 it &apos;s also kinda like when she takes her bra off after a long day
  &apos;bras are like boob shoes .
  &apos; - sudden clarity clarence ,  getting home from a long day at work
 then they &apos;ll do the white as strobes ,  and it &apos;ll still look like a cruiser .
 kill em with the details .
 most cruisers have white lights now as well .
 there was this lady i used to help with some of her accounting ,  and it would always entail picking up and handing off suspicious briefcases full of documents in the middle of the night .
  i loved it ,  but i also hated it .
 i just have a tendency to make pour decisions .
 remembered you as  &apos;punk dude who fought off a drugged up dual-wielding karate ninja with a skateboard ,  also breathes fire &apos; .
 when you say it like that it makes my terrible life choices seem slightly less terrible .
 i really needed that today .
 i read that as teenage poop / sex innuendo .
 random reply from some fucking weirdo two months later
 at that point just call them back and appologize for not hearing the phone .
 unless they have a serioud problem im sure they wouldnt hold that against you .
 doubt those apps would help .
 the spammers spoof a local number ,  different each time .
 that number likely belongs to a real person who has no idea of or control over the spammers .
 might be a federal offense ,  and the poor guy whose job is to open the return mail doesn &apos;t deserve your anger .
  it is like yelling at the cashier because the company has a shitty policy .
  though ,  i imagine you are just joking .
 it decreases the production of that poor employee ,  which could look bad on his performance review .
 but on the bright side ,  it decreases the efficiency of the center costing them more money .
 but you &apos;d need a lot more of them to make a dent .
 i &apos;m an engineer that works for a sales company ,  and when i go on sales calls it &apos;s so rough .
 i &apos;m sitting there with our sales guy and he just won &apos;t shut up and the customer is clearly not interested ,  and i &apos;m sitting there internally cringing wishing i could apologize for the both of us and leave .
 but i guess it works somehow because our sales guys all hit their numbers every year .
 i &apos;m lucky in that i was not a salesman ,  but a techie guy ,  but when i started my business back in 2001 ,  there was me and the salesman .
  i would often have to field technical questions which ended up being a type of sales .
  the lucky part was that i believed in the product we sold and i was excited about it ,  so i just talked about it and let the selling take care of itself .
 seriously ,  the dumbest in a hundred is enough .
 pretty sure he can fix it .
 i like yoga pants ,  .
 sandals and lingerie too .
 stop using sirens .
 check out his post history .
 timmy dying is a common theme .
 or her yoga pants
 red white and blue only means freedom until it &apos;s flashing behind you
 well ,  you just probably were being tailed by the fbi for a while .
 welcome to a list ,  brother !
 terrible life choices are just 200iq plans in disguise !
 they use real numbers .
 i get a call every once and a while from a lady with a similar number to mine .
 she always leaves a message asking who this is ,  and why this number keeps calling her .
 meh ,  i doubt i &apos;d add anything besides other junk mail .
 maybe for one of the really extra scummy ones .
 how would it be a federal offense though ?
 if people can send manure and glitter bombs ,  i doubt there &apos;s anything against kitty litter and etc .
 working for a junk mail company isn &apos;t comparable to a cashier at walmart and  &apos;a shitty policy &apos; .
 the  &apos;shitty policy &apos; of a junk mail company is their entire business .
 it &apos;s working at a place that purposefully annoys people .
 it &apos;s like sex; ask every woman you see ,  even if she &apos;s clearly not interested because eventually someone will say yes .
 who goes to work in their yoga pants ?
 name checks out ,  well done .
 i always live just boring enough that after several months ,  they would grow tired of surveiling .
  &apos;what is your position ?
  &apos;we are outside suspect &apos;s home .
  &apos;report on suspect &apos;s activities .
  &apos;he appears to be watching netflix ,  sir .
  also ,  we can report that he has opened another beer ,  that makes four beers .
  additionally ,  he appears to be falling asleep now .
  yes ,  definitely sleeping while watching netflix after four beers ,  sir .
 and here we have it ,  the template of 99% of all reddit threads !
 that guys dead wife .
 i think feces may qualify as hazardous materials ,  human feces do
 i think we should make this a national movement .
 everyone start sending junk mail back in prepaid envelopes until these companies can &apos;t sustain the cost of mailing out and having to pay someone to open and process their own useless junk mail .
 i know guys who do that .
 i cant come up with the confidence or ability to handle rejection like them ,  but it seems to work for them .
 im pretty immature about rejection ,  i take it super personal .
 my friend though ,  he can be told to fuck off by a woman and laugh it off like nothing happened .
 im half jealous ,  half thinking hes an asshole .
 this thread is making me feel old .
 i was working as a stockboy in a supermarket and when we had to fill the milk cooler people would bust open a 12 pack of milk cartons and put them in one by one .
 on my first day i just placed the 12 pack in the cooler and cut the plastic off on one side with my box cutter and yanked it from under it and the look of the store manager and the other employee who was training me was pure bewilderment .
 from that day everyone did it my way .
 start of lockdown ,  my 9 year old son was having worksheets emailed to complete at home .
 one day ,  left him at the laptop doing his maths while i made some dinner with my 3 year old daughter .
 walked into the living room with his dinner to find him asking the alexa all of his maths questions .
 worked as a laborer at a nursery one summer .
 daily tasks included manually watering 15 , 000 plants each day .
 put together a back of the napkin plan to build an irrigation system and spent the next few weeks building it with some money from the boss .
 that system is still running 15 years later and does all the work now .
 i did automate myself out of the job and had to find another eventually .
 couple years later got my engineering degree .
 i’m convinced engineers are inherently lazy people that will spend a disproportionate effort to make things easier .
 my brother in law spent a whole summer trying to figure out how to fix his sagging deck at the lake which he could in theory crawl under and jack it up .
 it would have been a tunneling project .
 it &apos;s a 60x60 area all long 2x6 boards .
 i sat there long enough with enough beers in me to come up with the idea of just cutting a square out of the sagging area about 3ft x 3ft ,  jacking it up then re-screwing down the boards .
 he paints the thing every spring with a roller anyhow so it &apos;s not like the square cut shows up .
 he thought i was a genius .
 i was just lazy .
 we had to hold a thermometer in water in chemistry class .
 it probably was only 20 minute experiment but your arms get tired after a couple minutes and you can’t let the thermometer touch the bottom of the pan or it won’t get an accurate reading .
 so instead of sucking it up and just holding the thermometer ,  my lab partner built a contraption out of lab books and paperclips to somehow hold the thermometer in the water without it touching bottom .
 it was the stupidest looking thing you would ever see in a lab class and our professor even walked over and said “if it looks stupid ,  sounds stupid ,  but it works ,  then it isn’t stupid .
 ” my lab partner and i joke that he wasn’t talking about the contraption but the intellect of my lab partner
 i had a math teacher that actively encouraged his students to be as lazy as possible ,  defining lazy as actively searching for ways to do as minimal work as possible .
 his logic was that ,  the way math is now ,  it could always be simplified and still work the same ,  someone just needs to be lazy enough to find that .
 i was a (paid) intern at a large company during one summer back home from college .
 my work 95% consisted of using sap ,  import to excel ,  clean data and generate reports (occasionally create some tool someone needed) .
 in the 1st 2 weeks after getting a hang of my responsibilities ,  writing all the excel formulas needed ,  and basically automating 99% of my work ,  i was chilling .
 i went from actually working from 9-5 to maybe 1 hour tops a day .
 finding ,  importing ,  cleaning ,  and reporting usually took hours but with all the formulas it took 2 minutes of clicking .
 i then helped the other cool intern get his shit set up so we could both just chill .
 we could take 2-hour lunches (paid for by the company) and nobody said anything cause we were just getting so much more done than the other interns .
 ofc i helped for special tasks when asked but those were simple 20min tasks building something in excel .
 overall ,  was the easiest/stress-less internship of my life .
 the clerk was asked to bring 145 white papers into the office .
 he doesn &apos;t want to count the papers manually so he printed 145 blank sheets and took them in .
 one of my favorite examples is andy kim .
 and i &apos;d like to preface this by saying that i don &apos;t think kim is lazy so much as a genius .
 andrew youakim was a singer/songwriter who became famous under the stage name andy kim .
 he achieved success writting songs for bands like the archies ,  possibly most notably  &apos;sugar ,  sugar .
  &apos; after his success he coasted for awhile until his record label dropped him for lack of output .
 at that point he created his own  label and cranked out hits like  &apos;rock me gently .
  &apos; when they saw this ,  the big record labels then bought his label under the assumption that they would then profit off of the songs he wrote and performed .
 he then very shortly stopped writing songs and largely lived off the sale of his label .
 work smarter not harder .
 it took me like 3 months ,  but i automated a data pipeline to extract data ,  clean it up ,  and spit it out in an excel or pdf format to one of our clients .
 i walked over to shoot the shit with the lady who handles my client and gives me tasks and she told me we make 40k off them every month for that automated job .
 fuck ,  i need to go start my own business .
 when  carl friedrich gauss ,  the famous german mathematician and physicist was in elementary school (around 1784) ,  his class was assigned the  &apos;busy work &apos; task of adding all the numbers from 1 to 100 (1+2+3+4 ,  and so on) .
 this usually kept the class quiet for half an hour or so .
 seven year-old carl  was sitting quietly with the correct answer (5050) while the rest of the class was just starting ,  so the surprised teacher asked him how he came up with the solution .
 he replied that he added 1 and 100 and got 101 .
 he realized there was a pattern of 50 pairs of numbers with each pair adding up to 101 .
 when i was in college i had a job at an italian fast food place with a reputation for it &apos;s breadsticks .
 they came in frozen and needed a bit to thaw ,  so we &apos;d take a giant 3x4ft aluminum baking sheet ,  spread them out in a single layer with no spaces and cover it with a plastic bag ,  then leave it sit in the walk-in overnight .
 the next day you &apos;d have to get a pair of tongs and move each stick to a new tray ,  turning them over ,  then cover the new tray with the bag and let them sit on racks for a couple of hours before brushing on the garlic butter sauce .
 this was tedious enough that you &apos;d usually be ready to brush the butter on the first tray as soon as you turned the last tray .
 i was given this task for the first time one morning and just did not want to deal with it .
 i realized if i put the second tray upside down on top of the first one then turned it over and took the first tray out ,  i got exactly the same results .
 blew the boss &apos;s mind when i did the 3 hour job in about 15 minutes .
 i was given a $0 .
 i was once set to test a certain piece of equipment on a ship .
 the test involved attaching the unit to a reader ,  then run loads of command line commands .
 then ,  one would have to make a copy of all the text ,  copy it into word and save it as a (real crappy looking) report .
 there was hundreds of units ,  and they needed to be testet several times a year .
 we did about 20-30 a day .
 it would take several weeks to finish .
 i didn &apos;t know coding at the time ,  but always wanted to learn it .
 within two months ,  i had made a program ,  even with a gui (to spot faults with ease ,  instead of having to actually read the reports) .
 the program could read three units at a time ,  and would automatically create a smooth pdf report and save it on our server ,  named with serial number and date .
 the job was now to attach three units ,  then wait for about 3 minutes ,  detach and attach new ones .
 basically 30 seconds work ,  3 minutes break .
 i could now test all units in a day ,  though i would typically spread it out over a couple more days .
 when i left the company ,  i left the program on the test computer .
 i got an email from an ex colleague a few months later ,  saying they were using the program on several ships now .
 there wasn &apos;t any manual for the program ,  of course ,  but it was so straight forward that it wasn &apos;t needed .
 if i need directions i &apos;m not asking a man with one tooth ,  i &apos;m asking a man with one leg .
 cause he definitely knows the easiest way to get there .
 yup ,  if there &apos;s a shortcut that one legged fucker knows where it is .
 you won &apos;t be hoppin &apos; fences neither .
 i plug clocks in at midnight so they &apos;re already set .
 eating dinner out of the pot so there’s fewer dishes to wash .
 an older company had a person dedicated to “data entry” which boiled down to copying and pasting portions of data from text files into spreadsheet and formatting into a report .
 the person originally doing this job spent a full 40+ hours/week doing it ,  but was not very computer literate .
 when they retired ,  the company hired someone with actual skills .
 the new hire convinced management to let her work remotely after getting up to speed on the job .
 the first week at home was spent automating the entire job .
 the remainder of their multi-year tenure with the company was spent doing whatever they wanted save the 10-15 minutes weekly to run their program and to answer the odd email here and there .
 all while getting paid full salary and benefits .
 they actually had to add in a few errors now and then to make it seem realistic .
 worked in a local adult education center .
 one of my main tasks was to make calculation about how many people enlisted for a course ,  how many of them got discounts (unemployeds e .
 ) ,  how many men/women/age etc .
 that was needed to calculate upcoming courses fees etc .
 that was my only work there and i hated it .
 this was in early 90s ,  so pcs were a thing in our offices but i had no idea how to write a program or use a database to use this informations .
 lucky as i am our center had an interesting policy: when you want to educate yourself ,  you can attend that class for free .
 and when it &apos;s during the worktime ,  then this is worktime - as long as my supervisor is ok with that .
 so i spent 3 months  &apos;studying &apos; database structures ,  scripting ,  coding etc .
 i told my tutor what i wanna do and he helped me to write a script that grabs all necessary informations from the courses-database ,  copy that into another database and then i went crazy and wrote code that was insane .
 i implemented  &apos;what if &apos; scenarios thanks to filters .
 at the end i was able to do my work ,  that needed 6hrs a day within 15 minuntes .
 i mean ,  before that it took e .
 an hour to have all the necessary informations to have a  &apos;how many unemployed single parent women does it need to make the costs of that course even .
 i had everything back then .
 now you want statistics how many single parent disabled foreign women at the age of 80-90 are needed for the next 2 years to keep the ornithology course running ?
 sure ,  no problem .
 after that ,  i started the pc in the morning ,  grabbed all the data ,  ran my script ,  was done within 15 mins and then read the book i brought from home .
 at the end of the day i gave my supervisor several dozens of papers ,  statistics ,  predictions etc and said  &apos;that was a lot of work !
  &apos; and went home .
 my supervisor was superhappy with me because i did so much more now and was super-effective .
 i worked  &apos;goods in &apos; for an aircraft manufacturer as a summer job at university .
 parts would arrive ,  we &apos;d open them and key in all the details into a terminal .
 that bit was long winded .
 i discovered the terminal keyboard has assignable shortcuts ,  and set up a bunch of them for all the boilerplate such that keying in an item was about six keystrokes .
 saved myself and my workmate hours every day ,  which we would spend pranking each other ,  other warehouse staff and staff at other sites .
 i had a manager in my twenties who detested the fact i turned a two hour process into a fifteen minute process .
  it exposed how much lazier he was compared to me because when the higher ups learned from other people at my level that i created the program ,  they took me aside and told me he took credit for it .
  they asked me how i felt about that .
 i told them what decisions they make regarding the manager &apos;s character is their decision .
  just put yourselves in my shoes and consider it from that angle .
 they did nothing and i took the concept to a competitor who invested the money into making the program more robust and proprietary .
  my name was line one on the patent and trademark documents and i did well enough to semi-retire at 45 .
 i credit lee iacocca for the inspiration .
  he went through a similar problem with higher ups at ford and his answer was to take his brain to chrysler who would value it .
 back in highschool a lot of kids used to walk thru his park to get home/to school .
 a portion of the path went into the woods because it was just quicker than walking the actual trail .
  at one point in the walk through the woods ,   you had to go up this small but tedious hill; nothing major but it took like 10 seconds of hard work to go up it .
  you couldn’t go around because one side was a small cliff to the creek below and other side had dense trees .
  one summer ,  a bunch of us got together and decided to just dig through that hill to make it flat .
  it took like 14 of us 3 good days to get through it .
 it was a hard 3 days but it was definitely worth it .
 saved 10 second of hill climbing every morning and afternoon ,  150+ days of the year .
 and it wasn’t just us ,  but hundreds of other kids who took the same party every day .
 sometimes you need to put in a lot of work so your future selves can enjoy the easy way out .
 i was invited to my friend’s yearly apple picking: it was a full day of apples and kids and filling a truck for cider .
  i’m lazy and suggested we make the process more efficient with tarps on the ground .
  we managed in 2 hours what historically took all day .
  we didn’t even get to the picnic lunch .
  essentially ,  i ruined apple picking
 in every job i &apos;ve ever had these things make your day far less labor intensive if used correctly .
 in australia explorers discovered a mountain that was taller than mt kosciuszko ,  which was though to be the tallest mountain in australia .
 rather then cause confusion by telling everyone a new tallest mountain had been found ,  they simply named the new mountain mt kosciuszko and renamed the original to something else .
 i have a massive exercise to do at our year end (accountancy) .
 my work previously got checked by another manager who spent over 3 weeks going over the data .
 eventually she got shifted to another department and that workload fell on me ,  basically self audit and then present the data to the actual auditors .
 my previous manager was absolutely shit at excel .
 i didn &apos;t let on but i did all the audit on a separate file using simple (but out of the way) formulas .
 not only did i reduce the task from 3 weeks to basically real time checks (no time) but when i was told that i have to perform that exercise every month my job became a doddle .
 i didn &apos;t let on that everything was automated by sumifs ,  indexing ,  max values and range checks .
 living the dream .
 (sorry if i rambled on .
 at work ,  i go through parts and apply 2 different kinds or tape and 2 different kinds of weave .
 i have finally got the rhythm down and now i do each part individually ,  and apply everything at once .
 everyone else goes through an entire order ,  just applying tape ,  then goes through it again to do the weave .
 i asked to use the big table in the back of the shop ,  and just put all the tape and weave tools there .
 and do the parts all at once .
 normal rate for an 8hr shift is 1200 ,  but i can manage 1800 in a day ,  going at a nice steady pace .
 i can get 1800 going at a steady pace .
 i &apos;ve done it before .
 but i usually dont .
 most days i go slow and relax ,  purposely only making 1300-1350 or so parts .
 it &apos;s just enough over rate to get my incentive bonus .
 and ,  thanks to being a  &apos;hard and fast &apos; worker ,  the uppers leave me alone at my big table in the back .
 they look the other way when i have an earbud in one ear ,  and they don &apos;t notice that i scroll reddit or read a lot .
 i can &apos;t say what products we make ,  they &apos;re too recognizable and googling it would reveal where i work and live .
 i knew a guy who had a low level data/reporting job .
 he had several daily/weekly work responsibilities ,  including a bunch of reports that needed quite a bit of tweaking from raw data to finished product .
 but like i said ,  low level .
 we didn &apos;t find out until way later ,  but he had set up macros for each of his major responsibilities where he could .
 once set up ,  he &apos;d just run the macros to do his work ,  but then he &apos;d (smartly) hold off on delivering the reports until just a little before the deadlines .
 he &apos;d hit every assignment and was seen as reliable .
 he also would complain about the workload so people would leave him with that work .
 i doubt he did a full hour of work a day after he set up what he did .
 eventually he left the job for one with better pay .
 but damn did he work lazy .
 also ,  he was smart not to reveal until the end ,  because had he told them about it he would have gotten a pat on the back and would have been given a whole other workload ,  on top of maintaining those macros/etc .
 dude milked the job ,  not the other way around .
 i automate shit all the time at work to make daily routine jobs more easy .
 i write manuals with screenshots with arrows indicating where to click or where to fill in what .
 whenever i write a manual ,  i assume that whoever reads it is a complete idiot so that whenever customers call for the same questions again ,  i just send them to the online manual i created .
 no need to type it  out again by email or explain it again by phone .
 does alexander and the gordian knot count ?
  &apos;a complex knot that ,  according to prophecy ,  was to be undone only by the person who was to rule asia ,  and that was cut ,  rather than untied ,  by alexander the great .
 my boss put my name in for leading a project group shortly after i joined the company .
 i had no experience whatsoever about project managing yet he still demanded that i lead the group of 12 people .
 all way smarter guys (tech background and shit ,  these guys are like magicians for me) and with way more time at the company .
 i’m a business guy who’s too dumb for balance sheets that’s why i’m in hr (and because i quite like the field the most) .
 so we started the first meeting ,  i asked for everyone’s plan ,  experience and ideas ,  gathered the different pros and cons ,  cross checked with the budget we had ,  put on a time frame with milestones to reach (around 6 months) ,  put in valuable people to consult at different steps .
 why did i do that ?
 because i like organizing stuff and keep everyone on the same page and delegate to-dos .
 got promoted because of the success of the project .
 i asked my boss why he put me in for it since i never done anything like that .
 he said because i complained in the first week that most of the work has way too wonky structure ,  no clear guideline and this could be improved heavily if we just take some time into it .
 and because i hated talking to others if i had questions and i wouldn’t get a clear answer (like: ask 10 people the same question and you get 15 different answers) .
 in the long run this would make us way more efficient and keeps everyone on the same page .
 all because i hated disorganized work .
 years ago as a student i got a job stocking shelves .
  guys were carrying the heavy boxes ,  put them on the floor and bend each time to pick up the items to put on the shelves .
  i was maybe a light 100 pounds (woman) and carrying the boxes was just killing me physically .
  so one day i had an idea .
  i put the box on a old desk chair and rolled it around .
  no more carrying and no more bending !
   funny thing is that ,  instead of doing the same thing ,  most of the guys called me lazy and kept carrying the heavy boxes .
  just to prove how strong they were .
 now they have special rolling carts to do the job .
 the entire micellaneous kitchen tools section at bed ,  bath ,  and beyond .
 i don &apos;t need an avocado slicer or a lemon squeezer or an automatic chopper/dicer ,  but lazy old me definitely puts them to good use .
 this is a case of ask a lazy person for a solution to handling their work; .
 i got sent out to california on a fact finding mission about the marijuana growing industry (years ago) to see if there was a market for the sort of a&c work we do (automation & controls) .
 i set up meetings with some of the local growers and met with them ,  discussed their outdoor grow operations .
 their biggest complaint was having to go to the grow sites to do various tasks associated with maintaining the crop .
 i asked them;  &apos;if we could provide a system that could allow you to manage those operations remotely from home ,  would you be interested in buying it ?
 every single guy was like  &apos;fuck yeah ,  if i can do it from bed while smoking a spliff i &apos;d be totally on board for that ,  that &apos;s like my dream come true !
 so it turns out some of the automation that was developed for that industry was marketed to the inherent laziness of stoners who have an entrepreneurial spirit .
 my brother gave  my oldest nephew 10 dollars a week if he did all his chores with out needing to be told or complaining .
 one day he gets home early from work and sees .
 the neighbor kid tossing a bag in the trash .
   he asks him what he is doing and the kid says he gets 5 bucks a week to take care of a few chores .
 my nephew outsourced his chores .
 well i worked in a graphics design studio as an intern .
 they mostly had me practice and do some basic stuff their head designers was to busy to do .
 one was a real estate add .
 it had a few basic templates ,  but it was all kinds of scatterbrained .
 i would spend 5-10 minutes trying to find the right layer for all the pictures ,  and had to mess with way too much .
 so i made copies of the files ,  and made one for each template .
 i labeled everything ,  made it so the images on top of each other wouldn’t clip into the lower ones like the previous did .
 you could be in and out of the template in 2-3 minutes .
 showed my boss the difference ,  and he had this face of “well shit .
 ” he said the next day that if i was a graduate he’d hire me ,  because i was better than the people sending applications in .
 in short i made an overly complicated/unorganized thing the opposite ,  and my boss was actually sad he couldn’t hire me .
 i had to carry groceries into the house when i was a kid .
 i didn’t want to make multiple trips ,  so i tied several bags to the belt loops on my pants to do it in one trip .
 i &apos;m doing it right now ,  automated data cleaning in python .
 my coworkers don &apos;t know about it ,  so something that takes me 10 mins at most takes them 2 hours .
 for everyone who says i should share my code ,  i have .
 i even set up a private github space for my team .
 some have taken it up ,  but others (including management) do not like it .
 i think they feel a little threatened .
 i worked for the state doing data entry of a sort - we got scans of forms that people had filled out ,  and we had to go through and make sure the numbers that the computer had pulled from the scan matched what was written ,  since it wasn &apos;t entirely accurate .
 so ,  the software we used showed us all the scanned documents ,  and overlaid fields right next to any point where the scanner found numbers ,  with the number the machine determined was written already in the field .
 the job was essentially looking at each field and making sure the number right next to it was the same - if it wasn &apos;t ,  fix it .
 we didn &apos;t fuck with any of the text ,  it was just the numbers .
 now ,  these scans included all of the paperwork submitted by each person ,  including like a dozen pages with no data whatsoever ,  it was just the beginning of the document that the person read before they filled out the actual forms and stuff .
 there was also a section just after the middle that was several more pages of information for the person .
 my trainer showed me how to do all this - he accepted a new document from the queue ,  and pressed the down arrow key to scroll through the beginning section until he got to the first field .
 he made sure the numbers matched and repeated this process for several minutes ,  before excusing himself and telling me i could come grab him if i had any questions .
 i sat down at the computer ,  and took a look around the room .
 literally every screen i could see from where i was sitting ,  people were actively scrolling .
 some were using mousewheel ,  most used the down arrow .
 i accepted a new document from the queue ,  and i pushed the tab button .
 the program instantly brought me to the first field a dozen pages down .
 i smirked to myself ,  compared the field to the written text ,  and repeated that process instead .
 i did go back and scroll through that first document to ensure i hadn &apos;t missed anything due to a goof in the software or anything like that .
 near the end of my second day ,  i was called into my bosses &apos; office and asked what i &apos;d been doing the past two days .
 turns out ,  as of day two ,  i was churning through five or six times the amount of documents a day compared to people who &apos;d been working there for years .
 my boss assumed i was just clicking through new documents without doing any work and was very much acting like he had caught me red-handed .
 i asked if they reviewed the documents i finished to ensure that i &apos;d done the work .
 he replied that they hadn &apos;t ,  but ,  it was obviously impossible to go through that many pages in the time it took me to do it .
 i told him that i knew for a fact that if he went through any of my work ,  he &apos;d see everything was fine .
 he pulled one of my finished documents at random ,  and spent several minutes scrolling through it ,  shaking his head to himself ,  staring daggers at the screen .
 he admitted that this document was fine ,  but ,  it would take hours for his assistant manager to review all my work .
  &apos;can i show you something ?
 could you please pull up another random document of mine ?
 he rolled his eyes ,  but ,  he did it .
 i stood up from my chair ,  came around the desk ,  and i hit tab .
 he was looking at the screen like it was witchcraft ,  i showed him the field matched ,  and tabbed my way through the rest of the fields ,  confirming the rest of the numbers as i did .
 i finished reviewing the whole document with him in less than a minute .
 he asked me if my trainer showed me that .
 i replied that he hadn &apos;t ,  but ,  it was a universal keyboard shortcut that i &apos;d been using since the early 90 &apos;s - this happened in 2013 ,  btw .
 he just looked at me for a bit ,  and then said he had to talk to his assistant manager about the whole thing ,  before asking me to go back to work .
 later ,  i &apos;m heading out at the end of the day when my boss asks me to come over to his office .
 he fires me for  &apos;not taking the job seriously &apos; and  &apos;potentially causing delays to taxpayers due to inaccuracies .
  &apos; i actually laughed at him after he got done with his spiel .
 and that &apos;s the story of how i managed to flummox several state employees with a highly controversial use of the tab button .
 still blows my mind .
 a few years back my sister was doing some hardware testing and validation .
 she was working with a bunch of excel tables .
 when she found out that i was doing some automatic xls creating/editing for my job she had me create a script for her job .
 2-3 days of eye-killing boring work done in 20 seconds .
 she kept it a secret for a while .
 the worst task became the best task .
 she eventually shared it with the company as there were many others that did a similar job .
 and then she got promoted .
 in conclusion her lazynes helped with her promotion
 according to facebook parents: the fucker that carved a sphere out of a stone block and rolled it instead of pushing it like the other dudes .
 water is super lazy and will literally find the easiest way to go anywhere every single time
 an engineer spent hours developing a program so they could start the coffee pot from their desk and not have to wait for coffee when arriving in the break room .
 my ex-boss gave me an excel sheet .
 000 rows excel sheet .
 had all the company customer data per row - twice .
 in some of those duplicates there was an error .
 she needed me to go over the list one row by row to check for mistakes and mark all the faulty entries i could find .
 she wanted me to do that using the arrow-down key and my mouse .
 invested half an hour into google .
 copy pasted some parts of this formula ,  then some parts of that .
 finally i had figured out the formula .
 i double clicked the tiny rectangle so that the formula gets applied on all rows .
 worked like a charm .
 i stood up ,  got myself a coffee ,  talked to some colleagues .
 then i went to my boss .
 she had anticipated that i would need 3 days for this task .
 when i was back less than an hour later ,  she thought i hadn &apos;t understood the task or maybe a follow up question .
 i will never forget the expression on her face when i told her i was done .
 there were 6 faulty entries .
 (a year and a half later i enrolled into computer science at university where i will finish my undergrad this summer : )
 i don &apos;t know if this is a true story ,  but kind of fits your request .
 there was a manufacturing plant that made toothpaste .
 one year for some reason there ended up being an unusually high number of empty boxes being shipped out .
 so in order to stop that from happening the head of the company hired a couple engineers to develope a system to catch any empty boxes so they didn &apos;t get shipped with the boxes that actually had the toothpaste tubes in them .
 the engineers developed a system that if the box weighed below a certain amount the system would stop and a worker would have to go remove the box and start everything up again .
 the person in charge loved the idea and implemented it immediately .
 and right from the get go the number of empty boxes shipped dropped to near zero .
 the head of the company wanted to go see the system in action so he goes and visits the plant one day and notices a huge fan right by the assembly line .
 very confused as it wasn &apos;t hot he asked the plant manager why the fan was there .
 the plant manager said the workers were tired of stopping what they were doing to remove an empty box so they just hooked up a fan to blow the empty boxes off the scale before the system recognized it was empty and shut everything off .
 so laziness led to a more efficient (and cost effective) plan .
 every year in the canadian winter ,  powerlines would fail due to the weight of the snow .
 it took many days to build up enough to break a line so they employed a team to walk the routes and shake the poles to loosen the snow .
 one day they saw a bear shaking the poles and realized that if they could get the bear to do it they wouldn &apos;t need to walk the route .
 so they gave one guy a bucket of honey and he &apos;d walk the route painting the sides of the poles with honey to attract the bears .
 it worked for a few more years but this still takes a lot of time to do .
 so then they had the idea of flying a helicopter along the route with a trained sniper with honey paintballs that he &apos;d shoot the poles with .
 on its maiden flight the helicopter passed the lines and the downdraft blew away all of the snow .
 the flights continue to this day but without the sniper .

 my greenhouse &apos;s watering system .
 i would spend an hour per day watering the garden .
 30 hours per month .
 so for $50 ,  i setup a pvc watering system in a few hours .
 now i just turn on the spigot and watch while i smoke a joint .
 the guy that fixed the track link problem on russian t-34 tanks .
 instead of redesigning the tracks or track links he slapped some metal at the side of the tank for the links to get pushed back into place .
 programming away work is the real life example of this .
 i worked with a guy ,  ethan ,  who unfortunately was kind of scapegoated for the failure of a project so was let go but he was definitely capable .
  a year later the company i worked for was sold off and eventually shuttered .
  while looking for new work i spoke with a recruiter who had also worked with the ethan and he mentioned how he got was trying to find him a new position too as he had a contract job to digitize and update old mechanical drawings to the companies new software .
  apparently he wrote a bunch of macros and set up a work flow and was able to complete the work within a month even though the contract was for 6 months .
  the company let him go since the work was done and had no intentions of keeping him on .
 my wife and i have a chore list .
 i now am tasked with vacuuming which she gloated about not having to do because it is so time consuming .
 i bought a roomba and now the house is cleaner than ever and all i have to do is press a button on my phone .
 polymerase chain reaction .
 pcr changed bio and medical sciences more than any other breakthrough in modern times and it came about because a scientist wanted to surf more so he figured out how to do a full-time lab job in just a few hours a week .
 i mean the original quote was made by frank b .
 gilbreth after watching  &apos;lazy &apos; brick layers move more efficiently ,  so .
 in construction environments it &apos;s quite common to have a  &apos;soft &apos; foreman/men underneath the actually person in charge .
 you basically find the individuals you know want to work their way up and give them components of the work and however many people they need - they &apos;ll do it because often times it means less physical work for them .
 you &apos;re still ultimately signing off on their work or settling debates/etc .
 which makes you the ultimate foreman or supervisor ,  but you know that you can assigned the task and they &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done and everyone is keeping the schedule in mind .
 i used to work in it doing tech support for the employees .
 we didn &apos;t have a process for keeping track of what programs and hardware each employee pc used .
 so if someone had to replace a pc you had to remote into their old one to get their programs ,  shared folders ,  and hardware .
 if their old pc died you had to hope they knew what they needed .
 i made an easy single page sheet to track the user ,  the pc specs ,  programs ,  and hardware they use .
 now you just need to copy what is on the sheet when setting up a new computer
 a lazy programmer will think all the possible ways of doing a single simple task
 i remember reading about a texas airport that had a high rate of complaints from people who had to wait a long time for their luggage at baggage claim .
 the solution: assign a further away baggage claim for the same flights .
 people walked longer ,  but complaints went way down since they didn &apos;t have to wait as long .
 i asked my husband to take out roughly a dumpsters worth of trash .
 he spent about an hour building a sled out of the trash ,  and took it out in one go .
 laziest man i &apos;ve ever met
 i created mainframe automation so that if there was a problem ,  i would get paged in my boss’s office where i played doom for hours on end .
 oh and browsed newsgroups .
 sure i could do that thing ,  or i could write a script and get it automated .
 i worked in a library scanning incoming books into the system .
 this required a lot of transferring of piles of books from one station to another .
 my work mate constantly called me lazy because i would not get out of my chair while doing this job .
 i don &apos;t know how many times i had to explain (a) that &apos;s what wheely chairs are for ,  and (b) i was at least three times as fast as her at the same job and this was in part because of the efficiency of not getting up out of my chair every two minutes .
 i am presently printing and wiring a safety switch that will disable my lathe when the chuck key is removed .
 it is a rule that the chuck key will never be in the chuck whilst any other activity is occurring other than tightening the chuck .
 whilst i have never yet forgotten to remove the key ,  i decided that to ensure it is never left in the chuck ,  the machine will never start with the key removed from the switch .
 back in my it consulting days working at an msp ,  we had a client with about 180 users who needed new pc &apos;s prepped and ready to go for a round of new hires when they were expanding their workforce .
  they were adding 40 employees and thus needed 40 workstations prepped .
 i was assigned the ticket and my boss quoted them 80 hours of work (2h per pc) .
 the standard procedure my boss had set up back then was a 3 page checklist to run through for each pc ,  what software was needed for which group ,  reminders for installing update s since dell workstations out of the box aren &apos;t always current with updates ,  and more .
 basically it was a terribly long ,  arduous ,  manual approach to windows deployment .
 so instead of  following the standard procedure ,  i decided i was going to automate it all .
 the first 2 days unboxed 1 pc ,  prepped it with all the basic items needed for all workstations and then cloned it to another pc .
 day 3 i built off of the first image i created which had some more specialized software for a specific subgroup of these new hires .
 once that was complete ,  i was ready to deploy .
 i configured the  &apos;wds &apos; (windows deployment server) role and had everything ready to go .
 i brought in a 24 port switch ,  hooked all pc &apos;s up for 2 rounds of 20 deployments ,  and on day 4 ,  by lunch ,  i had all workstations complete .
 all the while my bosses kept checking in to see what was up and why i only had 2 pcs prepped as of the end of day 3 .
 after lunch on day 4 ,  i called to check in and informed them the job was complete .
 their response was  to have me just hang out at the clients office for the next week or so which gave me a decent amount of downtime back then to work on things i wanted to .
 did you really say that ,  /u/thisisbillgates ?
 i am a real life example of this .
  &apos;wow you do amazing work you must work so hard !
 step 1 of any new job/task is work flow efficiency .
 but i let them continue to think i &apos;m busting my ass while i surf reddit .
 you know it was a lazy fucker who came up with the idea to have localized mail boxes in each neighborhood instead of individual boxes on each home .
 anyone mention the dude who turned a ship &apos;s course because the sun was in his eyes ?
 my friend applied for a job at company that works on autonomously driving systems for cars .
 during the interview he was asked whether likes cars .
 his answer was that he absolutely hates to drive .
 he got the job .
 me ,  one time i asked my boss  &apos;seriously ,  why do you always toss me the difficult tasks ?
  &apos; and he replied  &apos;because i know you &apos;ll get it done quick so you can get your ass back on reddit &apos;
 when peter the great was building st petersburg there was a huge boulder needed removing as it was in the way of a road .
  lots of contractors tendered for the job .
 the would use explosives to start ,  smash it into smaller pieces using sledgehammers and then cart them away .
 a local peasant also put in an offer for half the price .
 they gave him the job .
 he and a few friends dug a large hole next to it ,  took away the excess earth ,  tipped the boulder in and covered it up with the remaining earth .
 i used to animate graphics for those led signs at certain popular fast food chains .
 there would sometimes be a library of 80-120 6 second videos that need resized or scaled down .
 i figured out how to make a system macro that memorize some of my mouse clicks and keyboard strokes and it automated a previously 4 hour task into something i could hit one button and start sketching out ideas for other projects .
 before it was shut down entirely ,  i was able to privately tour the coal power plant in southeastern virginia .
 at one point in the tour ,  the guide told me to watch out for a cord on the floor .
 the cord ran to a small ,  window air-conditioning unit that was duct-taped to a vent .
 supposedly ,  one day the plant began to overheat ,  and the plant would have to be shut down in order to repair the malfunction .
 there are emergency reserves for situations like this ,  but the plant was overheating faster than they could switch it over .
 someone at the plant had just purchased the ac unit ,  and had it in the back of their vehicle .
 the ran and grabbed it ,  plugged it in ,  and pointed it into one of the vents .
 the amount of cool air it produced was enough to not only offset the overheating ,  but to also re-regulate the system ,  so instead of repairing the issue ,  they just fixed the the ac in place ,  and let it run continuously until the day the plant shut down .
 at my last job ,  a truck suspension shop ,  we did inventory every december and it was someone &apos;s job to count all the washers and screws of every size .
 it was my first inventory and i casually mentioned that they should just weigh 10 screws or washers ,  then weigh them all and divide the weight to get the count .
 everyone looked at me like i had given them the key to the universe .
 counting washers and screws went from a day or two ,  to just a an hour .
 it is the king of this .
  we have set up scripts to do tons of tasks for reporting and data manipulation automatically .
  we have been using one macro program for years that works flawless most of the time .
  it can recognize windows and screens and you can tell it to do about anything .
  its called macro express .
  way back in the days when farmville was big on facebook ,  you had to harvest these fields ,  and if you found a pineapple field ,  you could make bank .
 it was a grid of squares and you had to click each square to harvest it ,  and sometimes other players would jump in and start harvesting too .
  i wrote a macro on a hot key that when i found a full field to harvest ,  it would take the mouse cursor ,  move and click every single square in the grid ,  so once it was claimed ,  no one else could harvest it .
  it would click the entire grid in about 5 seconds ,  where if you were doing it manually ,  it would take you about 30 seconds .
  i &apos;ve also used it for voting websites before they implemented measures to only allow one vote per ip address .
  you can do all sorts of things if you want to put in the time to perfect your script .
 basically every invention in the last 100 years is an example of how to accomplish a task with much less effort .
 the automobile being the first one that comes to mind .
 i personally use the  &apos;talk-to-text &apos; feature on my phone to get it to write essays for me .
 i just talk about what i want it to write and then tweak the grammar errors later .
 work smarter ,  not harder
 i use to work at car dealership parts department and most repetitively strokes for the same product like oil changes and such .
 made a keystroke shortcut .
 now as a forklift driver at a costco i try to make sure there is something alwys on my forks going in or out of aisle .
 unlike other drivers they don’t .
 that common sense though .
 im glad people like me have value in this world ,  i would have never known otherwise
 a computer algorithm arranged my work driving route .
 it looked at physical location on a grid without considering roads ,  rivers ,  etc .
 just direct distance .
 it was godawful ,  lots of unnecessary cul-de-sacing ,  stuck on one-way trips with a ton of deadhead travel back ,  etc .
 there was no rhyme or reason ,  a giant looping circuitous mess that drove past stops ,  returning to them later ,  and doubling back everywhere .
 i spent the first weekend redoing it by hand ,  specifically to make it as efficient as possible so i can relax between stops to talk to clients casually or just sit in parking lots and do fuck all .
 before the pandemic added a bunch of new stops ,  i would take all the time i needed ,  a long lunch break ,  and still always made it to drop off ahead of schedule .
 i &apos;m exceptionally lazy .
 past me did an hour of work on google maps to save me hours and hours over the last two years .
 spl in scouts ,  doing a trail clean up .
 quite a large amount of larger limbs ,  thinner trunks .
 like eye aspens or w/e they’re called .
 we had a big boi ,  even for a teen ,  talking over 6ft and over 200 at the least .
 he was the type to only carry one thing but use two hands because he was self pronounced as lazy .
 put him on the assignment of limb and trunk removal .
 he used a timber hitch ,  and would clear the trail 3-4 limbs or trunks at a time .
 he loved it because he “just had to tie a knot and walk .
 ” and freed up like 3 more scouts for other work .
 we made great pace .
 in my teens i started working at a local grocery store and was hired in the deli/bakery dept .
 every morning 1 person made salads ,  2 people brewed the fresh gallon sweet tea and 2 people created/prepped the deli counter ready-to-go meals .
 one week we had a bad flu case hit us and we were severely short on staff .
 i grabbed a grocery cart and started brewing tea .
 while it brewed i made the salads .
 instead of taking each gallon tea to the other side of the store 1 at a time i would place them in the grocery cart and continue brewing and stacking till the cart was full (because fuck walking back and forth) .
 usually by the time it was full i was finished with all morning prep and was able to help the cook make breakfast and prep for lunch .
 the manager saw this and turned it into my full job in the morning .
 unfortunately for my co-workers most were then  &apos;let go &apos; .
 i only knew of 1 who was lucky enough to be moved to another job in the store .
 i ended up leaving shortly after due to the backlash .
 tldr; i did the job equivalent of 5 people by being able to multi-task with only a shopping cart and accidentally ruining others jobs .
 when i was about 7-10 years old my dad used to pay me to ‘self sit .
 ’ basically instead of having to get a baby sitter on short notice and then pay them like $100 ,  he told me that i would get $30 if i stayed in my room and didn’t speak to my older sister for 3 hours .
 he then told my sister that she was the “baby sitter” and she would get $30 if nothing bad happened
  in 1927 my grandfather started his new job at dupont on a friday .
  his first assignment was to separate out a chemical that was suspended in another chemical .
  he was handed a beaker of the stuff to work on .
  since it was late on a friday afternoon ,  he did nothing with it ,  just stuck it on a shelf and went home .
  he came back monday morning to discover that the chemical had precipitated out and was sitting on the bottom of the beaker .
  he showed this to his new boss ,  who decided my grandfather was a genius .
  this process (doing nothing to the suspension) became the first of my grandfather &apos;s 47 patents .
 my girlfriend will kill me for this but fuck it .
  i hate taking a finished toilet paper roll downstairs to throw it out .
  me just leaving the empty roll in the bathroom annoys the crap out of my girlfriend so i developed this strategy when there was only a few sheets left ,  i &apos;d start using sheets from a new roll and leave the old roll with sheets still on it .
  that way ,  she &apos;d always be the one to finish the roll and have to take the empty one downstairs .
 for people asking why i don &apos;t just use the bathroom rubbish bin ,  we recycle our cardboard .
 i work at a company which ,  despite having a 100+ employees ,  doesn &apos;t seem to have 1 that knows more then basics when it comes to computers .
 due to the pandemic we &apos;ve all taken up some chores to clock some hours .
 they &apos;ve got me  &apos;re-typing &apos; pdf read only files to a new word file .
 thus far they havent figured out you can just export a pdf file to  .
 but my schedule is now 1/3 cleared to do  &apos;typing &apos; work .
 pushing a button on your controller to turn on your console .
 the way linux went about protecting accounts from brute force guessing passwords .
 since those attacks rely on trying a gazillion passwords ,  they just added a delay between each try .
 effectively limiting the number of differents passwords you can try in a reasonable time frame .
 since then it &apos;s the de facto way of going about it .
 years ago while working at my uncle &apos;s warehouse there was a monthly shipment of double doors with the frame built in .
 these doors were so heavy that it was a five to six man job to get them off the truck and walking them though a narrow enough hallway; this process could kill 2 hours of sales because the place had a crew of ten men and with 6 being needed it was known to avoid shopping there on those days .
 have no idea how long they did this but on the second shipment when i started; i got one of those rolling boards that mechanics use to go under cars and told the guys to place it on top .
 i turned a 6 man job with 2 hours to a 2 man job that took 30 mins .
 haha ,  i did this during the start of the pandemic with paper towels on an empty shelf (thanks covid panic buyers) .
 instead of opening the box of single roll paper towels and placing them on the shelf ,  i just cut off the bottom of the box and slid the rolls right out .
 as someone who has never worked in a supermarket ,  i have a hard time picturing this .
 i need a diagram :(
 i wouldn &apos;t call that lazy so much as an intelligent use of the technology at hand .
 learning and utilizing technology is probably a much better lesson learned than whatever the particular maths problems he was working on !
 that is precisely what engineering is .
 aerospace engineers are especially lazy .
 yeah they could walk to the moon ,  but nooooo .
 finally ,  a non- computer story
 how to fix his sagging deck .
 i read this as something completely different
 my favorite math teacher used to say that the best solution is the one you find .
 and yet i get in trouble and have my calculator taken away because i automate all of the crappy repetitive work .
 simplify radicals of any power with any scalar ?
 potentially 20 minutes of work for big numbers of factoring ,  and dozens of trial and error all across the board .
 a script on a ti-84 earns you a non-scientific calculator to do all your math with by the end of the year ,  though .
 what i &apos;m getting from this thread is i should learn excel and how to automate stuff
 smart ,  he used a machine that counts as one of its functions ,  but not the primary function ,  to do the counting for him .
 it &apos;s just enough outside of the box that most people wouldn &apos;t think to do it at all .
 opposite end of the spectrum ,   i once caught our hr lady messing around with the copier .
 she was pushing a bunch of buttons and swearing and scanning a blank ,  light blue page .
 i asked what she was doing .
 she was trying to create blue paper .
 from our black and white printer .
 so i opened the drawer of the cabinet next to her ,  and pointed at the light blue stock paper .
 i used to do that in university at the end of the semester .
  doggonit i paid for those printing credits and i &apos;m gonna use them !
  so i print off 200 empty sheets every time i go to the computer lab and take them home to feed my printer there .
 work smarter not harder .
 and be a genius ,  let &apos;s not forget the most important part here
 as a developer at least ,  it’s quite common that everything you create at work belongs to the company .
 so make sure your script doesnt belong to them before you try and start a business with it .
 you should let the client know they could save 300k$ a year
 i wish i had this gift to be inquisitive about number patterns .
 i don’t trust or follow my instincts enough in maths .
 when i taught math ,  my favorite bonus on a test ever was the  &apos;four 4 &apos;s &apos; activity .
 using exactly four 4 &apos;s and normal operations (including factorials) ,  you can produce all the numbers 1 to 100 .
 i once gave my 7th graders the bonus ,  with the challenge of finding all the results 1-10 .
 most fiddled with it ,  got a number or two ,  and gave up .
 i had this one kid who had horrendous adhd and he did all of them .
 he was so smart ,  he just needed a challenge .
 okay ,  story time cause why not .
 a few months later he was kicked out (a long ,  dramatic story involving a toy gun ,  and the absolute right call on admin &apos;s part) and he never came back .
 i was crushed for him .
 our school was a private school that worked with promising students from low-income backgrounds ,  and we were a much better school than the surrounding public schools .
 i never heard another thing about him .
 six years later ,  i found out from one of our alum that he had been accepted into the posse foundation and was going to an elite school in the midwest .
 made my whole year .
 talent not wasted .
 my teacher did this in 8th grade ,  but i used 0 plus 100 ,  1 plus 99 ,  2 plus 98 ,  etc .
 50 pairs of 100 plus 50 all alone in the middle .
 05 seems adequate for saving 3 hours each time 
 why did no one think of this before ?
 lmao like how long were they tediously doing this with tongs before you came along ?
 dave attell is hilarious .
 i &apos;ve been trying to find his late night series from the early 2000s ,  but don &apos;t know where to look
 trip the main fuse in the house at midnight to do all the appliances too lol .
 my granddad puts a battery in a stopped clock in at the exact time it stopped so he doesnt have to tweak it .
 is a very specific type of person .
 i’m glad to learn you exist .
 pleased to meet you .
 my husband is absolutely the better cook in our household and i will readily admit that .
 when i make scrambled eggs ,  i break the eggs into the pan and stir them around/break the yolks with my spatula .
 he admonishes me about beating the eggs in a bowl first to “properly emulsify” them .
 they get plenty scrambled my way and i don’t have a bowl to wash .
 an older company had a person dedicated to “data entry” which boiled down to copying and pasting portions of data from text files into spreadsheet and formatting into a report .
 i &apos;ve worked a few places that have people doing this .
 usually when they retire ,  the job is given to some younger person that figures out how to do it in 10 minutes on top of the rest of their normal job .
 almost this exact same thing happened to me .
 i got a part time job doing data entry at a local university .
 since i was also a student my hours were flexible ,  nights/weekends ,  unsupervised as long as the work got done .
 they wanted their database converted from a really old system from the 80s into the then current microsoft access database .
 they printed out reams and reams of paper and told me to manually enter them in the new database by hand .
 i asked why they didn &apos;t just import and they said the formats weren &apos;t compatible .
 i didn &apos;t believe that so i got my hands on the original database files and took about a day figuring out how to manipulate the files so i could import them directly into access .
 it was the first time i &apos;d ever used any kind of database or spreadsheet software in my life ,  so most of that was just spent learning about the software and how imports and data fields worked ,  today i could probably do the same in under an hour .
 spent the next several months getting paid to play video games while importing the data in batches to make it look like gradual progress .
 currently in the year 2020 i’m confident that any task being done anywhere in the world on any computer that is repetitive and time consuming could pretty easily be automated .
 people will always try to make their job easier but any competent manager should be able to weed this out .
 made yourself more efficient and use the extra time to make your colleagues less efficient ?
 some future railroad surveyors right here .
 did something a bit like that 30 years ago .
 steep slope on a loop walk near my house .
 carried a spade up a hill and dug some steps out to make a short cut .
 now an official path where there wasn´t one before .
 somewhere near here: .
  what did the tarp do to save time ?
 i was delivering a pop up bar to a fancy hotel and they had a bunch of japanese delegates staying for the event .
 one of the guys went up to his room about 2am and ran himself a bath .
 he fell asleep .
 when we came to pick up the bars the roof over the reception was leaking and the receptionist explained the story .
 they put out a bucket and cones and every time we took stuff out to our van it got worse and worse .
 (lath and plaster ceiling) i suggested they get a tarp under that thing to save time cleaning up when it all falls in .
 we even got to see the walk of shame when their bus arrived !
 i did a version of this to my elderly neighbor on accident .
 her two middle school aged grandchildren came over to help her rake leaves and i offered to let them use my blower .
 what was going to be an all-day job took less than an hour .
 the kids were thrilled to get to use power tools and be done so quickly and went inside to watch tv .
 grandma returned the blower and gave me a thank you with the saddest eyes i’d ever seen .
 that’s when i realized she wanted to spend the beautiful fall day outside with her grandkids .
 anyway ,  sorry about that jenny .
 that &apos;s how i trim my bushes .
 fuck raking and bagging .
 i put tarps around the base of the bush .
 the leaves and branches fall onto them and i just pull them up by the corners and empty them out in our yard waste bin .
 good god ,  i wish we had these things .
 spent 20 minutes of my coffee break at 3 am trying to call the plant in an area with next to no service so they could let me in the building because my dumbass left my wallet inside .
 didn &apos;t get my coffee either .
 plus it’s just fun saying stuff like “roger that” and “over and out”
 thanks i like this story and i also feel sad for the cd tray reaching out for the button that was no longer there .
 i think i would &apos;ve dynamited the top off the new mountain .
 but are you paid by the part ?
 everyone else goes through an entire order ,  just applying tape ,  then goes through it again to do the weave .
 honestly that seems like it &apos;d be faster ,  but i don &apos;t totally understand what the weave and tape are for in the example i guess .
 i know a guy who did this ,  but he revealed it .
 the company shared the macros with all the employees .
 it made everyone &apos;s life easier ,  but they also got an increased work load .
 the company made a lot more money .
 and this guy made none of it .
 he didn &apos;t even get promoted .
 i created a macro which did data entry into an as400 system from excel .
 100% accurate and 100 times faster !
 i never gave this information up .
   it saved me so many hours .
   i kept it quiet .
 near the end of my career there i started helping coworkers ,  and productivity went thru the roof .
 needless to say ,  no raises for the department ,  so i basically left ,  and left with the macro .
 i still have contacts there ,  and its been 12+ years since i left .
   they still talk about  &apos;the productivity levels of 2008 &apos; and try to blame  &apos;the recession &apos;
 any good it guy will find a way to automate his job so he can sit around browsing reddit .
  i left my last sys admin job and the next guy called me and asked how i was doing the work of 3 people .
  he was going through the daily playbook and was so far behind .
 i asked him if he was going through the manual play book ,  or the automated playbook ,  as i had left both on my desk .
  evidently my former boss had taken the automated one to do the work in the interim and never told the new hire about it .
 this is the day-to-day working life of anyone who has ever been the only person in their office who knows how to code .
 when i was 20 ,  i had a part-time student-work position that involved managing the website at a small organization .
 one of my tasks was to update the landing page every day with the date ,  a little thing about the day ( &apos;happy international women &apos;s day &apos; or  &apos;today is nelson mandela &apos;s birthday &apos; or whatever) an inspirational quote ,  and a link to a random article from our archives .
 the person who &apos;d had the task before me was editing the html by hand every day .
 it wasn &apos;t a big task ,  but it was blocked out in my schedule for 8am to 8:30am every morning .
 within the first week ,  i &apos;d built a very simple database and script .
 it took about 2 hours total ,  and then for the whole three years i worked there ,  i had half an hour in the morning to just drink coffee and browse the internet until the script pushed the update live automatically at 8:30 .
 this is one tiny innocuous example among many from my own experience ,  and i &apos;m certain anyone who knows even basic programming and has worked in an office has a dozen or more similar stories of their own .
 reminds me of the mysterious firewall issue that verizon discovered .
 they noticed that there was a strange vpn connection from china every day from around 9-5 .
 this triggered an internal security audit which was unable to determine how the hacker was getting in .
 they eventually decided to roll out physical security keys to make the vpn more secure .
 this had the desired effect and the illicit connections stopped .
 for around one week .
 then they mysteriously started again .
 their network team was baffled as to how this apparent hacker had penetrated their more secure setup .
 so they called in an external auditor to solve the mystery .
 it turned out that one employee had hired someone in china to do his work for him .
 he had several other jobs at other companies that were similarly outsourced to a much cheaper chinese worker and was pocketing more than $1m per year in salary above what he paid his remote workers .
 he had always received exemplary reviews and had even turned down promotions .
 when they had instituted the physical vpn tokens ,  the remote employee had been unable to connect while his token was being sent by fedex .
  i got assigned a new job and found that the work was very labor intensive .
  so i coded it and got a 40 h/week job down to about 4 hours on monday .
  then i went looking for other things to automate in the department .
   i automated our job routing system ,  which was manual at the time ,  and i automated customer letter production ,  and i automated another managers job because they left and was going to give the work to me .
  totally eliminated that job .
  then i got promoted to it .
  and here i stay as a lowly space cadet 23rd class because a high-up boss dislikes me and i can &apos;t get a promotion .
 dude milked the job ,  not the other way around .
 an inspiration for every 9-5er .
 for a time i worked at a google data center .
 it was my first and only tech industry job .
 but as i had been a small business owner ,  i knew how important critical thinking was for efficiency and making an impact .
 so i took advantage of how we (new techs) were encouraged to think outside the box and even learn to write simple scripts to automate .
 there were obvious areas where time was wasted on epic levels .
 one such was grabbing machines to be fixed from the repair queue .
 techs would sit down for 45-120 minutes per day waiting for and picking machines that they preferred to work on .
 so i wrote a script in which i could set the parameters and run in a single moment or passively through the day to selectively grab machines the moment they hit the queue .
 instantly ,  i saved many hours per week and my workflow surged .
 i didn &apos;t run it in a way which would grab more than i could reasonably do or in a way which would have a negative impact on my co-workers .
 typically ,  i would run it to grab what i needed for the first 6 hours or so and then tweak it to grab just enough for the final push depending on how the morning went .
 it all went wrong the moment i shared that script with my manager and a few others with the intent to make it widely available to everyone .
 instead of seeing the benefit of it ,  a few other temp techs (all of us hustling for the ft hire position) and ft techs complained .
 my mind was blown as i was actively giving it to others and not keeping it as a means to only enhance my own workflow .
 it appeared that my manager saw it as a divisive thing and once a few started to complain ,  a target was lit up on my back .
 i was fired within a month .
 another time i wrote a script (with the assistance of another higher tier tech as i was just starting to learn during my breaks and lunch time) and shared it with a weekend temp tech on a friday .
 that next monday i came in to hear other ft techs speaking highly of that same temp because he wrote a sweet script .
 it was my script .
  i said so and they looked at me like i was the scum of the earth .
 this was the job in which i realized i was not cut out for office politics and i needed to just do my own thing .
 moral of the story is to keep your scripts/code to yourself .
 co-workers ,  as a whole ,  100% look out for #1 and will cut your throat to get ahead .
 some reports were part of my job ,  so after i spent 8 hours on it the first week ,  i spent another 4 hours writing macros to clean up and process the data ,  plus a couple of extra hours to customize shortcuts and from then on my reports would be done in 15 minutes .
 i &apos;d also hold off on the delivery so i could handle other things .
 had they known i was automating it i &apos;d just get more work and shorter deadlines .
 i also made sure to tell the boss that it was not the most fun ,  but i was happy to help .
 same in my current job .
 we have to copy and paste some data .
 after making some mistakes and taking too long to double-check it ,  i discovered autohotkey and do that 80% faster than i used to with zero errors .
 as the company has a different mentality ,  i shared it with everyone .
 my co-worker who refuses to learn anything new spends two hours on a two-minute task and complains to the boss about this task at every opportunity .
 i made templates of our most popular items which generally made invoicing easier .
 then i opened up new accounts with manufacturers because we were buying from resellers .
 our company has grown so much from me just asking  &apos;wait ,  why don &apos;t we just .
 i have a friend who is .
 a little slow about finding stuff on a new program on her pc .
 screenshots with the pointer in the right spot is so so so much easier than walking her through it with words .
 this is what i also do for colleagues .
 somehow ,  they still mess up sometimes which makes me wonder if i &apos;m still overestimating them ,  but i just can &apos;t figure out how to make it even more easy .
 i have seen many people who will simply pretend the work takes longer to finish because they know that if the boss finds out it can get done faster ,  they will get more work but no reward of extra pay .
 some workplaces will also make people dust or sweep floors if they finish their work early - heaven forbid you just let them take off early because ,  you know 9-5 !
 and going home early but keeping the same amount of pay ?
 definitely not going to happen .
 i had a boss that wouldn &apos;t even let met leave at 4:47 pm because i was scheduled till 5:00 .
 this was just a little office where i did not have appointments ,  customers ,  or clients .
 if you &apos;re faster than others at the same job ,  it might be appropriate to charge by the job ,  and undercut others ,  but make more money by being able to do more jobs with your time .
 the fact that none of them done it that way before is very strange
 to be fair ,  imagine you are the priest ,  and this guy just cut your knot .
 and he is holding a very sharp sword ,  and has a large army outside .
 would you dispute the legitimacy of his way of solving it ?
 wasn &apos;t that the same dude who liked a guy living in a barrel ?
 this is me but i have yet to find a job that really takes my frustration with the inefficiencies into consideration .
 one job did but never gave me the time to fix it just said they wanted it done and kept me doing busy work .
 you &apos;re a project manager .
 as one myself ,  that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
 screw lazy ,  screw strong .
 i would &apos;ve copied you without a second thought
 work smarter not harder 
 ironically ,  these things were not created for lazy people originally ,  but for people with disabilities - and also very busy restaurant owners .
 i mean ,  it’s how i’m working now so .
 i tried doing that as a kid and got a slap on the back of the head .
 it was just my dad and i .
 we both hated doing the dishes ,  so they would stock pile .
 it got to the point where he offered to pay me $20 just to do them .
 before i got around to it ,  we went down the road to my aunts .
 i ended up offering my cousin $10 if he would come over and do the dishes .
 i wasnt allowed to to do that again .
 outsourcing and child labour ?
  this kids destined to be a nike ceo one day .
 lol my brother was smart like this .
 my mom worked for cadbury ,  and we each received a large batch of candy ,  tons of chocolate .
 my brother not liking sweets ,  decided to sell them at school .
 told his teachers it was a fundraiser ,  so he made easily over $75 .
 tons of other similar things like that
 that kids going places
 he said the next day that if i was a graduate he’d hire me ,  .
 this is a strange attitude .
 i &apos;ve never known any kind of art or graphics place to care one iota about degrees .
 that’s why labeling your layers and file organization is important .
 that being said i definitely have messy photoshop files unless i’m handing them off later or it’s a template .
 why didn &apos;t you just run your belt through the bag handle loops ?
 would save a crap load of time
 my coding mentor got hired in a us government position and he mentioned being able to automate a lot of tasks in his interview .
 after the interview was over he was contacted by one of the people that were in on the interview and said basically ,   &apos;look ,  we get paid such and such a year and only work such and such hours .
 do the automation ,  but don &apos;t say you are doing the automation .
 what if they do know about it ,  and they’re just better at fake being busy than you are ?
 i automated a yearly process that took months normally into a 20 minute script ,  got a fat bonus for it too !
 it’s something a ton of people in it do ,   but bosses never think to ask their employees to set something like that up .
 he couldnt handle the fact that hed been wasting so much time for years on end lol
 basically the same exact thing happened to me when i worked for the federal government .
 down to the detail about the meeting and everything .
 i still can’t wrap my mind around it either .
 on one hand ,  i’m sorry you dealt with their bullshit .
 on the other hand ,  it feels kind of nice that i’m not the only one whose encountered this .
 after many years of trying to figure it out ,  all i’ve been able to conclude is that in the public sector ,  efficiency is punished .
 and i will never work for a public anything ever again .
  &apos;what the fuck is this ?
 i ordered a fucking cube &apos;
 what &apos;s more is that a cylinder would be easier to carve and roll straight while maintaining more of the original material .
 wait until you learn about the path light travels through .
 light takes the path of least time .
 that &apos;s not hyperbole or anything .
 light will literally follow the shortest path based entirely on the time it takes to get there .
 that &apos;s pretty much how the first web cam was created too ,  lazy computer engineers wanted to see if there was coffee in the pot .
 write once ,  run everywhere .
 java must have gotten it &apos;s name from coffee-obsessed lazy engineers .
 imagine doing it their way to find 6 fucking errors
 bro your smart but not wise .
 should have continued to talk to coworkers and browsed reddit with coffee for atleast another day ,  maybe a day and a half ,  then told your boss you were done ,  with the formula .
 you could have said  &apos;yeah i spent like 8 hours the first day and another 4 ,  today ,  realised there must be a better way ,  then spent like another 6 hours making this sick formula .
 tha way you get like 2 and a half days of just chill + all the benefits of showing your boss how capable you are with the automating things .
 ofc make it seem that this automation was a one of thing ,  so she doesnt expect you to do it again
 it’s a shame you didn’t milk it for three days
 i love this one .
 can never find it when i want to tell someone about it though .
 i don &apos;t like the one about kumar .
 that seems too risky .
 9pm seems a little late to be sending texts about being late at work ,  but i don’t work in tech so what do i know
 lol that urban legend has been going around forever .
 seems to be a different product every time you hear it .
 the bare necessities of life will come to you !
 put the spigot on a timer .
 it’s also a nice demonstration of the whole purpose of programming .
 a lot of programmers here are framing this as “cheating the system” .
 but it’s not a secret .
 if you automate half your job ,  in the short term you make the same amount of money for a much easier job .
 but when a big project comes down the line ,  your employer will be able to use you without needing to go out and hire a consultant .
 and you’re also less likely to jump ship to another job ,  so your employer will find it easier to retain you with small raises and bonuses .
 this all happens even if they are unaware that your job is half-automated ,  because they’re always going to be pushing to get more out of you .
 i guess thats another case of dont finish some jobs early depending on your circumstances
 so now vacuuming doesn &apos;t count as a chore and you &apos;ll be assigned something else ?
 is a gift from above
 xlookup is on the new office builds ,  it &apos;s made me the happiest little excel nerd .
 the original said  .
 i work for a huge company .
 a huge company .
 that said ,  as management are all about 40+ ,  anyone who can use a computer for more than word and writing a letter is deemed a ‘computer geek’ (official title) .
 usually data checking consists of having one excel spreadsheet on one screen ,  and on a second screen (which has only just become ‘a thing’) it’s a good old ctrl+f to find the linked data to check .
 vlookup has literally cut my workload down from a weeks work to ten minutes .
 i’m not telling them ,  compliance and other managers on an equal footing to me all just think i’m very particular and make a low amount of errors .
 covid lockdown has meant i’m working from home and i’m literally doing a one to two day week .
 i &apos;d recommend index + match
 ah ,  the good old assistant to the regional manager approach
 spend hours of programming and troubleshoot a program to automate something you can do yourself in 15 minutes
 i use a wheely chair while tidying the shelves .
 it &apos;s quicker than heaving myself off the floor when doing the bottom shelves and much more comfortable too .
 the bosses don &apos;t like it because apparently you heed yo be suffering to be working .
 why not have an actual keyswitch on the power supply to your lathe and just put the chuck-key on the same keyring ?
 now that i think of it ,  the quote’s been credited to him a long time and he’s never debunked it .
  has it really just not come up ?
 i work for the government ,  and the first few months were training .
 during that time i wrote a ton of scripts for ms word to automate chunks of my job .
 i easily save several hours a week with them .
 these scripts could literally save tens of millions of dollars a year considering there are 10 , 000 employees doing the same thing .
 but i have told a few supervisors about the software and nobody cared .
 i want to be promoted just to do that
 i’ve read that story at least a hundred times and it still makes me chuckle every time .
 damn ,  he alpha brained you
 how long did he take ?
 digging a hole is a crazy expensive task in civil engineering for what it is .
 i can only imagine what it must be like without an excavator ,  or knowing what &apos;s under the ground .
 what if he hit more rocks ?
 and moving a ton of earth isn &apos;t that much easier than a ton of rock .
 really all he did was replace breaking up the rock with digging a hole .
 deadhead travel ,  with no load ,  just wastes time .
 then you have to go pick something up and come back .
 why make two trips when you can make one ?
 you &apos;re a fucking lunatic ,  but i like your style
 for people asking why i don &apos;t just use the bathroom rubbish bin ,  we recycle our cardboard .
 why not have a separate bin or a large paper bag in the loo for the cardboard ?
  then you &apos;d only need to bring it down on trash day ,  which is even lazier .
 trust me ,  either she knows or she will realise soon that all the  &apos;new rolls &apos; are not new .
 you &apos;re on thin ice here .
 was it your goal to become a world champion or did it just happen on its own through hard work ?
 i think just imagine a box containing all the milk cartons .
 rather than opening the box and placing all the cartons on the shelf one at a time ,  place the whole box on the shelf then cut the box off from around the cartons
 i take your point but he was actually doing it in the least efficient way possible .
 he memorised the equation he needed to ask ,  say 327 times 8 ,  walked over to alexa ,  asked her the equation ,  walked back to the laptop ,  walked back to alexa to ask her again because he &apos;d forgotten the last 2 digits ,  walk back to the laptop ,  enter the answer ,  walk back to alexa to check it again .
 he had to keep walking backwards and forwards because he knew it was cheating so he &apos;d turned the volume down so i wouldn &apos;t hear from the next room .
 so while he thought he was being clever ,  he was actually taking more time to figure the answer out using the alexa than it would have taken to do it himself .
 plus of course there &apos;s the fact he was working on a laptop that has a calculator ,  and a cortana assistant that does the exact same as alexa ,  and he knows how to use both the calculator and cortana but still chose to cheat in the least efficient way possible .
 he &apos;s never seen my solutions apparently .
 i’m getting the same idea .
 might be good to learn  ,  as for op ,  any tips on where to get started  ?
 plus ,  as a bonus ,  they’re all nice and warm
 printer then removed 145 pages from the print toner remaining .
 saved a lot of money and ink
 everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time and occasionally shits them too
 take this guy &apos;s word .
 my wife &apos;s best friend &apos;s husband is an engineer .
 he worked for a company making industrial machines .
 he decided to go start a company of his own .
 asked a lawyer and the lawyer said it should be no problem .
 six months down the road he got served a court order to shut down because he was using ip from his previous job .
 ended up going to court and got wiped out .
 hundreds of thousands of dollars penalty ,  future salary garnishment ,  the whole works .
 even if the first lawyer says it &apos;s ok ,  get a second opinion and get it all written down .
 spend 15k on lawyers up front or lose your ass .
 math is like science .
 it all makes perfect sense .
 yet stuff like history and english comes much easier to me than math or science
 the managers had all been trained at an older location by the franchisee and his gm ,   to open the new location where i started on the first day it was open for training .
 it was maybe a month in before they handed me the job .
 i have no idea how long they did it that way at the old store .
 hard workers ,  ready to tackle anything .
 not the right guys for this lateral thinking exercise ,  lol .
 well when it comes to picking advisors i guess he’s missing a leg to stand on
 the real life hack is always in the comments comments
 that only works if the stove clock doesn &apos;t keep flashing  &apos;12:00 &apos; forever until you manually confirm the time .
 waiting for the exact minute honestly seems harder to me than just setting the time .
 you can beat the eggs in the pot first ,  just don &apos;t put it on heat before you beat them .
 properly emulsified eggs are boring .
  they are too consistent .
  every bite is identical .
 they are for sheep .
  they are for looking pretty .
  they are for perfectionists .
 stirring the eggs with a spatula in the pan guarantees the white and yolk are not perfectly mixed .
  this creates variation in appearance ,  variation in texture ,  and variation in flavour .
  variation is interesting .
  variation is for people who are sophisticated .
  tell your hubs i said so .
 pro tip for the real lazy: if don’t cook your eggs at all ,  there will be no dishes to clean taps forehead
 in this case ,  since the retiring person worked full time doing this and often struggled to meet deadlines they hired a replacement .
 this is actually my job .
 i work for a local government entering new ,  renewed existing and disposal of our ‘assets’ .
 primarily roads and stormwater ,  essentially anything that is near a road that the local government has to maintain .
 the old guy who left ,  at 72 years old ,  legit wrote everything down before punching it into excel to be converted into our financial database .
 when i started i was shown how the job worked and i asked did i have to write stuff down .
 my boss said no ,  that was just his old school way of doing it .
 so instead i immediately entered data into excel ,  skipping how long winded first process and cut the job time down significantly .
 due to this i got more duties and responsibilities .
 but it came with a raise .
 so i guess that’s a 50/50 win ?
 made yourself more efficient and use the extra time to make your colleagues less efficient ?
 ron swanson has entered the chat .
  &apos;given the choice of doing something and doing nothing ,  i will always choose doing nothing .
 unless doing something helps someone else do nothing .
 i used the productivity to destroy the productivity
 pretty sure they had an idea ,  and then worked hard for 3 days to get it operational .
 doesn &apos;t sound like a surveyor .
 i &apos;m guessing that they were shaking the trees ,  then picking up the apples that fell ?
  so with the tarp down ,  all they had to do was grab the corners and pour into a container .
 didn’t get my coffee either .
 you could’ve checked on the webcam .
  &apos;over &apos; means you &apos;re expecting a response from the other party .
  &apos;out &apos; means you &apos;re done with the conversation .
  &apos;over and out &apos; would mean you &apos;re expecting a response and you &apos;re done with the conversation .
 did i catch a niner in there were you calling from a walkie talkie .
 i get an extra incentive bonus is i go over rate ,  but i only go over rate by like .
 i can get 1800 ,  but i usually dont go for it .
 i just relax and do my parts slowly .
 i &apos;ll edit my post to say that .
 for my coworkers ,  it generally is faster .
 but i &apos;ve watched them do it and they have no rhythm to it at all .
 but if you take 2 minutes to set the table ,  you can just do it all in a row .
 tape weave weave tape .
 i &apos;ve tried explaining and showing others ,  but they says it &apos;s  &apos;too complicated &apos; and  &apos;too much work &apos; and  &apos;it will confuse me .
 it &apos;s called one piece flow manufacturing .
 in this case whenever you start or finish work on a part you have to pick it up or put it down .
 that takes time in itself .
 by doing the full process from start to finish you are actually handling each part half as much so end up saving time .
 an easy experiment you can do to demonstrate this is by making two lots of 10 paper planes and timing yourself for each lot .
 on the first lot you should do one fold on each plane one at a time .
 most people would guess that this method would be faster .
 for the second lot you should make each paper plane from start to finish before moving on to the next one .
 this method is the actual fastest way .
 that &apos;s why i haven &apos;t said a word .
 i did this ,  and who was the first one laid off in 2008 when the economy tanked ?
 the dude who didn &apos;t do anything but maintain the  &apos;completely automatic &apos; system .
 i got a call about two years later that the server i had set up crashed and they couldn &apos;t recreate the process .
 i never returned the call ,  and guess who went out of business shortly after .
 this got more attention than i was expecting ,  so some more info: this was a small construction-related company ,  so they were hit very hard by the 2008-2009 recession .
 i really had no hard feelings about being let go at the time it happened ,  mostly because i was already looking for something else ,  anyway .
  but due to the economy at the time ,  i still ended up unemployed for another six months ,  and i felt lied to by the owner about his efforts to bring me back ,  sell one division that would get me a job ,  etc .
 one could say i grew more and more bitter about it at time went on .
 still ,  they asked for some help from time to time ,  and i did go back to do some consulting at a decent hourly rate more than once .
 it was a year or so after those calls stopped that they were really in the shit .
 by that time ,  i was on to a much better job (still there 10 years later ,  now making literally triple what i made at the construction company) .
 if they could have afforded to pay what i would have demanded ,  they could have afforded to not have a problem in the first place .
 the writing was on the wall at that place for a while ,  so i may have been one of the straws that broke the camel &apos;s back ,  but hardly the first ,  and probably not the last .
 bad management all around killed that business .
 it &apos;s like bosses think that you  &apos;cheated &apos; by automating the thing ,  especially since they only see the end result and not the painstaking hours of research and prototyping that went into it .
 doubly so since you probably spent a lot of personal time just thinking and researching how it would work .
 boomers especially don &apos;t understand that coding is tricky ,  they just see the end result and go  &apos;hehe number from here move here &apos; without realizing all the many ,  many things that could go wrong .
 like ,  dumb labor would seem a lot more impressive to them ,  since it &apos;s  &apos;hard work &apos; .
 the fact that you left two manuals is very kind of you though .
 i remember i worked in a small it department in college and the head admin had everything automated .
 he &apos;d spend the whole day playing games or watching youtube but he still performed all of his duties in a timely manner .
 one day we played a full game of civ v while monitoring the progress of a script that updated everyone in the office from xp to win 7 .
 all of the work got done on time and correctly so we really weren &apos;t doing anything  &apos;wrong &apos; .
 it guy here who fucked up .
 i &apos;m not trained in it but in commercial shipping .
 when i came in the office on the first day i got the rundown and started working .
 i found so many systems that just didn &apos;t make sense and were completely inefficient .
 like a good mo-er (shipping term) i made a report and gave it to my boss ,  he said  &apos;great ideas ,  go ahead &apos; .
 i executed them and a month later the team went from 40ish to 25 cause it saved so much time .
 i hate manual ,  repetitive tasks .
 any mindless thing i have to do over and over ,  i find a way to automate .
 it frees me up to deal with more interesting problems .
  i had half an hour in the morning to just drink coffee and browse the internet until the script pushed the update live automatically at 8:30 .
 mornings are for coffee and contemplation .
 smart enough to delegate his own job ,  but not smart enough to set up a local vpn proxy to hide the blatantly obvious foreign ips ,  or to just set up a webcam to point at the token .
 it sounds like you need to change employer .
 use your more advanced experience before it goes stale .
 my first programming job was in 1974 .
 at that time ,  the job title was  &apos;systems analyst &apos; because much of the work was to take a paperwork procedure at a business ,  analyze it ,  and design an automated system to replace it .
 i figured that all the opportunities for turning manual paperwork systems into computerized systems had been accomplished decades ago .
 from what i read here ,  that &apos;s not so .
 this is the same exact thing that will keep me from working retail sales ever again .
 i enjoyed the work i got to play with gadgets and help people which i enjoy doing .
 but the internal employee to employee back stabbing .
 i don &apos;t want any part of that ever again .
 except for me it &apos;s more like  &apos;i &apos;m not wasting my time doing the same thing 4 different ways ,  and i refuse to waste your time teaching you to do it that way .
 we need more time for reddit/music/whatever ,  so let &apos;s not tell anyone ,  and just chill for half the day &apos; .
 office space is also one of my favorite fairy tales .
 i hate fiddling with print screen though so whenever  the snip tool came out in windows ,  i did a happy dance .
 i work from home and often have to help with spreadsheets or accounting software - being able to show someone an image of their entry with a big yellow circle around the amount or button in question has saved both parties a ton of frustration .
 update: thanks for all the tool recommendations !
 i’ll definitely check them out .
 i’ve written a fair number of help desk articles at my job ,  and i’ve come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter how simple ,  easy ,  or specific the instructions are .
 if people skip steps or simply don’t read the full instructions it doesn’t matter how good they are .
 i don &apos;t think this is universally true ,  but for a certain segment of people it definitely applies .
 i like to solve problems ,  my two main problems when i work is my work load and the arbitrary requirements of my time .
  i could do the amount of work i &apos;m assigned in half the time i do now ,  but my primary motivation is to simply avoid being hassled ,  the easiest way to do that is to always be ready to turn something in but never turn it in before it &apos;s due .
 i do not reap the rewards of my labor ,  so why do i want to do more labor ?
  working for others is a suckers game ,  which most of us unfortunately have no other choice but to do .
 my previous employer has a very old school office system .
 everything was done manually when i got there .
 there were boxes upon boxes ,  3 years worth of receipts and files not properly documented .
 i back logged those files ,  created a filing system and made electronic forms to consolidate both offices that we had so every time they needed something it was easy to track .
 i made an efficient system that cut my work in half .
 when it was time for my contract renewal ,  i asked for a raise because i felt like i somehow proved my worth .
 he said why would he have to raise my salary when i don &apos;t do so much anymore ?
 i can attest that i often don’t do it that way because it gives me a break to walk outside .
 no but i would roll my eyes very heavily .
 probably sigh too .
 the barrel dude was called diogenes who was a philosopher who was famous for founding the school of cynic philosophy .
 he gave up all of his possessions apart from a barrel and a small bowl which he drank from .
 he was famous for jacking of in public and ,  when alexander the great visited him and asked him what he could do for him ,  diogenes &apos; response was that he should move because he was blocking the sun .
 acknowledge that the tech experts in your project are the experts that know how the tech should be done .
 a good pjm job is keep the nonsense from the people doing the actual work and keep them up to date .
 you don &apos;t get bonus pay for having an aching back .
  back then it was muscle only .
 unfortunately ,  a lot of these products have to be marketed like time-saving devices and convenience gadgets to justify production ,  which is what leads to a lot of the weird product memes .
 like sure ,  you can make fun of a little claw tool that helps you put on your socks without bending over ,  but elderly ,  ill ,  and disabled people sure are glad that tool exists .
 i don’t know your financial situation but i feel the bar to achieve this dream is extremely low
 i was watching a cooking class online when the chef pushed a peeled hardboiled egg through a cooling rack .
 the rack was sitting on top of a bowl to collect the freshly  &apos;chopped &apos; egg bits .
 the whole process took less than one second per egg ,  and my mind was blown .
 gotta start young
 now all he needs is to undercut his employee .
 scare him straight by telling him the kid down the block will do it for cheaper and this quarter the numbers are lower than expected so take the pay decrease or leave .
 i was a pretty entrepreneurial child myself !
 i sold small shiny rocks in elementary ,  and in middle school my mom worked at a bbq place that gave her so much beef jerky we kept it in a 5 gallon bucket ,  and i &apos;d regularly sneak some to sell at school .
 i don &apos;t know why i never sold homework services (okay i do ,  it &apos;s because i never did my own damn homework -- i was capable ,  just lazy) ,  but i did take an ar test for someone once for cash .
 he probably had to go back to school after the internship ended .
 mine &apos;s always layer 0 ,  layer 1 ,  layer 2 ,  all the way to layer 100 .
 i was dumb little kid ,  i have no idea .
 i just remember seeing a cartoon where one of the characters said ,  “work smarter ,  not harder” and i was determined .
 it might have been chip ‘n dale: rescue rangers .
 my co-worker is the worst at being fake busy .
 i looked over at him the other day ,  and he was swimming .
 just don &apos;t reveal all your cards
 it &apos;s not really about laziness for most of us .
 it &apos;s about solving the problem once and for all because we generally hate repetitive tasks because that &apos;s what the computer was designed for .
 i see nothing wrong with it .
 it kinda isn’t fair to pile more work on a person just because they work more efficiently .
 i was in a job where i did probably four times the workload because i utilized software better than my counterparts .
 we all got paid the same .
 worse than that ,  they reclassed my job based on my extensive workload ,  but to be fair ,  reclassed everyone in the office with the same title to match mine ,  so they all got raises based on my workload and then when i quit ,  no one else could do the same level of work ,  so most of my work was given to an even higher level employee .
 now i advocate not telling your boss if you’ve made things quicker .
 “why is my ‘cube’ a sphere harry ?
 once delivered ,  it can be turned onto its end to prevent it from rolling away .
 add on that its faster to carve than a sphere and maintains some usability in construction
 what &apos;s even more is that you could buy a cart once and move the block without damaging it .
 the person that did the math was very intelligently .
 i like the consideration for people who don &apos;t want physics spoiled for them
 engineers and caffeine .
 almost a symbiotic relationship .
 and then the internet of things was a useful thing ,  got hacked to be a botnet ,  and now nobody &apos;s laughing .
 imagine a company having its 60000+ crm records stored in excel ,  fully duplicated ,  and half of that with errors .
 imagine doing it their way to find 5 .
 when i first started as an analyst i took over for a series of old school guys .
 the first time i did something like this i was immediately called into my supervisor &apos;s office .
 he proceeded to explain to me if i continued to do finish things immediately how my workload would increase from higher up .
 we set up a plan to turn things in just a little earlier than expected .
 but he also told me he expected me to use the extra time to improve other things around the office ,  including taking online classes and learning new skills .
 he moved on and i ,  due to improved skills ,  advanced quickly .
 best supervisor i ever had .
 learned a ton of life skills from him .
 or don &apos;t mention the automation at all ,  show up with it done at the end of day 2 ,  and your boss just thinks you &apos;re a really hard worker .
 a lot of bosses value time on the clock rather than the actual production you do anyways .
 me neither - i just saved it so i can reference it .
 award it ,  then you &apos;ll always have it saved to your profile .
 how incompetent is this dba that he fucks up often enough to warrant an automated script ?
 kumar: thanks for the help rolling back our database yesterday !
 everything’s working great now ,  we just entered a whole bunch of new data .
  sorry for the trouble .
 script: aight ,  better roll it back again
 accidentally forget to completely log out when finishing .
 having time with the partner ,  who receives a text from me saying i’m gonna be late .
 gonna have some explaining to do too
 it &apos;s one of those stories that floats around everywhere ,  but i &apos;ve never seen any real evidence that it &apos;s actually true .
 except that timer doesn &apos;t take into account the weather .
 if its already raining at 5 pm ,  i dont want the spigot to also turn on and flood the place .
 id need to setup a device which only turns on once water levels in my water tank drop enough to need refilling .
 also ,  id need to setup overflow protection and auto-shut off .
 gets exponentially more complicated as soon as i take it a step beyond where its already at .
 is a gift from above .
  index match for the win .
 no ,  it &apos;s a gift from below .
  it eludes even satan when trying to decipher someone else &apos;s vlookup macros .
 i personally prefer index match ,  each have their advantages ,  but for me ,  i &apos;d always use im if given the chance .
 probably thinks he &apos;s edgy by editing it to make him look retarded .
 xlookup fam ,  it &apos;s the best of both worlds .
 i &apos;ve been there .
 it &apos;s a great feeling when you get something to work in a click of a button
 but think of the friends that you made along the way :)
 this guy lazies .
 i’d research it ,  but i’m too lazy .
 go talk to the cfo ,  not the supervisors .
 don &apos;t say you &apos;ve already created the scripts; say you &apos;ve analyzed the workflows and identified multiple places they are costing far more than they need to ,  and offer to create faster processes for a salary bump or bonus (or higher-duties or a promotion if bonuses aren &apos;t on offer) commensurate with the proposed savings .
 include estimated savings .
 do not provide details of the specific processes - this is a good way to have the cfo assign the job to an in-house programming team and you get nothing .
 do provide approximations of the amount of time and money (especially money) it will save ,  backed up by scrubbed data .
 heck ,  if it could save tens of millions ,  offer to do it as a contractor (not an employee) for $1 .
 37m or thereabouts ,  with 10% upfront and payments based on improvements at various points during the project .
 take a leave of absence as a government employee for six months ,  roll out a selection of the scripts every two months ,  spend the rest of the time on the beach .
 many companies whose primary revenue comes from government contracts have started this way .
 i &apos;m guessing it isn &apos;t real ,  and the story is implying that digging out dirt is easier than smashing and removing a boulder of the same size .
 i was at gen con 2001 chilling with my boys and i saw they had the yugioh united states championship .
 so i was like  &apos;eh fuck it &apos; .
 won so i qualified for the 2002 world championship .
 wasn &apos;t something i planned ,  it just happened .
 oh yeah ,  i totally understand that and meant no offense whatsoever ,  if that applies .
 i promise you ,  far be it for me ,  a total stranger on the internet ,  to exert any opinion whatsoever on a parenting decision !
 i hope i didn &apos;t come off as judgy ,  i was just trying to be a little humorous and offer a silly compliment ,   but yeah ,  if it were my son he would have lost alexa privileges for a little while !
 when your answer is right but you get 0 points because your prof didn’t like how you did it
 learning macros with vba is a good start for simple automation .
 also dont underestimate the power of a vlookup or pivot table .
 more experienced people will have better suggestions than me but that &apos;s where i started getting a good grip with excel
 i love just printed paper .
 especially in the winter .
 i remember in primary school ,  our teacher would give us photocopied worksheets and i would rub them on my face .
 printers don &apos;t track toner life that way ,  but they do track things like drum and fuser life .
 and if its a machine serviced by a provider ,  you &apos;re probably paying a cost per page .
 see this is something people don &apos;t understand .
 if you think you &apos;re gonna do something that makes a lot of money ,  stop .
 work on it at home ,  quit if your contract requires it .
 if you had an idea on the job ,  discovered something on the job ,  etc ,  your company is not entitled to it .
 if you spend company time building it ,  they are .
 that &apos;s because you can sort of fudge with history and english .
 there &apos;s more than one way to see things rather than absolutes like math and some sciences .
 just call the energy company to reset the entire city &apos;s clocks at the same time .
 it would probably take me weeks to do .
 time would pass everyday and i’ll think “fuck ,  not again”
 as long as it &apos;s a metal pan ,  but then they &apos;ll stick .
  if i see my wife scraping a whisk around in my no-stick pan ,  we &apos;re going to have words .
 i guess they have teflon/plastic whisks now though ,  so that would work .
 my gf works for an insurance company and basically spent months working on spreadsheets to compile quarterly vendor claims for the last 10 years; each quarter with thousands of rows .
 i just finished my ms in analytics .
 i spent a few hours with her asking exactly what she needed to do .
 wrote 3 lines of code in sqlite and basically saved her months of work .
 now when she has to work in these projects she runs the program and that’s that .
 i was pretty proud of that .
 learn a little programming and the data entry would take maybe a minute or two
 only if your pay is more than the old guy .
 usually they leave make x they bring in someone else pay them say 1/2x and then you get a raise and more work .
 important thing is if you are happy with what you are getting though .
 “i would work all day if it meant nothing got done”  .
 more the general attitude of “fuck you ,  mountain; this is a level path now .
 railroads have this game they play ,  you see .
 you go forward a hundred feet ,  and if you are three feet higher or lower than you started ,  you lose .
 then you do it again ,  until you cross a whole continent .
 thanks for gold !
 basically how you harvest olives .
 they &apos;ve stopped letting me put those in the mcdonald &apos;s
 i feel like  &apos;over and out &apos; is some hollywood bullshit .
 fat guy in a little coat .
 the secret is shameless self-promotion .
 use secret scripts and automation but instead of telling everyone else how awesome your scripts are and how well automated everything is ,  use the output (work) from those and tell everyone how good you are at these tasks and reports and how well you &apos;ve got it handled .
 how does one start learning to automate work ?
 what programming language should i learn when i &apos;m not working so i can start making life easier ?
 also do you have any resources that you recommend that helped you learn automation ?
 should have offered to come back and help them for an exorbitant consulting fee
  &apos;why do we pay the it people ?
 there are never any it problems !
 i dont know if they felt it was  &apos;cheating &apos; ,  but i did notice more and more  &apos;easy &apos; work getting piled on me .
 just very time consuming stuff .
 they looked at it like  &apos;we will pay you more if we see results &apos; .
 i looked at it like  &apos;want results ?
 it was honestly the dirtiest  &apos;code &apos; work i have done ,  but it worked .
 im happy i left .
 i miss the coworkers ,  but not the work
 i once automated myself out of a job .
  i spent years creating scripts that cut hundreds of hours of labor for our it department .
 we went from  taking days to respond to non-critical tickets to minutes .
  new management saw that i was spending all my time  &apos;sitting around &apos; and cut our department ,  laying me off and cutting hours/pay for the other two people in my position .
 six months later when all the scripts were breaking down from software updates and environment changes ,  the network administrator took a small amount of pleasure telling management  &apos;we can &apos;t keep up because you got rid of the only guy who understood all the automation ,  so we have to just remove it when it breaks .
 it &apos;s like bosses think that you  &apos;cheated &apos; by automating the thing  .
 what was weird in my automation projects was the amount of just suspicion that i received from management .
 you had folks spending 8 hours a week on manual reports that i can automate down to a 15 minute job and management looks at me like i have 3 heads for suggesting it .
 then ,  i spend an afternoon making the entire system ,  show them how it works ,  and they still think it is some sort of scheme on my end .
 i realized the first time that i had to do those reports that they were all downloading a spreadsheet from our system ,  then printing it out on paper ,  and entering the numbers into a spreadsheet like a bunch of jackasses .
 it was a great environment and great small team ,  so i made sure they were ok when i left .
  the only reason i left is somewhere was going to pay me more than double and they could not afford to even come close to matching it .
 if you are doing your job and nothing breaks ,  they ask why they have you .
 if something breaks ,  they ask why they have you .
  its the it catch 22 .
 i automate stuff like that but i still need to be on hand for when the automation hits a snag .
 with many automated jobs this is a regular occurrence .
 i found a decent way around that problem .
  usually i will come up with some other way to occupy time that will earn money .
  a simple  &apos;hey we could be doing this thing and making bank &apos;  propose that first ,  then when they say we dont have time or resources give them the time saving proposal .
  follow it up with an  &apos;i found some inefficiencies here that could be automated to save time and money needed for that other thing .
 some employers might just take the second way anyway ,  but at least you tried .
  any employer should be looking for new income anyway .
 next time only auto mate those to make yourself look good for promotion .
  then when you get promoted to your boss &apos;s job ,  slowly implement permanent change as employees leave to take up the slack .
 next promotion for learning your department .
 meanwhile you are looking for opportunities at the next level .
 dumb enough to give unfettered access to verizon &apos;s internal network to a random underpaid guy in china .
 sounds like he needs to automate his boss .
 it doesn &apos;t stay advanced forever .
 i think these guys aren &apos;t so much computerizing paperwork as automating computational tasks .
 the principals are the same though .
 let me introduce you to the steps recorder .
 click windows icon ,   type steps recorder click on program .
  click start record .
 complete your actions click stop record .
 you have a slideshow/screenshot recording of your actions with  &apos;user left click start &apos;  &apos;user left click %this% &apos; highlighting what was clicked .
 that you can send to some one or setup as a help page .
 there are a few studies that have shown most people with 8hr shifts can accomplish the same work in \4hrs .
 depends on the job obviously but i reckon the vast majority of white collar workers are spending a sixth of their day milking the clock in various ways .
 when i was younger ,  i played in a band with a booking agent who promised to get us lots of work ,  and she did .
 we had gigs about five nights a week .
 the problem was ,  she would get the gigs by undercutting the market and having us work for basically nothing .
 it was exhausting .
 i would drive an hour sometimes ,  set up and work all night ,  then arrive home at 3am with $40 in my pocket .
 i knew friends who played these same nightclubs on weekends who were making hundreds of dollars apiece for the same work .
 the booking agent was always frustrated at the fact that we could never get those good-paying weekend gigs .
 but the problem was obvious: the club owners saw us as the  &apos;cheap band &apos; they used to have entertainment on weeknights .
 why on earth would they pay us more ?
 they took us at the value we sold ourselves at .
 that &apos;s how you get rekt in england .
 you left out the funniest part about him jacking it in public .
 when people told him to stop or ask him why he did that he responded by saying  &apos;if only i could satisfy my hunger by rubbing my stomach &apos; .
 diogenes was a sassy lil &apos; bitch .
 he also threw away his bowl when he saw a kid drinking directly from his hands .
 his most famous bit was that he would walk around with a lamp during the daytime ,  and when people asked what he was doing ,  he would say he was looking (unsuccessfully) for one honest person .
 my favorite bit is when he was asked what should be done of his body after his death .
 he told people to throw his body outside the city walls so that the wild dogs may feed on him .
 when asked if he &apos;s bothered knowing his body would be desecrated ,  he asked for a stick to fend off the dogs .
 when told he wouldn &apos;t be able to use the stick because he &apos;d be dead ,  he replied  &apos;then why do i care what happens to my body ?
 he &apos;s basically ancient era danny  &apos;just throw me in the trash &apos; devito , 
 after this exchange alexander said that were he not alexander he would like to be diogenes
 my favourite diogenes story is that time plato described humans as featherless bipeds ,  so diogenes brought a plucked chicken in and went  &apos;behold !
 imagine getting such a sick burn from a homeless guy that people remember it thousands of years later .
 yup ,  just chronic pain and a constant flow of painkillers .
 the good thing about that is that getting lazy people to buy them too helps lower the cost ,  making them more affordable for those who actually need them .
 nestle has entered the chat
 if he hadn’t been caught he could’ve eventually gotten a raise while paying his subordinate the same
 yeah i guess that makes sense .
 definitely it was scrooge mcduck talking about his shoe shining business as a kid
 i just got a mental image of someone sitting in an office ,  looking over to the other side to see their coworker splashing around in a paddling pool in the corner
 are you a turtle ?
 is swimming some fancy it slang the rest of us don’t know ?
 are you beavers ?
  &apos;brian ,  get over here ,  we &apos;ve got a fucking dam to build !
 are you a lifeguard ?
 that &apos;s a real danger about automating everything about your job .
 at one point some executive or bean counter might be like  &apos;why do we still need him ?
 the system is easy enough for anyone to use now !
 this seems like being cautious which is good advice ,  but i think it &apos;s also a bit pessimistic .
 if you &apos;re the kind of person that can create these cards .
 and you give them all up and get a bad result ,  because the company who took them all didn &apos;t give you any credit ,  you leaving is like the company taking the golden eggs and letting the goose walk free .
 i get a lot of satisfaction out of making computers do work for me .
 that &apos;s exactly the problem with salaried jobs .
 you learn to not go as fast as you can ,  because then you &apos;re working more for the same amount .
  &apos;no ,  i don &apos;t care that we &apos;re now leaping centuries ahead in advancement ,  you can &apos;t fit a sphere this size into this square prism ,  the fuck is wrong with you harry ?
  you can make a new shape but you haven &apos;t developed size constancy ?
  you know what the problem with you is ?
  you &apos;re psyching yourself out .
  you keep trying to show yourself up to impress that neanderthal girl shari and you &apos;re being too smart for your own good .
  this is useless to us harry ,  thank you for wasting everyone &apos;s time .
  hey ,  everyone ,  guess who wasted everyone &apos;s time and effort .
  &apos;it didn &apos;t vary very much ,  &apos; explains dr stafford-fraser .
  &apos;it was either an empty coffee pot ,  or a full one ,  or in more exciting moments ,  maybe a half-full coffee pot and then you &apos;d have to try and guess if it was going up or down .
 i like to think coffee needed humanity to build the internet and spaceships for it :p
  &apos;as you know ,  our students &apos; records are stored on a microsoft paint file -- which i was assured ,  was future-proof .
 that &apos;s a good boss ,  hey don &apos;t work too hard or you &apos;re gonna get fucked
 if it takes you 1 day to do something ,  tell them it will take you 3 then turn it in at the end of 2 .
 had a teacher back in high school who taught the graphics design and web programming class who beat this into the class the first week .
 it has helped me more than most things i remember from high school still
 id keep that shit to myself and just chill .
 i &apos;m contributing the same amount of production as coworkers doing it the slow manual way .
 your typical every day dba tbh .
 karma is a bitch and this came to bite my ass hard today ,  i just messed up badly and the dba save my ass  .
 maybe he &apos;s so competent he only needs help when he &apos;s absolutely sure only a rollback is needed ?
 honestly ,  i think it &apos;s super considerate .
 as a partner ,  i would love to be kept in the loop of when my s .
 is getting off work .
 if i got a message saying  &apos;working late &apos; while they &apos;re home and they just say they thought they would be so they set it up to send earlier in the day ,  i would be fine with that .
 the random reasons for why they &apos;ll be late seems odd though .
 you don &apos;t need to lie .
 its laziness all the way down ,  jim .
 but i &apos;ve never seen any real evidence that it &apos;s actually true .
 i &apos;m forced to believe this is false .
 bears usually hibernate in the winter .
 which is when it typically snows .
 although with canada who can say ?
 maybe they get snow in july .
 it sounds like something from a coen brothers film .
 look into arduino farms !
 they have very simple moisture detectors !
 rc valve ,  water level sensor ,  arduino .
 would probably take two days of work and $150 .
 hlookup is a gift from the side
 i had a combination of vlookup and count if that got very elaborate to auto-generate prices and generate automatic transmittal and invoices in the same spreadsheet .
 i looked at it like a year later and it was like trying to read mandarin .
 how the f am i only hearing about this now ?
 is it as reliable and flexible as index match ?
 just watched a 3 minute video on it and yes ,  it seems just as versatile as index match but only requires the standard 3 arguments .
 just came out like 9 months ago ,  so we’re not crazy .
 i just created a program to search it for us
 pivot table and v/h lookups are great but it’s also handy to know sumifs .
 a lot of businesses have preset spreadsheets and want the data in that exact template .
 instead of doing a pivot then vlookup ,  you can just put in a sum if .
 source: my job is actual what the original commenter describes - i work as a data analyst with a focus on automation and leaning out processes to make them more efficient
 that’s why i love math; once you get the right answer ,  you’re done ,  and it’s perfect .
 like ,  there is no more-correct answer for 2+2 ,  than 4 .
 but there is always a better opening paragraph for a paper .
 or a clearer way to convey a point etc .
 what about the clock in my car ?
 i work in insurance ,  am currently on reddit because i &apos;ve finished my work for the day .
 it &apos;s 1pm ,  i started at 11 and and done at 7pm .
 i &apos;m bored already .
 learning sql overrode the fact that i didn &apos;t finish my degree .
 no one cares anymore about  &apos;where i came from &apos; because i can get what i need without waiting for the data team .
 assuming they don &apos;t use some fucked up propriety interface like my company does .
 hacked together in some basement 20 years ago by the lowest bidder
 yup ,  but i love watching that machine go at those trees .
  &apos;repeat &apos; is an artillery command ,  to fire another salvo at the same coordinates .
 no one in the military says  &apos;repeat &apos; over the radio .
 the correct lingo is  &apos;say again .
 phonetic alphabet is handy af ,  though ,  everyone should learn it .
 the funny part is that the boss thinks were dumb enough to spend hours on manually executing stupid meaningless tasks every day instead of automating them .
 then he praises us for the amount of time it must have taken us to do said tasks .
 always promise to do the work in ten hours and finish it in five .
 when shit hits the fan ,  you &apos;ll have extra time to iron out the wrinkles and look like a miracle worker without working yourself to death .
 remember the star trek tng episode where scotty talks to laforge .
 never tell your boss how long it &apos;ll actually take !
 if your company uses ms office ,  macros are made in visual basic .
 it &apos;s an awful language and i don &apos;t recommend learning it unless you are making office macros .
 otherwise ,  python or javascript .
 like twice your yearly salary kind of fee .
 while it is cathartic to watch them burn ,  it &apos;s way more worth it to charge them some ridiculous amount as a consultant .
 and then do just enough work to keep them profitable enough to pay you .
 you is da real mvp by documenting your systems .
 the flip side is that most people are so technologically illiterate/lazy that performing the most basic of it functions in front of them makes you look like an ingenious wizard .
 which is exactly what we were doing .
 there was a monitor that we had the program display updates on to make sure things were going smoothly and obviously could stop the game at any time since it &apos;s turn based .
 thankfully everything went smoothly so we didn &apos;t have to intervene too much .
 all things considered ,  halving your employment is new income basically .
 i get your point though ,  if you can keep them and make more money then that should be preferred .
 but cutting staff is way easier generally and you can see the immediate results .
 my first day in a sales role my boss told me to quote a more expensive option than what the client needs on every job and if they are stupid enough to pay it then take the money ,  if they complain about the price act like their best friend and tell them ok look i can try and bring the price down but please do not tell my boss .
 then charge them what we should have charged them at the beginning (which was over inflated already) and look like a hero .
 i hated it so much and people would sometimes be so happy how much i had  &apos;lowered &apos; the price they would send a card or a bottle of whisky to say thanks .
 the worst hangovers  are the ones you don &apos;t deserve .
 that sounds like a verizon problem ,  not an employee problem ,  especially considering his $1m salary .
 dumb enough to give unfettered access to verizon &apos;s internal network to a random underpaid guy in china .
 i doubt the guy in china was underpaid ,  since the chinese coder was probably also collecting a paycheck from huawei r&d ,  as well as the china ministry of state security .
 or sitting in bullshit meetings or suffering other corporate bullshit that has nothing to do with the individual completing their work .
 i still love the classic diogenes story of mocking plato in his own school after plato described the most base form of man as  &apos;a featherless biped &apos; by running in with a plucked chicken and shouting  &apos;behold ,  a man !
 his death is also amazing: .
  &apos;his cause of death has been given as either severe food poisoning from eating a raw ox &apos;s foot ,  rabies from a dog bite ,  or suicide by holding his breath .
  &apos;why you doing that ?
 i &apos;m fucking horny !
 why else would someone do this ?
 he &apos;d also stand outside brothels and shout ,   &apos;a beautiful whore is like poisoned honey !
  &apos; people would give him money to shut up .
 when he had enough money he &apos;d go inside the brothel .
 i think he was specifically walking around the local market .
 so he was accusing the vendors and market goers of being dishonest .
 and of course ,  diogenes replies that if he were not diogenes ,  then he too should like to be diogenes .
 i use my weird tools both when i find it hard to move and also when i am too lazy to :p
 you can also pluck them like awful little musical instruments .
 china has joined the chat
 i get a trimmed down version of this at my current job .
  it &apos;s a pharma production company ,  pays about $75k a year ,  good medical and retirement plans ,  and 5 weeks pto per year .
 my two main responsibilities are planned mechanical upgrades/maintenance ,  and fixing any breakdowns that happen during production runs .
 so if i &apos;m doing my job right and the machines are running smoothly ,  i basically only have to do about 15 hours of work a week ,  and be on call for the rest .
 which is fine by me ,  because my house is 3 minutes away from work- i can usually get there faster than some of my colleagues can from the building across the street .
 sure ,  there are some weeks where i put in 50 ,  60 hours a week or more to make sure we make a deadline .
  but those are rare ,  maybe once every couple months .
  it &apos;s honestly the best job i &apos;ve ever had .
 i could probably get a bit of a pay bump if i found another company ,  but i &apos;m more than happy with this setup .
 i imagined they filled up their cubicle .
 i doubt he &apos;s turtle enough for the turtle club .
 it’s common on the service industry too ,  basically means you’re trying not to drown from the workload
 that &apos;s why you don &apos;t tell them how .
 when you leave and suddenly it takes months again .
 they will learn a very important lesson .
 i had the same problem as a delivery guy for a large company .
 i worked my ass off to prove i could do the job well/efficiently ,  and it just resulted in more and more work .
 fast-forward a year and i &apos;m doing 4-times more work than the guy next to me for the exact same pay-check .
 maybe that dude should get paid 4-times less than me instead ,  or maybe even pay me 4-times more ,  oh wait that &apos;ll never happen ,  ever .
 i don &apos;t work with other people anymore .
  guess if it was going up or down .
 this sounds like another fun algorithm challenge
 a company i used to work for got a major new client (a mining company) and part of the contract was we &apos;d take their employee data (names ,  telephone numbers ,  email addresses) in what ever format they gave us and put it in to a csv file to upload in excel .
 we had a tonne of customers we did this for already and most either sent us messy excel files that could be fixed with a couple of formulas or they made the effort to try and format the data to what our system needed .
 not this customer .
 they sent us everything via png file .
 it took us days to get it in to the system and the client said they didn &apos;t have it in any other format .
 every week they &apos;d send us a new staff dump to update the system and every week it was a png file .
 he was even better about getting everyone working for him to improve .
 he was a body builder as a hobby and he would even take some employees to the gym and encourage them and show them how to work out .
 not many like him around .
 kumar:  &apos;sorry for all the trouble i &apos;ve been causing .
 help yourself to some krispy kreme i left in the kitchen .
 i am surprised that he doesn &apos;t have access to do that .
  every company is different of course ,  but my job as a dba would involve writing that script for something a developer messed up ,  rather than needing it from someone else .
 the random reason wasn &apos;t to lie ,  it was just so he didn &apos;t have to input anything in but it wasn &apos;t identical all the time .
  it probably doesn &apos;t really matter to the so why he was working late even though i &apos;m sure they wouldn &apos;t mind hearing about it ,  just that he was going to be late .
 idk ,  we had snow in may ,  it &apos;s possible .
 you never know wtf mother nature is giving us from one day to the next .
 hell even the forecast from environment canada is either 100% or 0% correct ,  there is no in between
 what he really needs is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators .
 something i &apos;m going to add to the list of upgrades !
 thanks for the great info !
 i have a co-worker that uses indirect a lot and his formulas scare me .
 i forget the exact count but he also discovered the maximum about of if statements you can nest in a single formula
 shoulda bought your car at midnight .
 draw ,  study ,  do something you might value as productive in an interest of yours .
 don &apos;t squander the time you &apos;ll regret it later .
 if u can that is
 analyst for a bank here .
 the person i replaced took anywhere from 24-32 hours to complete a monthly report .
 when i took over i just put a sumifs equation in excel and i &apos;m done within 3 hours .
 i &apos;ve slowly been increasing the amount of time it takes me to complete the report so now my boss thinks it takes 40 hours .
 my report was completed monday morning and here i am on reddit with nothing to do
 olive tree goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
 who wants a paycheck ?
 do you want a paycheck ?
 quadruple ,  that way you can hold out until next time :þ .
 nah ,  that &apos;s  &apos;add some zeroes &apos; territory .
 owner can kick his yearly take-home to you or never have another yearly .
 get some equity while you &apos;re at it .
 when i left my job i tossed all my work files in trash .
 my replacement called me at my new job to ask where they were .
 i told the truth .
 if someone gives you two weeks notice don’t tell them they can leave now .
 doesn’t go over well .
 then again ,  they don &apos;t share your excitement when you do something actual wizardrous because they lost you after 30 seconds
 oc said he was doing this at multiple companies ,  so he was pocketing more than $1m total from all his jobs .
 still ,  i’m sure verizon paid him well .
 this guy corporate espionages .
 diogenes sounds like the type of guy you want to have a beer with .
 no lie ,  i used to pluck ours when i was a kid and it was one of the things that taught me that musical instruments can be found in all sorts of places where they were never intended .
 even though it was out of tune (because ,  y’know ,  it was an egg slicer) ,  i still distinctly remember the eight-note tune it played .
 \ i could probably get a bit of a pay bump if i found another company ,  but i &apos;m more than happy with this setup .
 this is one of those  &apos;quality-of-life &apos; job perks that money simply cannot replace .
  i &apos;ve got a similar setup and pay rate as you ,  and i would have to be offered a significant amount to give it up .
 turtle turtle turtle 
 what if i told you ,  a very large aerospace and defense company has most of their recipes stored in pdf ?
  then what if i told you these pdf &apos;s are stored in fractured separate sharepoints depending on what building/lab you &apos;re working in .
 then if i told you how many man hours they chalk up to literally just finding the correct recipes for various products .
 i really hate my job .
 please send help ,  everyone thinks this is normal .
 sadly ,  most people don &apos;t get the luxury of having a boss that understanding and down to earth .
 he sounds like a dream boss
 sounds like all he needed to have it say is  &apos;working late .
 kumar fucked up again .
 they actually have a symbol with a light cloud ,  a dark cloud ,  a sun ,  a raindrop ,  a snowflake ,  a thunderbolt and a freezing rain line .
 it may as well just say  &apos;yes .
  &apos; at that point .
 or just install a toilet fill valve ,  they &apos;re literally designed to turn water on when a tank is low and turn it off when the tank is filled .
  would probably take twenty minutes of work and $15; and won &apos;t require constant power like an arduino .
 yeh ,  i was working on a hostel reception and on the quiet times was studying spanish just for fun .
 now i can watch whole series in the original language ,  pretty happy with that :)
 oh that &apos;s just the fee ,  it doesn &apos;t get into the hourly billing ;)
 alexander the great once told him ,   &apos;if i were not me ,  i would much prefer to be you .
 to which diogenes responded ,   &apos;i would prefer to be me ,  too .
 what if i told you ,  a very large aerospace and defense company has most of their recipes stored in pdf ?
 then what if i told you these pdf &apos;s are stored in fractured separate sharepoints depending on what building/lab you &apos;re working in .
 then if i told you how many man hours they chalk up to literally just finding the correct recipes for various products .
 i would say you could work for any of a dozen different companies just that i know of ,  and that this is far more common than you think .
 does common=normal ,  though ?
 keep fighting the good fight !
 bet that &apos;s in the random reasons .
  bet that this guy bitched at length about kumar at home at least once .
 have you seen money heist on netflix ?
 just binged the first season ,  it &apos;s great .
 subtitles are annoying tho .
 i &apos;m used to reading them but with english stuff i can look away as well .
 with spanish ,  i miss one sentence and i &apos;m confused for two scenes .
 there &apos;s something better: that ,  and finding that it was not your fault .
 bonus points if the culprit is someone you despise .
 i thought it was  &apos;if i were not me ,  i would also prefer to be me &apos; or something to that effect .
 though it is translation either way ,  so .
 i &apos;m trying to guess what &apos;s the original show .
 is it la casa de papel ?
 it rarely happens ,  but resolving a bug that has eluded everyone for multiple weeks ,  ideally within an hour or so of me starting looking into it: that &apos;s the dragon i &apos;m chasing .
  &apos;if i were not diogenes ,  i would also wish to be diogenes .
  &apos; is usually the quote .
 and crop circles are just teenager aliens doing graffitti .
 that’s the premise of hitchhikers guide to the galaxy except for the waiting for us to figure it out part
 i mean we could always just be cosmic ants .
 how often do you go out to your garden and try to communicate with the bugs ?
 the prime directive ?
 what if aliens showed up here millions of years ago ,  saw a planet inhabited buy enormous lizard monsters and said fuck that ,  dont come back to this place .
 they probably treat us like animals on national geographic .
 what if the people that were abducted by aliens were actually abducted by some alien tv host equivalent of the crocodile hunter ,  where he abducts a human and shows it off ?
  &apos;crikey what a interesting little fella this is ?
 that &apos;s actually one of many theories about seti and alien life .
 that they &apos;re so far ahead of us on the kardashev scale that for them to try to communicate with us would be like us trying to communicate with ants .
 those aliens probably watch us on tv while laughing at us: how can someone or something be that stupid .
 i believe south park tackled this thought in the episode  &apos;canceled &apos;
 this is a very common and well known theory .
  its also called  &apos;the prime directive &apos; in the star trek universe .
 alien fanatics would be showing up once a week to tell us about space jesus .
 maybe there’s an intergalactic agreement not to contact any life forms until they develop interstellar travel .
 what if we &apos;re actually a part of a very huge being ,  and to that huge being ,  it &apos;s like when we look at our own cells through a microscope .
  and that &apos;s just one being .
  there could be millions of huge beings .
 we are probably more like the sentinelese from the north sentinel island ,  part of the andaman island archipelago in indian ocean .
 they are widely considered as one of the most aggressive uncontacted tribe ,  very much hostile towards outsiders (though some would disagree) .
 the indian government declared the remote island officially off limits .
 what if those aliens are looking at this post and giggling like  &apos;they &apos;ll never know how right they are !
 we irradiated our own planet on purpose .
  we &apos;re fucking nuts ,  man .
 everyone assumes that there are these superior entities that can conduct out of this world actions .
 but if you see the evolution of life on this earth ,  over 3 billion years of trial and error until a species with the capacity to be self aware about the universe starts to rise to dominance in the last 200 , 000 years .
 only 10 , 000 since we’ve been having the amount of exponential progress we see today .
 for all we know ,  life out there could just be reptile-like creatures with no need to be highly intelligent to survive .
 perhaps we’re the beginning of the alien species .
 if we ever colonize the universe ,  humans will evolve differently from one another in a series of rapid ,  radiative ways .
 perhaps we’re the ancestors of all intelligent life in our local galaxy
 if that &apos;s true we probably killed some of them at one point .
 most uncontacted tribes have also killed some of the past people who tried to contact them .
 theyre gonna be waiting a long time
 that’s already a theory .
 because i’m getting messages and comments about this ,  i wasn’t trying to belittle the guy or say this in a manner that implies i didn’t want him to post this here .
 i just thought that maybe he didn’t know this concept already existed as i’ve done this with other ideas and would like to know .
 if there was an advanced society (or many) and they had a  &apos;hands off &apos; policy with earth ,  likely the only way they &apos;d actually be able to enforce it would be if their governing bodies had total control over their spaceflight operations .
 which is conceivable ,  to a point ,  but as soon as you introduce the possibility of private ownership of spacecraft (manned or otherwise) and operations ,  it truly only takes that one dude looking for space reddit karma to fuck it all up .
 i like to think there’s the alien equivalent of david attenborough who does the same thing to us as we do to other animals
 whelp ,  you have it at least half figured out .
 truth is ,  we have been receiving all of those old video transmission ,  i am told they are called  &apos;movies &apos; wherein your people tend to dissect and kill all aliens that land on your planet .
 they start seeing you greet visitors with respect ,  maybe something interesting will happen .
 what if we are first ?
 what if we’re more like an ant hill in the middle of the amazon ?
 or even worse ,  like a bacterium on earth .
 there are 5x1030 bacteria .
 most of those tribes remain uncontacted mostly because of concerns regarding introducing new diseases to them and because of the lack of the means for proper communication .
 i doubt these kind of issues would exist when it would come to aliens .
 the culture series covers this .
 then we probably will be contacted first by the extremist aliens who will give us the hard sell that their belief system is the best and that all we believe is a lie .
 and we will do something violent in response .
 eventually we all end up enslaved or die of an illness our immune systems cannot handle .
 banks referred to this as the  &apos;outside context problem .
 you &apos;re an island civilization that &apos;s lived on that island alone for thousands of years ,  and your tiny achievements seem like monumental history .
 you &apos;ve sent out canoes a few days &apos; sailing to see if there are other islands ,  but they found nothing ,  so the priesthood concluded the island is the world and your 15 , 000 people are humankind .
 then a boat 10 times taller than your tallest building crests the horizon ,  people in shiny metal armor hop on to your shores ,  and suddenly everything means nothing .
 i feel like they would tho ,  as we have tried so many attempts to reach out to them .
 you really think the entire galaxy could all unanimously agree to something ?
 space is practically infinite ,  light is a hard limit ,  and even if you find ways to get out there at a comfortable speed ,  spacefaring cultures will spark ,  bloom ,  ebb ,  and die in the time you travel an infinitesimally small fraction of the distance from us (or our sci-fi lightspeed limit avoiding exit) to them and we &apos;ll/they &apos;ll never cross paths .
 individual ants placed at random points in the sahara .
 what are the odds they will meet before they die ?
 this might possibly be the most preferable version of the fermi paradox
 read the three body problem trilogy ,  then be glad they haven &apos;t contacted us yet .
 tldr: anyone out there capable of understanding that we &apos;re here ought to be smart enough to know that we &apos;re also potentially dangerous to them ,  so they &apos;re better off killing us rather than contacting us .
 and ,  vice versa ,  except no we &apos;re humans so let &apos;s just tell everyone hey guys here we are .
 there is the former leader of israel’s space program who said that .
 he also said that the us and israel have a base with aliens on mars and they said we are not aloud to know yet .
 i think we &apos;re more like the folk out on the sentinel islands .
  they know we &apos;re here ,  but every time someone tries to talk to us we take potshots at them .
  so the whole planet is officially off limits .
 one of the greatest flukes in evolution is when one cell ate another cell but didnt digest it .
 this allowed the one inside to focus entirely on creating energy allowing the main cell to focus on other things .
 this gave life the ability to to form multi cellular organisms inevitabily creating complex fauna .
 so it &apos;s also a belief that even if there are countless planets teaming with life right here in our own galaxy ,  none of them have  &apos;advanced &apos; to complex organisms .
 they’d be smart not to contact us .
 we ruin everything we touch .
 guess i need to clarify the two statements i made are opinion .
 unlikely since the galactic us-equivalent hasn &apos;t tried to invade us and give us  &apos;democracy &apos; yet .
 well yeah this was already discovered don’t you remember ?
 we were banned from the federation of planets because we tried to kill babyfarts mcgeezac and hid all of the stolen space cash from the space cops ,  so now we’re barred from any future alien contact
 look at those idiots in the milky way .
 ”(eats child and shoots galactic space monsters with penis while making a drywall sandwich)
 i really love the idea of irresponsible teenager aliens .
 maybe ,  we are the irresponsible teenage aliens ,  and when we die ,  you’ll look down and see some weird bong-like device between your knees ,  then look up ,  surrounded by your alien homies ,  they’re all smiling at you and one asks “how was the trip bro ,  did you conquer civilizations and shit” then you tell them “nah i just worked a 9-5 ,  got married and had kids”  .
 then they all laugh and think you’re a loser
 and stone henge was by the alien version of banksy
 mom is going to be so mad when she finds out they snuck out again !
 that &apos;s kind of the premise of under the dome .
 just an alien child playing .
 that &apos;s the premise of star trek as well .
 and quite a few other sci to shows .
 it &apos;s also one of the possible answers to fermi &apos;s paradox .
 the zoo hypothesis .
 i like that a lot more than the great filter .
 so this premise is not only popular in sci-fi it &apos;s also a scientific possibility .
 the vogons said that they had to go to the bottom of some basement in an office building on alpha centurai .
 our closest star .
 just like how arthur had to go into a local office building in the basement to find the notice that they were building a highway through his house .
 don &apos;t mean to sound like an asshole i just really like the comparison douglas made with the people destroying arthurs house and the vogons destroying earth
 once a week for 12 years .
 don &apos;t question me !
 while i understand this question poses that we are uninteresting to an alien species but i always bring up one point .
 we have tried plenty to communicate with bugs .
 bugs don &apos;t communicate back ,  or if they do it is hostile or they flee .
 i wonder if aliens were given that reaction from us and decided to give us some more time in the cosmic oven .
 what if they &apos;re just sitting in their metaphorical home fucking around and doing nothing with their superintelligence ?
 also there would surely be some entomologists i would think .
 maybe they wouldn &apos;t make themselves so obvious
 we just need to create warp drive
 we should have been contacted by now since that directive was broken in nearly every episode
 i mean this was literally the reason for the prime directive .
 the galactic federation shouldn &apos;t announce themselves to us for another maybe 200 years from now .
 we &apos;ve got to resolve our own problems and make progress towards getting out to the greater galactic stage .
 otherwise we are just cave men wreaking havoc and getting ourselves annihilated .
 they &apos;d have been like ,   &apos;oh this isn &apos;t done ,  leave it on high for a while longer &apos;
 what if the fermi paradox exists because we are the first intelligent life in the universe .
 yes ,  that is so incredibly improbable ,  but what if we take it another step further .
 what if there is something that can force a big rip via advanced technology ,  and we constantly live in a cyclic universe .
 everytime an intelligent species reaches a certain level of technology ,  they accidentally reset the universe .
 that’s what beerus from dragon ball super said verbatim lol
 let &apos;s hit it with a meteor
 there’s a story with kinda that premise ,  though that’s only revealed a long time later ,  called deathworlders .
 highly recommend ,  pretty good sci-fi web serial .
 could you imagine if we were actually set up as a zoo and they came back to discover we figured out nukes ?
 that wikipedia page covers about 15% of the posts on this sub .
 it drives me crazy when the top 20 comments don’t even address the fact that these particular shower thoughts have already been written about extensively .
 attention unidentified space craft ,  you are approaching the planet terra .
 terra has been designated a primitive wildlife zone ,  and has been designated off limits to interstellar travelers by the galactic council .
 cut engines and prepare to be boarded ,  failure to comply with this demand will result in hostile action .
 there is a great line in the movie contact (based on the book by carl sagan) where ellie debates against the notion that aliens are always hostile .
 she says  &apos;we pose no threat to them .
 it would be like us going out of our way to destroy a few microbes in an anthill in africa .
  &apos; and then someone else replies ,   &apos;interesting analogy .
 how guilty would we feel if we went and destroyed a few microbes in an anthill in africa ?
 i’ve always had this weird thought that we’re used as a school assignment for aliens .
 like they get assigned a human and have to write an essay about why their human is they way it is and what makes it different from other humans .
 iain banks wrote a book about this in his culture series .
 aliens found us ,  but stayed away because we are like the perfect example of mutually assured destruction in action ,  and they just wanted to see how it worked out .
 one of my favorite moments is when a sentient ship with enough electronic warfare capabilities to pretty much take over the electronics of the entire world sends in a postcard to a radio program requesting a song .
 and it never gets played .
 people say that ,  but the more humans advance the more empathy we show to animals .
  there is no reason to believe aliens won &apos;t value lesser life .
 you &apos;re telling me they watch us mate on tv like i watched the elephants mate when i was seven
 they love the florida man issues
  &apos;oim gonna try a biggah anal probe .
 ooh ,  he &apos;s angry !
 look at this fella .
 30 earth quadrant years old ,  and still hasn’t found a mate .
 this little buggy simulates reproduction up to 6 times a day !
  almost always without a mate !
 “i’m going to jam my thumb in his butthole .
 that will really piss him off” .
 that some slaughterhouse five zoo kind of stuff
 you say  &apos;like some kind of crocodile hunter &apos; but there was a time in human history when europeans were bringing remote tribes people back to europe and literally putting them in human zoos for the public to ogle
 i like the evolutionary trajectory theory version of this .
 the comparison doesnt even need to be as jarring as humans and ants ,  it can be as simple as humans and apes .
 that 2% difference is what makes the difference between our two species ,  now imagine another 2% in the same trajectory away from us (humans) .
 my favorite twist on this theory is that when you consider how old the universe is vs how old it’s going to be ,  we’re pretty early along and might be the first of our kind .
 had to google kardashev scale .
 was disappointed to see google not automatically predict because i was instead bombarded by kardashian predictions .
  hence why we are stuck on earth
 the argument against that theory is that even if we aren &apos;t worth such an alien civilization &apos;s time ,  we would still be able to spot anything above a type iii ,  because they &apos;d leave unmistakable signs of their presence .
 even type iis have a good chance of being spotted based on something like emitted em signals .
 but we have scientists that do try to communicate with ants and other insects .
 we have scientists that try to  &apos;hack &apos; a virus responsible for a respiratory infection for a monkey to deliver mrna for a bit of a different virus as a way to make a vaccine .
 not quite the amoeba ,  but c &apos;mon ,  pretty close .
 the analogy doesn &apos;t really hold because we actually try these things .
 so i guess earth will be both florida and alabama of the galaxy .
 sweet home earth and crazy home earth
  &apos;their primitive data based social media network has dissolved in chaos as they furiously debate which two primary colors appear on a female &apos;s garment .
 do they also suck on each other’s jagons ?
 why does ross ,  the largest friend ,  not simply eat the other five ?
 a couple aliens studied us for a while ,  then one says to the other  &apos;well they must be intelligent because they have nuclear weapons .
  &apos; the other one says  &apos;no ,  they have  &apos;em pointed at each other .
 and john edwards being the biggest douche in the universe
 i was frustrated at the thought of having to find that episode name myself .
 dang cretins here not crediting the relevant sp !
 we &apos;re actually closed off from the universe because of randy
 also mass effect followed similar logic .
 the council would not implement other planets until they become a higher function (not still fighting each other etc) .
 once they have the means to find their interstellar transportation methods then they can join the citadel .
 it made me change my life purpose to hopefully one day seeing humanity unify enough that if this is a thing then we can be a part of it !
 which they violate just about any time they want for any multitude of reasons .
 i &apos;m not currently a believer ,  but if an alien came down telling me about jesus ,  it would at least make me stop and think lol
 goddamn jehovah &apos;s witnesses from space
 ive always thought of this odea and how atoms and solar systems etc kinda behave similarly .
 obviously they are not the same but the whole mostly empty space with a nucleus with stuff orbiting the nucleus etc is eerily similar .
 they are playing clash of clans using countries .
 kinda reminds me of the novel the omniscient reader’s viewpoint .
 and slowly and surely ,  they drew their plans against us
 yeah the first time they were contacted some of their tribes people were kidnapped .
 not surprised they are so hostile tbh
 remember that jerkoff missionary who got killed ?
 i hope ,  if he met god ,  that he got the pimpslap he so justly deserved .
 what if those aliens are looking at this post and giggling like  &apos;they &apos;ll never know we walk among them already &apos;
 the krogan would like your location
 _”hi ,  we’re the manhattan project and this is jackass .
 for all we know ,  life out there could just be reptile-like creatures with no need to be highly intelligent to survive .
 this is basically what i think .
 there &apos;s no particular _reason_ why sapience and intelligence would evolve on any given life-bearing planet ,  it &apos;s just that it happened by chance once on earth that one species had a viable path forward for intelligence to be its primary survival trait .
 it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a guaranteed end result of the evolutionary process .
 there could even be lots of sapient life out there ,  but they all just aren &apos;t interested in developing advanced technology ,  or can &apos;t conceive of doing so ,  or something .
 we see this on earth ,  animals like chimpanzees ,  elephants ,  or dolphins probably aren &apos;t _that_ much less intelligent or self-aware than us ,  but they don &apos;t have anything higher than the most basic level of technology ,  probably just because their brains aren &apos;t wired to do it .
 chimpanzees especially ,  it &apos;s been observed that they don &apos;t have the capacity to actively teach other chimpanzees or pass on inter-generational knowledge the way that humans do .
 they &apos;re  &apos;smarter &apos; than us when it comes to their ridiculously good short-term memory ,  though ,  so from the perspective of an alien who had equally good short-term memory ,  they might conclude that chimpanzees are more intelligent than humans .
 so the problem with finding  &apos;intelligent life &apos; might have more to do with the fact that our search is very human-centric and is only looking for human-like technology ,  rather than  &apos;intelligent life &apos; itself .
 in this case ufos are likely future us traveling back in time or sending messages back to us .
 over 3 billion years of trial and error until a species with the capacity to be self aware about the universe starts to rise to dominance in the last 200 , 000 years .
 if a modern fossil fuel burning civilization existed at any time before 5 million years ago and nuked themselves ,  we wouldn &apos;t know about it .
 there are gaps in the fossil record that are measured in millions of years .
 true ,  but it much more often goes in the other direction .
 maybe they experience time at a different rate than we do
 i think the more common version of this theory assumes they dont contact us because making contact makes themselves visible and other planets are smart enough to assume there are always bigger fish in the sea .
 i thought that moment in the expanse was on point .
 there &apos;s a giant space portal ,  and while the top scientists are debating what it is ,  some a-hole shoots a facebook live of himself just yoloing into it to impress his girlfriend .
 it &apos;s a very human thing to do .
 a truly advanced society would have outlawed reddit and everything resembling it ,  to reach said advanced state .
 isn’t there a new theory that we’re one of the last ,  and that the peak for alien civilizations was 8 billion years ago closer to the galactic center ?
 i hope that isn’t true- that would mean the aliens killed themselves off ,  and i don’t want humanity to just die off like that .
 that’s 8 billion years from the big bang ,  not 8 billion years ago .
 considering there &apos;s an estimated 3x1023 stars in our observable universe (who knows what &apos;s beyond that) ,  and the average planet to star ratio is generally accepted to be 1 .
 which only accounts for planets orbiting stars .
 planets are more like bacterium on earth ,  and all of us live on just one of  &apos;em .
 how would you properly communicate with aliens ?
 it could be similar for aliens .
 if they were to come here ,  maybe we would be exposed to something we can’t handle .
 or they just don’t want any of our viruses or diseases .
 what if they introduced a disease to us and killed us all off ?
 yep ,  came here to mention the state of the art .
 if anyone &apos;s interested ,  it &apos;s a book by iain m .
 banks in which a scout spaceship of an incredibly advanced civilization called the culture comes to 80 &apos;s earth to take a look at our species and decide if we should be helped and guided in our development .
 banks was a fantastic writer and culture is my favorite sci-fi ever ,  so i heartily recommend checking out the series to anyone interested in good space opera science fiction .
 every book in the series is a standalone story and they can be experienced in any order .
 that being said ,  i don &apos;t think the state of the art is the best place to start reading these books .
 i personally would recommend starting with player of games or matter .
 this is why i’ve been telling my congressman that we should be kidnapping kids ,  training them ,  injecting them with a shit ton of roids ,  and sticking them in power armor .
 it’s the only hope we have to fight terrorism ,  and they’ll come in handy when the aliens show up .
 this ,  if we ever get contacted this is how it &apos;ll happen .
 and it probably won &apos;t end in our favor .
 yes ,  but then you’re projecting human limits on cooperation and agreement onto aliens .
 the only issue i can foresee is that we expand infinitely .
 when the conditions were right we went from a population of 1 .
 6 billion to 6 billion in the span of 100 years .
 if we were to go multi-planetary ,  we could easily go from billions to hundreds of billions over just a couple generations .
 i don &apos;t  know how much that matters though ,  there are hundreds of billions of planets and the vast majority are uninhabited .
 i can &apos;t imagine there &apos;s a competition for resources amongst intergalactic travelers .
 and if aliens can figure out ftl ,  i bet they can figure out automation with technology .
 so i don &apos;t see us as being enslaved ,  nor do i imagine we &apos;d be pillaged for our resources .
 what &apos;s the motive for aliens to kill us off ?
 every couple of years some “former high ranking government official” comes out and says this ,  usually when they’re in their 80’s .
 the story flashes up and then quietly goes away .
  just enough to be relegated to a crackpot theory to keep people from thinking very critically about the idea .
 sow enough doubt in people by throwing around crackpot theories and they’re less likely to believe the real thing .
 so theoretically we could of killed a stupid ass alien who was told by everyone to not come spread their religion here but did it anyway lmao .
 speaking of mitochondria right ?
 ive always been kind of intrigued by them .
 i mean a completely different thing lives inside the cells of things to be the power plant for said thing .
 strange af occurrence in nature to be sure .
 then one alien civilization would reach out to a rival alien civilization and convince them to reach out to us .
  &apos;you beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store ?
 i can &apos;t believe i had to scroll this far down to find a hitchiker &apos;s guide reference .
 it’s about 2000 years after a guy was nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to nice to people for a change ,  and here we are thinking digital watches are a pretty neat idea .
 personally ,  i &apos;d blame the golgafrinchans .
 and the 31st is even on a thursday .
  &apos;i never could get the hang of thursdays &apos;
 ugh ,  i’ll get my towel just in case .
  &apos;your planet is slated for demolition .
 apathetic bloody planet ,  i &apos;ve got no sympathy at all .
 it &apos;s actually a pretty bad solution to the firmy paradox for a number of reasons .
 the first - any civilization that has past us is starting to edge towards k2 civilization is going to be doing a few things: .
 massive transmitters - we could dub these ssps (solar system positioning satellites) which are going to be transmitting a rather obvious patterned stepping code and we are going to get the signal over and over again .
 solar arrays - what would end up happening over time as they are built up ,  is the star would darken and the relative amount of infrared radiation for the estimated mass in the solar system would go up which would suggest artificial constructions .
 as much as klingon and etc cloaking devices are cool - hiding in space is hard .
 like astronomically hard .
 like if you are close enough that seeing the other ship out a window is possible - the infrared radiation would be extremely obvious .
 any civilization that has started expanding past their single star system is also going to have a few key noticeable features: .
 periodic bursts of energy caused by ships accelerating to interstellar speeds or some other massive energy source that will be detectable for light years around it .
 transmitters to send data at ftl speeds to ships enroute as well as to colonies etc .
 and you want these - if a ship runs into problems ,  other ships need to know about it before they risk hitting a debris field to large for their on ship solutions to cope with needing them to either decelerate for time ,  or navigate around .
 all of this makes other civilizations incredibly easy to detect if they are close enough and their arrays etc ,  if tight beam ,  are pointed in the correct direction .
 if they are too far away - then by the time they get to us ,  they are possibly interfered with enough and mixed in enough with other sources that we can &apos;t hear it and determine what it is ,  or where it comes from .
 in addition - if their species is pre-industria ,  we won &apos;t hear them .
 if they are behind a massive nebula with young forming stars we might not hear them .
 if they are on the other side of the galactic core we can &apos;t see or hear them ,  pretty well no matter how loud their broadcasts .
 and finally ,  the most and largest reason the federation no-contact policy fails: in a civilization where space ships are fairly attainable ,  it takes a single individual or single group that deems technologically uplifting a civilization is worth the risk of imprisonment knowing that their first contact and sharing of information will immortalize them in that civilizations eyes .
 and for perspective - startrek year 2400 give or take would reasonably have a human population in the range of 900 billion .
 and this is before factoring in all the other species populating the galaxy which may very well pushes the total into the quadrillions range .
 perhaps the best answer to the fermi paradox is - humans are possibly a fast track progression relative to most ,  and ,  no one has gained the population and technological means to build a society that is loud enough .
 on top of this - even if there are more civilizations out there starting to push massive radio signals into the cosmos ,  the propagation time to reach us is still limited by the speed of light and - it is rather possible ,  that the signals that prove other civilizations exist ,  simply have yet to reach us and may be another thousand or more years before they do .
 \\just some pennies worth of thought .
 this was my first thought to the top comment .
  ford visits earth .
  the president of the galaxy visits .
  earth was a playground for bored aliens .
 those little fuckers never listen !
 i won &apos;t ,  just like i don &apos;t question bugs .
 we did send them unsolicited nudes and a mix tape .
 i’d be weirded out too .
 do you think the bugs have any understanding that we are attempting to communicate ?
 it could be the same for us .
 paging zefram cochrane .
 any techno signature that leads another party to believe we can actually show up on their doorstep should do .
 warp tech ,  solomon epstein drive ,  whatever .
 my money’s on warp .
 prime directive is clearly invoked as being important only when it &apos;s convenient to the plot lol
 dramatic selection bias .
 not much story to tell when the everybody follows the rules .
 tng covered 7 years of time ,  but we only saw a handful of missions the enterprise participated in that involved the senior crew .
 such an agreement to not contact earth would only hold up if there were nothing of value on the planet .
 implying that earth lacks culture and significant amounts of natural resources .
 in other words ,  somewhere there must be planets of pure metal (gold ,  platinum ,  silver ,  copper ,  lithium ,  zinc) and planets with massive libraries of books & movies .
 i like to think they have comic books .
 could you imagine us pissing off a race like that of the klingons ?
 then they come back now and be like   .
  &apos;dammit ,  it &apos;s full of mold !
 we &apos;re on broil now
 i don’t know why ,  but this was the funniest thing i’ve read in a few days .
  &apos;yo somebody send a big rock at this mf this place is whack &apos;
 that would be very ,  very unlikely .
 basically ,  evolution does not (necessarily) favor intelligence or more complex life; it favors whatever works .
 so if you came to the planet during the jurassic and saw the plant and animal life then - you could make no judgement about the future evolution of those plants and animals .
 they could evolve into intelligent creatures ,  they could stay the same (if it ain &apos;t broke ,  don &apos;t fix it) ,  they could become stupider (koalas) ,  they could even go extinct (as many did) .
 even if an animal has the potential to evolve great intelligence ,  there is no guarantee it will ,  or that intelligence will be of a useful or interesting sort .
 dolphins are very smart but they don &apos;t have meaningful technology ,  and their  &apos;culture &apos; is quite ephemeral (as an example)
 what if there is something that can force a big rip via advanced technology ,  and we constantly live in a cyclic universe .
 everytime an intelligent species reaches a certain level of technology ,  they accidentally reset the universe .
 maybe the invention of the time machine will cause us to reset the universe .
 believe it or not ,  it &apos;s less improbable than you think .
  as far as humans understand how long it takes intelligent life to evolve and what conditions are required ,  we &apos;re almost as early as we could possibly be .
  the planet we live on ,  and the others we can see through various observations ,  is likely part of the first generation of planets that heavy elements can exist on simply based on the age of the planet compared to the age of the universe .
 read  &apos;forever peace &apos; by haldeman if you haven &apos;t .
 sounds like mass effect .
 the reapers will kill us when we become smart enough to inhabit other planets
 that is one helluva filter .
 have you played the outer wilds ?
 he said the dinosaurs had attitude problems .
 harry turtledove wrote a series where these aliens send a probe to earth that gets here in the year 1200 .
  they take several hundred years to prepare to take over .
 they show up in 1942 when the entire world is geared for war and have a lot more advanced equipment than swords and bows .
  &apos;oh look ,  the apes have learned how to throw bigger turds !
 maybe aliens seeing we figured out nukes is similar when primatologists see a primate species using spears .
 it &apos;s a huge discovery for that species but to us its archaic .
 it wouldnt matter though .
 even just assuming they have no actual weapons  they could still just drop rocks ( any small rocky asteroid etc) at us that we would barely see coming ,  couldnt do much about ,  and only a few need to hit us to wipe us out .
  when it comes to extra planetary weapons nukes are sort of meh .
 i think askreddit threads are more about creating an interesting conversation than spreading information .
 i’m glad it was posted so i could read that wiki page though ,  been on reddit for 5 years now and i’ve just come across that
 them calling the earth by its latin name implies the romans really did end up conquering the galaxy
 nah they &apos;d name us like  &apos;saff332076 &apos; bc scientists hate everyone
 i know you meant planet terra as a translation to latin but you really fucked my portuguese speaking brain there for a second ,  dude lmao .
 terra is portuguese for earth
 there &apos;s a whole book series with kind of an opposite view ,  it has the premise that humans are the most vicious and dangerous species in the universe  &apos;the damned trilogy &apos; by alan dean foster and aliens try to use us for their own wars .
 how many times have we destroyed/enslaved/ruined the lives of other humans ,  that posed no threat to us ,  simply because we had superior technology t them ?
 and felt no guilt over it ?
 or we are the assignment ,  created by some middle school kid who had to populate a planet for his midterm .
 would explain the sloppiness .
  &apos;oi ,  i &apos;m gonna stick this lead pipe right up it &apos;s butthole .
 that &apos;ll piss it off !
 this guy deserves gold .
 “and now i’m gonna stick my thumb up it’s butthole !
 i &apos;m in this post and i don &apos;t like it .
 oi hes a big one !
 that &apos;s not that old !
 i’m over 200 million light years away from the nearest hospital  ,  so i need to be real careful jammin’ my thumb in is butt’ole
 i also like the notion that our common depiction of aliens is thin ,  hairless ,  bipedal creatures with big heads and technology we can &apos;t even fathom creating .
 same way apes perceive humans .
 so advanced that they might be playing half life 3 already .
 ok i never thought of 2% dna in the  &apos;human &apos; direction .
 i now feel like i was genetically ripped off .
 that we can hypothesise and understand that there might be life out there willfully ignoring us because we &apos;re too stone age for them suggests that we think we are ready .
 if they deem us not worthy imagine how far ahead they really are .
 or what if we &apos;re the advanced ones ?
 but we as humans only test a tiny fraction of ants/monkeys/whatever .
 most of them really haven &apos;t encountered humans .
 you &apos;re assuming we just happen to be the ants that aliens decided to use for science ?
 every day on my way to work i walk past a bunch of ants .
 i do things their ant brains cannot understand .
 i don’t try to talk to their leader .
 i could give them access to more food than they can ever consume ,  but i don’t .
 mostly i ignore them .
 if they get in my way i might destroy their entire world .
 oh yeahh ,  stick your finger in my thresher
 yeah and they squeeze and blow the flurbons too .
 we demand a satisfying conclusion to single female lawyer
 pretty sure this is a comic my grandpa forwarded me .
  &apos;ooo they have nuclear technology !
 they &apos;ve finally unlocked green power &apos; .
  &apos;nah bro they just made weapons out of it &apos;
 here he is ,  the biggest douche of the universe !
 in all the galaxies ,  there &apos;s no bigger douche than you !
 you &apos;ve reached the top ,  the pinnacle of douchedom !
 good going ,  douche .
 your dreams have come true !
 i &apos;m not a douche !
 pinewood derby is the episode where aliens cut off earth from the rest of the universe
 even if they wanted to ,  they couldn &apos;t come to the sol system ,  though .
 our mass relay was frozen inside pluto .
 in fact i don &apos;t think the council even knew about humans until we booted up our relay .
 wait ‘til you see what _they_ think he looked like
  &apos;jah &apos;ovak died for your sins ,  puny earthlings !
 convert ,  or face eternal damnation in the fiery depths of space hell !
 which is not to different from your planet ,  actually .
 plus solar systems are all far away from each other ,  much like atoms are all apart from each other .
 my main problem with this idea is that atoms aren &apos;t really like that - it &apos;s just the best compromise between being correct and simple enough for the average person to understand .
 once you get beyond high school things like quantum physics take over and you realise pretty much everything you think you know about atoms and subatomic particles are wrong .
 tldr electrons don &apos;t really behave like we &apos;re told they do in high school ,  they &apos;re basically energy fields that sometimes act like particles .
 this was a plot of an episode of stargate atlantis
 are we talking about aliens or politicians ?
 or political aliens ?
 if aliens abducted humans ,  we would be pretty hostile too
 did we give the hostages anal probes and send them back ?
 very interesting/ depressing story .
 also makes you triple hate that asshole preacher who wanted to go visit them .
 he either was aware of their history and still tried to contact them ,  or he lied about doing his research and tried to contact them anyway .
 i won &apos;t type  &apos;he deserved to be killed by them &apos; ,  but the outcome shouldn &apos;t be surprising .
 but what if we are from the alien &apos;s standpoint ,  the krogan .
 a species who &apos;s only foreseeable purpose is emergency killing machines .
 a highly intelligent ,  social ,  tool-using organism that evolved to use symbolic language would have no interest in exploring the stars if it had no eyes and lived at the bottom of a methane ocean .
 and frankly ,  it &apos;s possible that other planets that are similar to ours and have followed a similar trajectory have destroyed themselves and left their planet to the  &apos;lesser &apos; creatures that are not capable of such destruction physically or mentally - which is my general assumption as to what will happen to us in the next few hundred years .
 turns out the  &apos;asteroid &apos; that killed the dinosaurs was actually just a nuke .
 on earth we do ,  but maybe not other civilizations .
 perhaps aliens learned to observe and avoid warring planets like ours until we get our shit together .
 or they follow the prime directive
 if there are aliens with the technology to be monitoring us ,  do you know how much further advanced they’d have to be ?
  it would be like albert einstein trying time talk to a salamander .
 the last vestiges of intelligent life .
 down big in the 4th quarter .
 can we pull it off ?
 on the bright side there could be a bunch of cool alien ruins from lost civilizations to explore .
 what do you mean last ?
 the universe is not even 20 billion years old .
 the sun has been around for roughly 1/3 to 1/4 of the entire duration of the universe .
 so far ,  we estimate that stellar creation will continue for several trillion more years .
 we are ,  by all accounts ,  in the infancy of this reality .
 what theory is this ?
 flashy lights and strong bass tones .
 spielberg figured that out decades ago .
 even if we use humans as an analog ,  look how far we &apos;ve come in the last 100 years compared to the last 100 , 000 .
 this might be the first time i have seen someone want sauce for something other than porn
 tfw all the aliens that visited us were radicals
 that’s a big brain play right there
 i instantly thought of of roy too
 this guys taking roy off the grid !
 he has no social security number for roy !
  &apos;rick and morty &apos; for the uninitiated .
 haha that episode was a mindfuck
 i didn’t it was right up top for lil ole me
 we’ve put up the requisite signage and filed the paperwork .
 it’s your own fault you didn’t look .
 imagine they could have a poetry for it .
 hi sorry about that .
 i &apos;m listening now .
 thanks for the silver !
 we have a pretty good understanding on the cognitive abilities and limitations of bugs though .
 any alien species that &apos;s smart enough to have space travel would be curious enough to figure out exactly how much we understand ,  and communicate within those limitations .
 just to see what we &apos;d do .
 much like how dolphins are trying to communicate with us by jumping through hoops and playing with balls .
 he should be alive by now
 nah ,  the infinite improbability drive is so much better .
 epstein drive takes 5 .
 2 years to reach the closest neighboring star .
 the drives can go a lot faster but not without killing the crew .
 lol  &apos;who stopped paying the electric ?
  &apos;way too much salt &apos;
 i personally don &apos;t think a time machine will ever be invented unless things devolve into magic ,  but i guess physics can be pretty magical .
 we &apos;re talking about some immense calculations ,  you &apos;d have to know exactly where and when in time you want to go and know exactly where earth is located .
 it &apos;s rotating and travelling around the sun ,  which is travelling around the galaxy ,  which is flying through space .
 i cannot even fathom how one would even begin doing that ,  we &apos;d have to find our exact point in space and time relative to everything else and we &apos;ll never see where everything else is due to the speed of light and all that .
 i love isaac asminov .
 i’m reading the foundation trilogy now and it’s awesome
 i read that whole thing ,  fascinating .
 what the hell is it ?
 you’re forgetting even a thousand year lead on us is going to be massive and that’s very very probable .
 imagine if we had cracked industrial age during romans .
 we’d be charting stars by now .
 there are trillions of stars and billions of planets .
 saying even 1% of them could have life and even 1% of those could be ahead of us isn’t saying much .
 but in terms of probability that’s high
 i understand this hypothesis ,  but it &apos;s trivial for a billion stars to have a million-year head start .
 why isnt our moon quantum ,  it sucks
 wait ,  but don &apos;t dinosaurs still exist in dragonball ?
 what book/series is that ?
 sounds hella interesting
 he wrote a short story similar to this called  &apos;the road not traveled &apos; .
 in it he posits that ftl is easy and we(earth) somehow missed discovering it causing us to advance tech many civs don &apos;t have .
 when we are invaded by aliens with 18th century tech ,  they cannot comprehend our violence and inadvertently give us ftl tech .
 if they just reached 30 years later it  would be a lot more cooler .
  &apos;the apes have discovered how to throw long term damage turds &apos;
 i was thinking it &apos;d be along the lines of if you went to the bug exhibit and found a dung beetle with a handgun .
 it &apos;s not as bad as we can do ,  but still concerning that he got that far .
 you have to call earth terra .
 attention unidentified space craft ,  you are approaching the planet terra blig blop .
 they sometimes name things like  &apos;large hadron collider &apos; .
 a large hadron collider .
 or  &apos;very large array &apos; because it &apos;s a ,  yep ,  very large array .
 except jane goodall .
 i &apos;m sure alien dr goodall would name us endearing names like t &apos;pau ,  londo ,  stinkyfinger ,  or masturbatorr
 i &apos;m a programmer and names like that make sense for the way you &apos;re interaction with most of data like this .
 when it becomes something important ,  you just link an easily memorizable name to it .
 the worst part is that ridiculously specific names like that actually exist to make things less confusing
 i have to check that out .
 i spent quite some time reading stuff on r/hfy ,  but there was too much sub-par stuff to wade through in the hopes that someone did something interesting with the premise .
 i &apos;m not a student of christianity by any means but genesis 6:7 is a powerful verse .
 after witnessing the horrors that man is capable of god said: .
 ‘i will wipe from the face of the earth the human race i have created – and with them the animals ,  the birds and the creatures that move along the ground – for i regret that i have made them .
 or we were made by his older brother and he is the destructive chaotic little brother ,  he’s also responsible for 2020
 a student who procrastinated on reddit and now is panicking because he is really late .
 wait i am describing my current situation !
 “‘ight ,  he actually really likes it .
 it seems to be enjoying it !
 the first moan i &apos;ve heard from this species .
 who is this  &apos;daddy &apos; ?
 there you go ,  merry christmas
 man i miss him .
 his wife and children are living legends .
 they give me hope for humanity .
 aw he &apos;s really pissed off now !
 oh yea that really pissed it off !
 i think it &apos;s appealing to think this is reality ,  that there is something higher .
 because if it turned out we were the only planet with life ,  and humans were leading the pack ,  that would be something nobody wants to be true .
 reddit has this weird double-standard where practically nobody advocates for the idea of humans being it ,  but everyone acts like it &apos;s the thing people believe by default .
 if you drop god and aliens out of the equation ,  nobody wants to solve it ,  and definitely nobody wants to believe the conclusion .
 we &apos;re so disappointed in ourselves that we don &apos;t want to be in first place .
 no one could possibly be that advanced .
 space valve and space gabe still won &apos;t make hl3 .
 you’re already the maximum amount of human .
 changing our dna any further ,  even including beneficial mutations ,  would be speciation ,  resulting in something less human .
 the us government has done multiple studies on this and found every time that we &apos;re not ready at all .
 that it would cause worldwide societal collapse .
 also heavily hinted that it would cause technological disruptions to the market simply because we would now know that whatever insane propulsion method they use is actually possible ,  with the heavily implied point that it would hurt the oil industry and thus the us government primary position as the lone superpower .
 they don &apos;t have to share anything with us or even communicate with us in any way for all of that to happen .
 the fact is the leaders we have would never admit that other civilizations exist if they ever learned that they do ,  our leaders care much more about the status quo than they do about achieving anything for all of humanity .
 the biggest argument in those studies (ngl i just read the summaries) was that it would cause people to start viewing other humans differently .
 instead of seeing a soviet person and thinking of them as an opponent to america we would just see them as another human .
 our fundamental understanding of what is possible would change dramatically .
 the differences between a russian and a european seem kinda silly once we know aliens exist .
 disclosure of alien life would be one of the biggest events in human history ,  comparable with discovering fire and agriculture .
 all of a sudden we &apos;re no longer the most powerful thing we know of ,  and that &apos;s something that many world leaders will not be able to come to terms with easily .
 if true ,  this would be extremely sad for the universe as a whole .
 us humans being the advanced civilization ,  when we can &apos;t even get along and work for a common goal ,  would be a complete travesty .
 where would you suggest starting to learn more about this ?
 we also have a special protector in jupiter .
 the wide lad catches a lot of projectiles hurtled at us that would cause mass extinction events .
 the dinos weren’t so lucky ,  unless the voth from star trek: voyager are really out there somewhere .
 one crazy thing is how soon life formed after the earth finished forming .
 the earth is 4 .
 54 billion years old ,  and that specifically refers to the formation of the core ,  they believe it took from a few up to 100 million years for the total accretion of all the rest of the matter that makes up the earth ,  and it wasn’t until about 4 .
 5 billion years ago that the crust actually solidified .
 the earliest direct evidence of life is 3 .
 5 billion years ago ,  but there is evidence of life even earlier ,  with some estimates putting it as starting 4 .
 4 billion years ago ,  which is super close to when the earth became a plausible place for life to exist .
 i mean honestly it sounds like you’re describing the population that claim to experience abduction .
 a fraction of people that it happens to .
 that we don’t believe .
 this stuff right here ,  this is what lovecraft was on about .
 it &apos;s not that the terrors from beyond the borders of reality want to reduce our brains to gibbering madness ,  it &apos;s just that we are so inconsequential to them that they don &apos;t notice us at all as they go about their inscrutable tasks .
 how much for you to squeeze and blow my flurbon earthling ?
 surely you know mcneal .
 she is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male &apos;s world .
 oh nooooo ,  not finland .
 somebody better break the news to norway ,  they were close .
 has babyfart mcgeezak visited yet ?
 they became aware of humanity when the turian &apos;s caught humans trying to boot up another inactive relay
 i didnt even remember that part .
 now i want to replay mass effect .
 ya kinda my point about the empty space thing .
 99% of an atom is empty .
 99% of the universe is empty .
 def some correlations .
 depends who they take though
 maybe they were kidnapped and put in zoos like what happened to other tribes .
 in this century they just study them ,  take their blood and return them .
 no anal probes .
 even the krogan got uplifted tho
 maybe stupid question from smoothebrane me ,  but how do we know that &apos;s not what we &apos;re detecting ?
 ava how do we know that background radiation wasn &apos;t lower before velociraptor chernobyl or whatever ?
 in a couple of hundred years ,  we could nuke ourselves with an asteroid .
 or the more scary answer is that most other species was wiped out in a massive war and the only ones left are to busy not dying off to fuck around with earth .
 i think he means the dark forest theory answer for the fermi paradox  from the three body problem books
 only if einstein was smart enough ,  he could ve learnt to regrow cut limbs
 is brady the qb ?
 we &apos;re saved if he is
 after 8 _billion_ years (and assuming a good few million light years to get there) i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s left to explore .
 i was wondering about that ,  too .
 i mean ,  the study’s by the jpl ,  and they usually know their stuff .
 maybe they mean the average civilization would’ve existed at 8 billion years- picture a bell curve with a peak at 8 billion years ,  but that tapers out towards the distant future .
 turns out their species is all epileptic and sensitive to vibrations ,  and we just hit them with the equivalent of weapons
 mfw i don’t get a hot alien gf because chad gramps killed a space cultist .
 i didn &apos;t know roy 2 was out yet .
 we were making hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy references this whole time and just waiting for u/sanguwon to figure it out .
 oh freddled gruntbuggly ,  .
 thy micturations are to me ,  .
 as plurdled gabbleblotchits ,  in midsummer morning .

 its earted jurtles ,  grumbling .
 into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer .
 now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles ,  .
 are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts ,  .

 and hooptiously drangle me ,  .
 with crinkly bindlewurdles ,  mashurbitries .
 or else i shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon ,  .
 this is making the assumption that human levels of intelligence are rare and noteworthy .
 there is of course a chance that what we’ve achieved is relatively common or even behind the curve and there is basically no reason to be interested in it .
 we could be the galactic equivalent of subspecies of house flies with a one sentence wikipedia article which merely acknowledges our existence .
 no he isn’t born until 2030 .
 i can &apos;t remember; when are the eugenics wars ?
 the piers anthony book macroscope has a ship’s crew discover alien technology capable of liquefying the crew during extreme acceleration ,  then reconstitute them upon arrival .
 at 1 g it would take 4 .
 1 years with half trip speeding up and half slowing down
 humanity would be the jackasses who run wild with omega particles ,  figuring out a way to harness the energy ,  even as we pollute the galaxy .
 oh good ,  they’ve learned how to microwave a planet  !
 a lot of people think a time machine doesn &apos;t exist because if it did we would &apos;ve met a time traveler by now .
 i think it &apos;s called the time traveler &apos;s paradox or something like that .
 i feel like trajectory physics would be the least complicated part of time travel .
 calculating when and where to go would be trivial compared to everything else involved in time travel .
 you really think the thing holding scientists back from traveling back in time is determining the precise location and orientation of the earth at some point in the past ?
 we &apos;ve had equations to calculate that for centuries .
 there is nothing in known physics preventing time travel .
 forward time travel is simply the application of time distortion (general relativity .
 ) spend time near a black hole and time will slow down for you ,  but speed up for everyone else .
 it is effectively time travel to the future .
 backward time travel is potentially possible through a wormhole given known physics .
 form two ends of a worm hole and accelerate one end to 99% of the speed of light .
 the other end remains stationary .
 you now have a pathway from the future to the past as well as from the past to the future .
 and yes ,  that may produce a paradox .
 it is not known how the universe prevents time travel paradoxes .
 the problem with the worm hole is how to maintain a stable worm hole ,  which requires producing negative energy to resist its tendency to close .
 it &apos;s analogous to trying to open a person sized tube under the ocean .
 the pressure of the water wants to squeeze the tube closed .
 it &apos;s not known how negative energy can be produced .
 but fyi ,  it &apos;s more than just a trilogy .
 and i &apos;ve recently been discovering that asimov has a bunch of stories that i found pretty interesting .
 might i suggest you read  &apos;i ,  robot &apos; next .
 and then  &apos;prelude to foundation &apos; and  &apos;forward the foundation &apos; .
 interstellar travel may be an impossible nut to crack ,  or if it can ,  might be extremely slow ,  requiring massive generational ships that are incredibly resource intensive for any civilization willing to attempt it .
 i &apos;m not sure humans would be up to the task of a journey that takes thousands of years with the people who are expected to finish it possibly losing the context of the mission entirely .
 it would be very easy for those crews to succumb to infighting and destroy themselves before reaching the goal .
 i don &apos;t like this idea ,  but it &apos;s a reality we need to face .
 leaving our solar system as a species might not be nearly as easy as science fiction likes to paint it .
 there are a lot of good responses ,  and i can &apos;t reply to all of them ,  but i would point out to those that are saying interstellar travel could be easy because our understanding of the science needed is incomplete or whatever ,  this brings us back to the fermi paradox .
 if stellar colonization is that easy ,  we should see evidence of it .
 the problem is that too many people are looking at it at any given time
 that &apos;s also the explanation for the demons in the original 90s doom novels ,  which are surprisingly readable .
 basically the demons are aliens that evolve very slowly ,  and assume that by looking like demons from the middle ages ,  they &apos;ll be equally terrifying to modern humans .
 nukes might even be able to deal great damage to even those advanced aliens
 i’m loving the image of this i’m getting in my head right now
 sol 3 would also be acceptable .
  &apos;talk about low self-esteem; those humans came up with a word that means  &apos;dirt &apos; and then that &apos;s what they called their planet !
 i prefer  &apos;eeeearth &apos; from lilo and stitch .
  &apos; you &apos;re lucky a traflorkian doesn &apos;t hear you say that .
 ooh haha ,  the little one on  &apos;reddit &apos; guessed it !
 what are the odds of that ,  glorplord ?
 in this verse god is admitting that he made a mistake (regrets) in making man .
 where i live ,  the holy-roller types love to work into any conversation “god never makes a mistake” .
 when i bring up this particular verse it makes them mad .
 you should read the bhagavad gita and perhaps the mahabharata
 sorry god ,  i &apos;m gonna have to give you a d+ on this .
 your humans are very slow developing and don &apos;t have very high intelligence .
 you are the real g brother a happy holidays to you man
 wow dude ,  paying this forward now .
 thanks toggleoften ,  ya bugger ,  lol .
 merry christmas to you too .
 much love from canada .
 and a happy new year .
 he died the way he lived .
 with animals in his heart .
 i wouldn &apos;t say we are disappointed in ourselves exactly ,  i think it &apos;s more of a manifestation of the desire to be greater ,  to improve ourselves from what we are right now .
 we think up beings greater than ourselves because that &apos;s where we want to be ,  for better or worse .
 that &apos;s just my theory .
 whatever it might be though ,  we definitely seem to be inclined to imagining higher powers for some reason .
 because if it turned out we were the only planet with life ,  and humans were leading the pack ,  that would be something nobody wants to be true .
 reddit has this weird double-standard where practically nobody advocates for the idea of humans being it ,  but everyone acts like it &apos;s the thing people believe by default .
 personally i’d be fine with this outcome .
 more than fine in fact .
 this makes the galaxy terra nullius for humanity .
 nothing to oppose us ,  we can surge across the disk ,  writing our incomprehensible future as we go .
 each of us living today a member of the progenitor race that came first ,  our every action meaningful in some way to that future history .
 when it comes to the biggest issues of our time ,  our species is procrastinating like crazy .
 we want to be saved by gods/aliens because we don &apos;t really want to put in the work ourselves .
 assuming that we are among the first wouldn &apos;t just add more pressure ,  but also require us to take reponsibility on a much bigger scale (how do we approach less advanced species ,  how do we deal with mostly uninhabitated yet habitable (for us) worlds ,  etc) - but at the same time ,  we are aware that this isn &apos;t a responsibility we want simply because we have failed in that regard already on our own planet .
 if there were gods/aliens we would hope to be guided to a certain extent ,  but if that &apos;s not the case ,  we might have to figure things out ourselves and possibly become the guiding light for other species as well .
 and we are far from ready ,  thus we still clinge to ideas that provide us with comfort .
 being among the first would be like a young human (partying hard ,  still exploring themselves ,  trying to fuck around as much as possible ,  etc) who suddenly has to take care for an unplanned child .
 if we are among the first ,  we will have to change our ways drastically .
 our species does not have the mindset it takes to be a good example and a teacher for those relying on our  &apos;parenting skills &apos; .
 we are so divided ,  sabotaging each other all the time - it would only have negative impact on alien species .
 it would be like two immature narcissists fighting over custody ,  resulting in a destructive/manipulative/exploitative environment for the child .
 because if it turned out we were the only planet with life .
 i feel like the odds of this are so low that it would basically be proof of god
 this is beyond science !
 what about that song  &apos;more human than human &apos; ?
 if you &apos;re trying to tell me you know more about science than rob zombie ,  i &apos;m calling bullshit .
 it &apos;s crazy isn &apos;t it .
 i think generally thinking about life elsewhere in the universe is one of those  &apos;well duh of course there is ,  how could there not be ?
  &apos; kind of thinking for many people ,  but if it were genuinely confirmed it &apos;d be fucking mental .
 and if they were way more advanced than us of course we would have a meltdown .
 i think many people do think we &apos;re ready just because &apos; oh yeah billions of planets there &apos;s definitely life &apos; but actually encountering it changes everything .
 can i have the summaries you read please ?
 this sounds interesting .
 astronauts who visit space report a similar effect .
 after seeing the earth from space they report a new feeling of seeing us all as one united species and it trivializes things like countries and borders to them .
 unless they are slightly more advanced than us ,  like a few hundred years ,  it doesn &apos;t really matter .
 if technological grow is exponential ,  we couldn &apos;t comprehend anything that &apos;s a million let alone a billion years more advanced than us .
 we also know that fusion is a thing but we still have gas powered cars .
 exactly ,  and that would seem to suggest that life is the rule ,  not the exception ,  as it seems to happen wherever possible ,  and in the grand scheme of thing ,  life on earth probably happened relatively soon after the universe formed .
 we may be more toward the leading edge of advanced civilizations ,  rather than billions of years behind other worlds .
 it &apos;s a really interesting thing to think about .
 i believe the council only became aware when the turians started gearing up for war after their defeat over shanxi .
 a patrol fleet is much easier to hide than large scale mobilisation after all .
 (i &apos;ll admit i do go fully mega nerd every time i see the first contact war mentioned .
 good news they are releasing remasters of the og trilogy early next year
 our universe is in a marble in a coat hanging in a locker
 i think they kidnapped 2 old people and 2 children to  &apos;spoil &apos; them with food and alcohol and fancy stuff and then send them back to tell the tribe the europeans are peaceful .
 then the old people got sick and died so yea
 only out of galactic crisis due to the rachni ,  iirc .
 if not for a monstrous threat that demanded a monstrous response ,  the citadel races probably would have left the krogan to their own devices .
 so the only way we &apos;d enjoy a sudden uplifting is if the galactic community feels like we &apos;re best suited to help with a very particular problem
 it also looks like we breed like the krogan
 not a stupid question at all !
 this is a fascinating topic that is well worth delving into .
 technically i &apos;m a scientist but my background in physics is purely on a hobbyist level so please bear with me if this isnt clear .
 to answer this first we have to go into what exactly an isotope ratio is .
 all the heaviest elements in the universe are created by either supernovae or neutron star collision .
 during these titanic events new elements are created from lighter elements that are bombarded with protons and neutrons .
 the heaviest of these new heavy elements are unstable and will eventually spontaneously break apart into lighter elements in a process we call radioactive decay .
 isotopes are versions of an element that have varying numbers of neutrons .
 these differing amounts of neutrons affect the decay rate of an unstable element and each isotope has an exact decay rate (or half life) that is constant .
 in nature these isotopes exist in extremely specific ratios called their natural abundance that is based on their ratio in the primordial cloud that formed the solar system .
 now because these isotopes have different decay rates this natural abundance ratio changes over time but at any specific time any natural deposit of such a substance will have the exact same ratio .
 currently any given hunk of uranium on earth that has not undergone enrichment will have 0 .
 because we dont find any uranium (with the exception of the oklo deposit) on earth with a different isotopic ratio than this we can be confident that no previous civilizations were fucking around with atomic energy and enriching or processing uranium .
 the same concept applies to all of the naturally occurring primordial radioactive elements (elements that have been on earth since it formed) .
 this is a good segue into the naturally occurring non primordial radioactive elements .
 since the earth is roughly 4 point something billion years old any elements with a half life significantly shorter than this should have long disappeared .
 any that we find on earth must be created by some process .
 lets use one of my favorite little isotopic fuckers carbon 14 for example .
 it is a radio active isotope of carbon created by the sun &apos;s rays hitting the atmosphere .
 since it is chemically identical to normal carbon it is taken up by carbon based life forms (all life on earth) as they grow .
 when things die they stop taking in carbon 14 .
 we can then dig up their bones ,  measure how much carbon 14 is left ,  and determine when the thing died based on the half life of carbon 14 .
 that &apos;s how carbon dating works .
 that was a bit of a tangent because carbon dating is awesome but my basic point is that we can explain the origin of any of these non primordial radioactive substances we find on earth .
 even for non primordial radioactive elements that come from things like atomic bombs or power plant accidents we can tell when they were created based on their half life and isotopic abundance .
 because we dont find any isotopic ratios we can &apos;t explain we must accept the null hypothesis and conclude that there were no previous civilizations on earth that used atomic technology .
 or in layman &apos;s terms the dude above is completely and totally 100% wrong because science .
 because some isotopes aren &apos;t naturally occuring .
 plus ,  there &apos;s the planets worth of untapped fossil fuels we monkeys lucked into .
 coal specifically is a one and done fuel source that &apos;s entirely non-renewable in nature on any time scale .
  &apos;rods from god &apos; we could do that now .
 that &apos;s what i was going to say ,  the black forest fermented body theory book thingy
 nothing much at all .
 unless they built something on a dead rock that was tectonically inactive with a dead core .
 no atmosphere of any kind to limit weathering ,  and then anything on the surface would have had to survive billions of years of nothing from space striking the surface that would destroy or cover the ruins .
 better chance of finding some sort of space junk floating in a dead/graveyard orbit or such around their star .
 i can only imagine what a few billions years of solar wind and radiation would do however .
 yeah ,  i was gonna say would be then i was like  &apos;eeehhhh 8 billion eh ?
 maybe not so many .
  &apos; but hey i mean space junk and stuff might last that long .
 maybe even some things on barren planets with no atmosphere or even just stuff from later civilizations not quite from the height of intelligent life .
 too bad weve already marked him for termination to make room for the space drive highway
 took 7 years to find him .
 wow he &apos;s only 33 in first contact ?
 must &apos;ve had a hard life .
 the actor was 56 when the movie was made
 10 years until zephram is a common name .
 on the same note ,  i heard a theory that it was a shadow war-thing ,  playing out in the background of the major conflicts of the time .
 also helps to explain the discrepancy between the eugenics timeframe and that one episode of voyager when they went to la in the 90s .
 thanks ,  i &apos;m buying that book just on that concept alone .
 i mean there are multiple paradox that show why time travel to the past is never going to happen .
 i can &apos;t remember the show but stephen hawking discussed this in it .
 maybe all those ufos ,  who are so determined to not be seen or contacted ,  are time travellers .
 they don &apos;t want to interact with us because they don &apos;t want to affect the time line in any way .
 santa is the first ,  and the last ,  time traveler; it &apos;s how he moves so fast .
 once he realized he was stuck in his own paradox of motivation ,  he decided to try something he &apos;d never thought .
 with his invention he now had the power .
 then he realized he had to protect the human epoch from other travelers .
 for 364 days a year he sabotages time machines ,  and dispatches successful travelers .
 what if there are just a bunch of dead time travelers floating in space because they got the time right but didnt take into account the earth &apos;s rotation ?
 i think the time traveler paradox is ridiculous for a few reasons .
 it presumes any society with time travel has no rules about interference with the timeline .
 why should we assume if a time traveler was here ,  they &apos;d announce it and supply proof ?
 also ,  why do we assume our tiny little blip would be interesting enough to visit ?
 say time travel is possible ,  but so incredibly difficult we don &apos;t achieve it for another billion years (or more accurately ,  a descendant of our species achieves it) .
 if they visited any time in the past outside of recorded history ,  we wouldn &apos;t know unless they buried proof somewhere ,  which seems unlikely .
 good records of civilization are even younger .
 really only perhaps 1000 years ,  before that a large footprint is rare .
 so there could have been visits ,  but they weren &apos;t recorded in surviving records .
 and ,  any visit happening after now but before 1bn years wouldnt be known yet .
 bottom line ,  the 4 billion years since life developed ,  and if it &apos;s another billion before the machine ,  what &apos;s so special about this 5000 year blip that it would attract visitors ?
 especially if time travel exists but is extraordinarily difficult and energy intensive ,  making trips uncommon and only for something super important .
 and as important as recent history may seem to us ,  i suspect the far future may disagree .
 once holden opens the ring gates ,  it will be much smoother sailing
 whenever ppl comment on topics like this ,  i always remember these old magazines from the 50s and 60s ,  where they would draw what the future would be like .
 they said in the future ,  people would be able to play chess with someone from the other side of the planet by using automated chess boards ,  using radio communication ,  so when i make a move in my board .
 the other board would replicate my move .
 that &apos;s trying to see the future using your present as a baseline .
 they just had no idea .
 we can &apos;t talk about what will be possible or not in the future .
 it &apos;s just innocent .
 might be extremely slow ,  requiring massive generational ships .
 i read something whose ideas i remember ,  but numbers i will misquote .
 basically said the first ships to head off to a new star wouldn &apos;t be the first to make it .
 by the time humanity could reasonably undertake that trip - let &apos;s say it &apos;ll take 100 years for simplicity &apos;s sake - ten years later it may only take 50 .
 so ,  in 2050 you and your crew head off to a new system ,  planning to arrive 2150 as pioneers .
 in 2060 another crew heads off and they will get there a full 40 years before you .
 leave home on the bleeding edge; arrive outdated .
 this is the series were the alien race took over australia because it was the continent most similar to their homeworld ,  right ?
 not to mention their addiction to ginger .
 that sounds kind of amazing actually .
 it &apos;s a solid strategy actually .
 up until fairly recently (on a historical scale) ,  modelling armour on terrifying animals or demons has been fairly common around the world .
 it &apos;s just a shame for the demons that they found the one guy that took their terrifying appearance as a challenge .
 plus ,  psychologically speaking ,  it &apos;s much easier to shoot something that doesn &apos;t look human than something that does .
 wow just like irl !
 if independence day has taught us anything ,  it &apos;s that we need to infect them with a primitive windows 95 virus first !
 interstellar travel requires shielding which can dissipate many terajoules of kinetic energy at a time .
 even a half gram pebble traveling at 87% of the speed of light will impact with the yield of a 9 kiloton bomb .
 you would need your hull to be able to withstand that kind of punishment in case your energy shields failed .
 the independence day aliens had completely inadequate shields to withstand interstellar travel .
  &apos;tf you lookin &apos; at ,  ape-man ?
 move along before i bust a cap in your ass .
 for the emperor aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 even calling the planet  &apos;sol &apos; is human-centric .
 they &apos;d have their own name for our sun ,  which we would refer to as sol .
 if we come into contact officially ,  they might eventually adopt our name for the star ,  out of respect .
 just like if we found a civilization orbiting betelguese and they called their star  &apos;f &apos;aia &apos; ,  then we &apos;d start calling it  &apos;f &apos;aia &apos;
 and named every other planet after a god of some kind .
 prepare to be analysed
 there’s no way glorplord isn’t some sort of intergalactic slur right ?
 can you believe that little fucking glorplord guessed the name right ?
 they still fight over oil !
 mary:  &apos;why is my all-knowing son get a d ?
 it &apos;s his birthday today ,  let him have it .
 i demand to speak to the principal .
 and yea ,  i know you meant the other guy but it don’t feel right golding the ‘bigger anal probe’ today .
 holy shit i just got the joke .
 it turns out words can hurt .
 kardashev scale: smol brain .
 half life scale: galaxy brain
 he also knows about living dead girls .
 dude &apos;s really into biology .
 think of it like you being on a boat in the sea ,  just a short leisure trip .
 you know there must be sharks out there somewhere ,  the ocean is vast after all .
 however ,  out of nowhere you realise there are sharks nearby because you can see their fins .
 how would your mood and perception of the situation change ?
 i &apos;d say ,  it &apos;s the same thing with alien life ,  especially advanced one .
 we think we &apos;re ready because rick and morty type stuff exists .
 interactions with aliens has been normalised for years ,  whether that &apos;s on a more realistic scale or being equal to above aliens (in rick and morty &apos;s case) .
 the idea that we &apos;d just hang out or kill aliens gives us the same kind of confidence zombie movies gives us ,  that if it really happened then we &apos;d obviously be prepared because we &apos;ve seen so many scenarios .
 but then if aliens really did just show up one day ,  i have full confidence 100% of the population would have no fucking clue what to do ,  that &apos;s  &apos;you &apos;re awake !
 you &apos;ve been in a coma &apos; type mind fucking .
 not only because of what the guy you &apos;re replying to explained ,  but just because it opens up too many questions .
 not  &apos;is there life/what does it look like/what can it do/where is it &apos; but  &apos;how much more/what are they capable of/will they help us/will they control/kill us/how long have they been like this/are there higher societies in space/why now &apos; .
 i &apos;d hope the world wouldn &apos;t turn to chaos ,  but it would change everything ,  i &apos;m sure of that .
 i &apos;m interested too
 i can &apos;t blame you ,  it &apos;s like the 18th symphony when little things start flying out of the big space ship ,  and the little things aren &apos;t missiles ,  and the aliens are in full panic mode
 a fellow mib conneusseur i see
 we are being spoiled with anal probes
 oh man ,  how badass would it be for some alien race to come down and be like  &apos;ok ,  so first thing hi nice to meet you ,  second we &apos;ve got a bit of a problem and you guys are actually the biggest bunch of warmongering bastards we know .
 so how about we trade you interstellar technology for you to come take care of this for us ?
 thanks for explaining all this and your post before this .
  it was quite interesting .
 does this imply that humans have measurably changed the ratio in some places ?
 in other words ,  if humans were to disappear then would an intelligent civilization 1 .
 7 billion years later be able to know that we existed and had fucked around with nuclear power ?
 to expand on this for anyone interested ,  the reason coal is so special is because it &apos;s composed of densely packed wood from the time when trees first evolved .
 it took a long while for bacteria that can break wood down to evolve ,  so until that point wood just built up and was gradually buried and compressed into coal .
 unless there &apos;s some event that managed to completely sterilise the planet it &apos;s very unlikely that such a thing could happen again .
 out of all the comments in here this actually made me laugh out loud
 years of warp engine radiation plus living through ww3 would age anyone prematurely .
 5 years till we get the camps from ds9 ,  which are totally believable and already kinda exist .
 check out dan simmons &apos; hyperion for a similarly horrifying concept .
 but what about visiting the past without physically travelling there  ?
 i know ,  it &apos;s even more far-fetched and improbable ,  but i find the idea of  &apos;visiting &apos; ,  just as some kinds of etheral ghosts or simple cousciousness ,  observers unable to have any impact on events ,  somehow seducing .
 time dilation and/or faster than light travel may be possible at some ,  but even the theoretical physics behind how all of that shit works is a total mind fuck .
 and then there &apos;s the whole multi-verse theory on top of all of that .
 i &apos;m getting a headache just thinking about it .
 but like ,  isn &apos;t that the same as playing chess against someone online ?
 i haven &apos;t read it in a few years ,  so i don &apos;t remember which countries were taken over ,  but yeah ,  it &apos;s the ginger one .
 i loved this series but they &apos;re definitely not for everyone .
 it &apos;s like enjoying a bad movie but in novel form .
 they &apos;re written by  &apos;dafydd ab hugh &apos; if you &apos;re interested .
 i mean at this point we could just infect them with the rona
 in the movie &apos;s defense ,  according to their lore our human computers were secretly ripped off from the computers in the crashed ufo in area 51 .
  that &apos;s why it was compatible—we were already using alien tech ,  most people just didn &apos;t know it .
 ah yes the corpse on the golden throne
 idea: warhammer 40k vs the aliens from independence day
 for the empire aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 germany has like .
 hell no ,  betelgeuse is way too dope of a name to give up .
 besides the most human thing to do would be to make them change anyway .
 did you said anal-seed ?
 yo i &apos;m thinking about this and mary is a human too .
 god created humanity ,  then had a human that he created give birth to himself ,  meaning that god is his own grandpa .
 man christianity is weird .
 i ain’t got much to offer but this free reddit award have a happy rest of the year and a great 2021
 brb ,  checking amazon for bigger golden anal probe .
 no need for reddit gold .
 there surely is a special anal probe award available .
 i agree with you on most points .
 i also think that when we discover or are discovered by sentient life they are going to look and act like nothing we could ever fathom .
 hell ,  we are carbon based life forms and their base molecule could be something completely different .
 how will we even communicate ?
 will they have mouths ?
 stuff like that fascinates me .
 and did you see how much he was drinking ?
 damn bro ,  it wasn &apos;t my millenia to pay the bill ,  this one was josh !
 ” with nick offerman .
 i’ll say nothing more so i don’t ruin it .
 the vatican won’t share their chronoscope .
 you mean like in interstellar ?
 check out the book pastwatch by orson scott card ,  the book starts with a similar premise ,  pretty good read .
 if you think about it isn &apos;t that what gazing at the stars really is ?
 when we look at the stars far away ,  we are actually seeing light that started it &apos;s travel billions of years ago .
 every time we look up at the sky ,  some of that light is from the beginning of the universe .
 isn &apos;t that basically time travel ?
 perhaps in the far future some other intelligent species will be watching earth through a telescope and reliving the history of earth and humankind .
 i watched (i think it was pbs space time ?
 ) that time travel may be possible going forward ,  but not back in time .
 still a one way track ,  just a matter of how fast you wanna travel .
 of course time dilation is interesting ,  and can  &apos;resemble &apos; time travel .
 same basic outcome ,  different thoughts on how it was achieved .
 people then couldn’t really imagine the internet as it exists today ,  so they based the future on small steps in technology instead of great leaps .
 kind of like the quote attributed to henry ford about making cars ,  something like “if i’d asked people what they wanted ,  they would’ve said faster horses .
 ” since ideas build on ideas ,  the technology that will be available by the time we can travel to other solar systems/galaxies/etc is just way beyond what we can really even think of yet .
 that &apos;s the point ,  the internet made their idea stupid .
 why try to make a stupid radio automated chess board when there &apos;s the internet and computers ?
 i think the same applies to us .
 people always says  &apos;we can &apos;t travel faster than light ,  so it &apos;s impossible to reach that planet &apos; .
 but who knows the future ?
 well that &apos;s a welsh name if i &apos;ve ever seen one .
 i loved those books .
 loved how they worked in nods to modding and deathmatch in the later books .
 basically like war of the worlds ,  but on purpose
 is covid-19 just a bat version of independence day ?
 the bats ,  tired of getting eaten and killed by humans and unable to effect a direct battle victory due to inferior weapons tech ,  decide to infect us from within .
 the poor aliens don’t stand a chance
 but it could just show that we aren &apos;t doing one thing that i mentioned .
 having respect for each other .
 that said ,  sometimes ,  we would have to change our naming for other people .
 deustchland is simply  &apos;land of the people &apos; ,  so maybe  &apos;germany &apos; is a better name for it on an international level .
 then he arranged to have his grandson killed ,  which is homicide and suicide .
 and deicide ,  and fratricide ,  and regicide .
 i didn’t need anything bro but i really appreciate the thought .
 pass on the good feels man .
 send link when found please .
 because i once looked at my elbows and thought  &apos;even these are weapons &apos; .
 the alien is beating us with his genitals !
 covid-38 is also pretty rough .
 was going on and on about some talking pig .
 it was your turn .
 i paid last millennium
 i called nick offerman and he said he didn &apos;t wanna watch it with me .
 was thinking of this precisaly .
 if we had a telescope that could see light years away with incredibly fine detail (like see what is going for a person at that distance) .
 then if we could travel to say 1 light year away instantaneously (let’s pretend) with this telescope ,  we could ,  we could see what happened exactly one year ago and watch it unfold .
 time dilation would be pretty much the way to travel forward in time .
 on a basic level you slow down your experience of time compared to the frame of reference of your destination by either going extremely fast or by being at a extremely massive object in space .
 but you can only slow down the passage of time (without you noticing any of it) you can never reverse it .
 the problem is physics moreso than human imagination and creativity though .
 everything we &apos;ve tested so far confirms that the speed of light is a hard-set rule and that it &apos;s impossible to go faster than the speed of light .
 it may ,  in principle ,  with exotic forms of matter that probably don &apos;t exist ,  be possible to manipulate space itself to travel at seemingly ftl speeds but thats something thats highly theoretical and probably doesn &apos;t exist .
 that &apos;s a war crime .
 blood for the blood god .
 skulls for the skull throne
 oh shit ,  these time travel movies are getting weirder by the minute .
 is this when the wealth starts to trickle down ?
 i promise i will bro
 i would give you one but i still don’t have enough for gold sorry
 you shut your mouth .
 username checks out
 is there still a chance that wormholes could exist and work to allow travel across vast distances ?
  is that a valid theory or just scifi ?
 that &apos;s why we don &apos;t speed our selves up ,  we just make the distance that needs to be traveled shorter
 we also thought we had physics pretty much figured out until quantum physics slapped us in the nutsack so
 the problem isn &apos;t physics but physics as we currently understand it .
 there was a time when scientists believed that no aircraft could fly past the sound barrier because of the physics that they understood
 only if the aliens are humans or if the aliens have signed the geneva convention :)
 milk for the khorne flakes
 this is the best thread i &apos;ve read all year .
 what a wholesome and lovely thread
 i hate mornings .
 i don &apos;t like waking up .
 i don &apos;t like breakfast as a genre or activity .
 i don &apos;t see a good reason to be anywhere ever before 10am .
 i started forcing myself to wake up early and go to the gym before work .
 and i hate it so much but it makes me feel so goddam good all day long .
 it &apos;s a shitty healthy dose of morning endorphins that stops me from getting sleepy after lunch ,  keeps me energized after work ,  get a better night &apos;s sleep .
 it sucks so much and it sucks even more that it improves every aspect of my day because now if i stop i know i &apos;ll just start having shitty bad days again and it &apos;ll be my dumbass lazy fault with a simple fix .
 that guy wants to settle for anything out of fear of nothing better coming later .
 that guy is okay with the dead-end job ,  the abusive relationships and no master &apos;s degree .
 i tell that guy it &apos;s never gotten me anywhere ,  it &apos;s the definition of  &apos;stuck &apos; and i have no intention of being stuck anymore .
 that guy &apos;s kicking my ass right now .
 it used to be eat cheap pizza ,  chain smoke ,  and play video games .
 i changed a lot of those habits to healthier ones .
 i used to have a little sign on my desk that said  &apos;the worst possible feeling is when the person you are meets the person you could have been .
  &apos;  it was there to encourage to pursue my goals rather than procrastinate on games ,  reddit ,  etc .
  i think it &apos;s time i dug that sign out again .
 the guy who wants to go streaking during the super bowl halftime show .
 i avoid him by remembering that prison is not a pleasant place to be .
 that guy’s cousin lives in my head ,  i go to aa meetings to avoid and outwit him .
 bold of you to assume i avoid him .
 we came to an agreement and take turns occupying the same body .
 it &apos;s me from 5:30 am  to 5pm on weekdays .
 and he gets evenings ,   weekends and holidays .
 all that guy wants to do is do reddit and play videogames .
 i don &apos;t do anything to avoid him .
 he just wants to win the lottery and sit on his couch watching dark comedies ,  drinking until it kills him .
 i avoid this by remembering that my mother would be very sad if that happened ,  and that i want to love someone ,  like really be in love ,  at least one more time before i go .
 i have the same exact same guy in my head .
 i quit smoking pot years ago ,  before i hit 30 .
 i can still stay in bed all day on some days .
 what keeps me from doing it (having a 24h lay in on my laptop) too often are commitments i &apos;ve made to myself ,  friends ,  and employers .
 back in the day pot made it really easy to give up on those commitments .
 i miss pot ,  but i don &apos;t miss those times in general ,  which keeps me from going back .
 i have chronic severe depression ,  going 25 years now .
 it &apos;s not completely clear what i have but it comes and goes (not sad ,  not bipolar ,  not mdd ,  we simply don &apos;t know and medication doesn &apos;t work) .
 however ,  it &apos;s never really gone ,  it &apos;s more like manageable or unmanageable .
 the voice is either telling me i should lie down and just give up ,  or it &apos;s telling me that soon i will be lying down and giving up again .
 my manageable moments are obviously filled with as much joy as i can pack in there ,  and every night before going to bed i tell the voice to suck it ,  today was my day ,  not yours .
 when it &apos;s unmanageable and the voice tells me to give up i try to fight him as long as i can ,  and when i start to agree with him i always manage to end it with  &apos;but not today &apos; .
 it &apos;s kept me alive for this long ,  i hope i can keep going like this for awhile .
 that guy is my adhd .
 i probably have an extreme case where my meds ,  which are at high doses ,  hardly even work anymore .
 the best way i combat this urge to do something fun ,  play games ,  or goof off is to remove myself from any place of temptation .
 cut it off before you get the thought of even doing something pleasurable .
 what i do is that i find empty classrooms at my college and study or do work in there .
 i will purposively drive away from my home (which is full of games ,  food ,  fun ,  and comfort) to a classroom just so i don’t get the urge ,  and even if i do ,  i’ve created a barrier that takes too much guilt and effort of driving back and doing something fun
 might get buried ,  but my dude in my head is literally mr .
 spock from star trek ,  and i don &apos;t avoid him .
 hear me out - i discovered through therapy that i needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and mr .
 spock is that dude .
 he can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively .
 spock:  &apos;the massive space blob has a 97 .
 454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes .
 projections show it will be slow and painful .
 kirk:  &apos;that &apos;s horrible !
 spock:  &apos;yes ,  it is not ideal for our continued survival ,  but it &apos;s actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob .
 so ,  whenever i get spun up on something in my head i imagine a mini-spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about me .
 me:  &apos;spock ,  science report .
 spock:  &apos;data shows that godspeedmetal is 5 .
 8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake .
 he isn &apos;t consciously aware of it ,  but he &apos;s attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes .
 me:  &apos;thank you ,  spock ,  sounds like i &apos;m being dishonest with myself .
 spock:  &apos;i disagree .
 it &apos;s entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake .
 this is neither good or bad .
 data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89 .
 you &apos;ve yet to procure a nicotine source as well .
 just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state ,  help sort out emotions ,  feelings ,  all that stuff ,  into a parsed ,  objective ,  and most importantly ,  non-judgemental way .
 holy shit ,  i &apos;m happy this was received as well as it was .
 this mechanism has helped myself so much ,  however i &apos;d offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don &apos;t have your expectations set correctly .
 one - spock &apos;s reports will be amended ,  appended ,  referenced and reworked entirely .
 this is all part of the process .
 even spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou .
 don &apos;t treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal .
 your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future .
 two - you will fail ,  as well ,  and that &apos;s totally ok !
 he &apos;s analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety ,  struggles with work ,  and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal .
 but sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that  &apos;getting gas &apos; was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn &apos;t come from a single analysis ,  but was referenced from a prior  &apos;science report &apos; ,  as at one point i had quit smoking ,  went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket .
 spock reported ,   &apos;godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine .
 further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal &apos;s psyche at a subconscious level .
 the strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong .
  &apos; spock doesn &apos;t judge me - it all is what it is - and i respond ,   &apos;that is fascinating !
 my mind is stranger than i ever thought possible .
 however ,  i am more in control because i now recognize this pattern of behavior .
 i believe that this can be identified at a later point if i do this again .
 thank you ,  spock .
  &apos; that failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself .
 and fyi - i &apos;m several months smoke free and still going !
 three - this isn &apos;t to make someone an emotionless logic machine ,  either - spock understands human nature is an emotional experience .
 humans get horny ,  sad ,  happy ,  angry ,  depressed ,  excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it &apos;s all part of the logic of being human .
 take that into account ,  yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally .
 four - trust your intuition .
 your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution .
 your mind is powerful and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself .
 even if you don &apos;t understand why your guts are reacting they way they are ,  don &apos;t dismiss it .
 run it by spock and if you don &apos;t come to a satisfactory answer ,  you can always revisit later when you &apos;ve more experience ,  time ,  and data .
 the guy in my head wants to lay in my pillow-top bed with soft ,  soft sheets ,  my buffy blanket ,  memory foam pillows ,  and sleep 18 hours a day (and hide from everyone) .
 punctuated by gorging myself on (good) takeout food ,  getting raving drunk ,  and just watch endless history documentaries and plan travel trips for next year .
 if that &apos;s all i did i would also probably take up smoking pot again ,  too .
 i accept that she exists ,  and love her back to health
 i relate to this .
 the girl in my head is constantly trying to get out of doing things - every  &apos;thing &apos; like going to work ,  going to school ,  socializing ,  etc .
 anything besides sitting at home in my chair ,  smoking a joint ,  and watching some coming-of-age drama/comedy .
 i have to force myself everyday to do all the stuff that being an adult human requires of me .
 i think almost everyone feels this way .
 that girl is depression .
 she &apos;s definitely starting to kick my ass now .
 all she wants to do is lay in bed ,  self-harm ,  and cry .
 i take my medications and persevere ,  but it &apos;s difficult .
 the guy in my head not letting me lay in bed all day smoking pot and watching cartoons .
 closes pornhub  .
 i dunno what you &apos;re talkin &apos; bout .
 that guy wants to die .
 unsure how to avoid him .
 copious amounts of caffeine seems to do okay .
 that guy for me is someone who is constantly grumpy ,  never wants to get out of pajamas ,  and loves being drunk and high .
 to avoid said guy ,  i make a conscious effort to stay productive ,  motivate myself ,  and never drink alone .
 i figure that i may as well share about my guy .
 my guy hates me ,  and what little bit of a life i &apos;ve built for myself .
 the guy in me just wants to lay in bed all day ,  every single day ,  until i age out and die .
 don &apos;t even get me started on the other thing the guy wants to do to me .
 and ,  yeah ,  it &apos;s pretty similar to bourdain &apos;s in terms of its other cravings .
 to fight back ,  i try listening to music that fits my emotions at the moment .
 i try keeping my hands busy ,  and luckily i enjoy cooking .
 deck building for magic the gathering can also help .
 i try to be creative and draw more .
 i try to exercise .
 i go out and tell jokes at open mics .
 i try to do everything that my guy doesn &apos;t want me to do .
 i want to be better than the guy that my guy wants me to be .
 he does have a grip on me most days ,  but i try my hardest to get out of it .
 holy shit anthony said that ?
 i miss him even more .
 i just wanna grill for gods sake
 he’s the voice that tells me to stop what i’m doing and end it all .
 to avoid him i just ignore what he says .
 at the moment he’s wrong .
 have to say ,  i am touched by op’s attentiveness to responses displaying distress .
 ah ,  rupaul caller her the “inner saboteur” .
 it sounds cliché but it’s so true .
 and “that guy” never really goes away ,  you just have to learn to stay one step ahead .
 tried doing push-ups .
 gave all the motivation i needed to get off my ass cause i was so pathetic
 the one that wants to to something drastic to qualify for social security disability and then ,  jobless ,  lounge around all day drinking beer ,  watching whatever ,  and roaming around gta 5 as i eat the gubment cheese .
 my guy wants to smoke weed and play guitar all day .
  it just happens to be my job and i &apos;m trying to turn it into an originals career now with a new band .
 i got tired of fighting him so i just embraced the fucker .
 i’m a microbiology major ,  premed and all but sometimes i really just want to stay at home and be a cute little housewife .
 i want to have three kids and be a pta mom !
 i love the idea but i know i couldn’t be truly happy with that .
 my guy just wants to sleep .
 all fucking day .
 oh  i am suppose to avoid him ?
 the guy doesn &apos;t believe i &apos;ll ever be happy .
 he thinks i &apos;ll ruin every relationship i &apos;m in and give up on every endeavor i do .
 my hobbies and family help me out .
 mine tells me to end it and that even all the hurt that comes with it that it &apos;s better to leave everyone and everything and start over .
 he just wants to start over .
 started selling all my stuff to appease him .
 i finally admitted this week i am depressed .
 now i have to do something about .
 poor anthony bourdain .
 my guy doesn &apos;t want to bother being alive .
 i avoid him by positive thinking ,  recognizing mental distortions ,  therapy ,  and increasingly exercise .
 i don’t avoid him .
 i hate all this climb the ladder ,  work constantly ,  ‘self-improvement’ shit .
 it’s just about making you feel bad about yourself in the hopes you will buy some shit you don’t need .
 as far as i can tell all it does is make people desperately unhappy .
 they become perfectionists and they are never good enough for themselves .
 i work hard ,  i live a quiet life ,  and you can bet your arse i will spend my free time relaxing and engaging in personally enjoyable activities .
 i don’t owe this world my ‘best self’ ,  because i’m fine as i am .
 i certainly don’t need to buy any ‘motivational material’ or other cliched shite to make myself feel better .
 i don’t need a program ,  i don’t need to pay a man to show me how to do incredibly basic gym moves ,  and i don’t need any fucking entrepreneurial seminars .
 basically fuck off and let me spend my goddamn sunday’s getting high and enjoying what little time i have on this earth .
 that guy for me is the same as his .
 sonofabitch gets nothing .
  all he wants to do is drink his life away .
  hes already had 10 years of my life ,  he doesnt get a second more !
 he wins most days but i’m trying .
 so the guy (gal) in my head is kind of a depression riddled monster .
 she tells me i &apos;m worthless ,  useless ,  will never amount to anything .
 i go to therapy once a week to learn ways to outsmart her and prove her wrong .
 i don &apos;t think it will ever stop but i &apos;m learning ways to cope .
 same thing as tony described .
 i used to tak lots of adderall to chain that mofo down .
 he &apos;s what i call the devil but really he &apos;s just depression and anxiety due to bs like existentialism .
 treat yourself well ,  even the demons .
 they &apos;re part of you too .
 true healing doesn &apos;t come from pills .
 i found that out the hard way .
 ive been recently dealing with a pretty tough breakup ,  one that i caused due to me not being mentally well .
 i decided to start going to therapy once a week and ive been pushing myself out of bed every single morning to go for a 30 min run before work and after work i hit them gym .
 im just trying to be a better person for myself and actually be happy with my life for once .
 i know things dont come over night but with progress ill reach my goal eventually .
 if i have the will ,  multiple strategies work including ,  eating properly ,  exercising ,  meditation ,  talking to friends ,  talking to family ,  keeping clear priorities of what i want to do .
 unfortunately every now and then something trips everything up and the will to out maneuver the  &apos;guy in my head &apos; isn &apos;t there .
 that guy is all the more persuasive when you feel like a (to quote kyle kinane) “stripped-bare toothless cog spinning freely and ineffectually in the working machine of society” .
 i joined the army .
 now that guy doesn &apos;t have much of a choice .
 that girl does a lot of partying and is a free bird flying but this woman &apos;s kids keep her grounded and at home .
 that guy sounds ok to me .
 i &apos;d hang out with him .
 cartoons are awesome .
 the guy in my head just wants to eat junk food ,  play videogames and jerkoff all day long .
 i only avoid him by going to work but on my days off it &apos;s a party .
 for me that girl wants to be a stay at home mom who sells mlm and drinks a psl with her jogging buddies but i work ,  cook amazing meals and hunt becuase i know i wouldnt truly be happy if i gave up the empowerment of making my own money and truly enjoying the things i want .
 i am that guy a lot of the time .
 i used to be super productive and stress out overwork .
 i think bourdain may still be alive if he would have spent more time doing nothing instead of  trying to catch the next thing all the time with strangers .
 i don &apos;t man ,  he &apos;s not so bad .
 we &apos;re having a pretty good time together right now .
 “that guy” is a little kid who wants to play outside ,  eat delicious treats ,  and hide far ,  far away from people .
 that kid still thinks if we get in trouble (and there’s no telling if or why we are) ,  someone will come and take away all the nice things in our life .
 my life is a haphazardly-sketched idea to avoid staying that kid ,  and becoming a well-rounded ,  adequately socialized adult .
 someday i might even take a risk ,  who knows .
 that other guy is an out of control alcoholic ,  one step away from total oblivion .
 i fight with my other self a lot and we &apos;ve come to a sort of agreement .
 booze twice a week and no black outs .
 otherwise ,  i lock things down and that shitty drunk doesn &apos;t get any booze at all .
 it seems to be working ok .
 eta ,  it &apos;s taken me many years to tame the beast in my mind .
 and sometimes the beast still wins and i go on a bender .
 but for the past year or so ,  i &apos;ve been able to mostly moderate and my life and my health has gotten so much better .
 i hate exercise so much .
 i know it keeps you healthy but ,  god at what cost .
 whenever i have had a gym membership i get signed up with a routine ,  but i always end up doing an hour on a treadmill until i &apos;m tired ,  then use that as an excuse to go home .
 i have no upper body strength but at least i can run for a while .
 on sunny days i slap on some jogging shoes and go to a local park that is also a bird sanctuary .
 i play biologist .
 pretending i &apos;m discovering birds in their natural habitat and monologue to myself .
 i &apos;m not out for a run ,  i &apos;m playing biologist and it &apos;s different !
 god i hate running .
 this just made me smile .
 i wake up early but dont like rushing around in the morning or even thinking about going to workout .
 i would be the same way ,  this sucks and now i have to go to the stupid gym every day !
 i wish i could just kick my guys ass long enough to at least try this until it sticks .
 and i have no intention of being stuck anymore .
 that’s what i like to hear .
 keep on keeping on my man
 what has always helped me is i was once told  &apos;you are never stuck ,  you just dont like the consequences of making a difficult choice that may make you uncomfortable .
 your never stuck .
 maybe a choice will make you less comfortable now/temporarily ,  but you are never stuck .
 you gotta fight back man .
 hes a lazy stoner he cant be that good of a fighter
 you should flip it around .
 that person is trying their hardest to get you going ,  but you are fighting back .
 are you feeling alright man ?
 goddamn ,  i miss smoking .
 6+ years smoke-free and i still crave it as much as the day i quit .
 salad ,  vape ,  and board games ?
 worse than that ben franklin quote: “a man can die at 25 and not be buried until he’s 75 .
 i think this fucked me up as much as  &apos;retirement is a monetary number ,  not an age &apos;
 it could also be the best feeling in the world ,  when you realize how screwed up you aren’t .
 carl jung said if we deny the shadow self ,  we only feed it .
 this made me think of my mother .
 she was abused as a child and repeated such onto me and my sister .
 as well as other cruel things .
 i have the backstory of a villian .
 that &apos;s who i could have been ,  who i should have been .
 i &apos;m supposed to be my mother or my sister ,  who didn &apos;t handle their abuse well .
 i &apos;m not handling it well ,  either .
 i have ptsd and memory loss ,  but i don &apos;t break the law or hurt people .
 so ,  when i see the person(s) i could have been ,  i pat myself on the back .
 wow just got punched in the face by this quote
 what &apos;s worse is that you see it in a compeltly non metaphorical sense .
 literally the same age as me ,  with the qualification i worked for but failed to complete ,  running the patreon funded buisness i once dreamed of running .
 it hurts ,  it really does .
 but he &apos;s amazing at it .
 so it &apos;s just me and my failures ,  resisting the urge to drown myself in booze and drugs ,  trying to find something to hold on to .
 the one on my desk is: .
 “we must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret .
 i &apos;ve met that person irl ,  but i developed a chronic illness previously that put my pursuit of that life on hold .
 it was like ,  this is what you could have been if you &apos;re brain didn &apos;t flake out periodically .
 time to be someone else !
 that quote is now my wallpaper .
 thanks ,  i needed that
  &apos;if only &apos; is the saddest phrase in the english language .
 if you ever decide to do it ,  just dont be fully nude .
 then you &apos;ll be arrested and have to register as a sex offender .
 you &apos;ll only go to prison if you get cau--wait ,  wrong comments section
 technically you’ll still be running away naked ,  just from a different crowd .
 no aa for me ,  but will be 2 years sober december 14th from opiates .
 longest i’ve gone since i first used over 10 years ago .
 no intentions of going back ,  but it’s definitely a fight to outwit this cousin as well .
 stay strong my friend ,  i believe in you
 i wish you strength .
 alcoholism took away something precious from me .
 i am not an alcoholic ,  but it affected me by proxy severely .
 i &apos;m doing great now ,  scars are deep but healed .
 stop by in /r/stopdrinking if you &apos;re having a tough moment and can &apos;t make it to a meeting .
 i grew up with a mother in aa .
 i can &apos;t describe how absolutely incredible my mother was and the reverence i hold for that place and all the people who make up the community of aa .
 that guys cousin chose a difficult person to mess with .
 keep on goin friend .
 my whole life is a series of stratagems to enable that guy to spend as much time in bed watching cartoons as he can without ending up homeless or unable to pay for weed .
 if you can’t beat ‘em ,  join ‘em .
 i kind of agree with this ,  and it’s helped me a lot .
 it’s not avoiding him ,  but acknowledging there are going to be times he’s going to win .
 and that’s alright .
 that’s just a part of me .
 for me ,  letting “that guy” win every once in awhile for an hour ,  a day ,  a week ,  sometimes even a month ,  just means that the “me” i wanna be ,  just needed a fucking break .
 for me ,  its all about keeping that guy in moderation ,  because i’m 100% sure that guy is what keeps me from losing my mind every once in awhile .
 bold too assume that we are not him .
 maybe  &apos;the other guy &apos; is actually the healthy ,  motivated ,  ambitious dude and we just keep him locked up in the basement of our minds .
 of course i know him ,  he’s me .
 there is an  &apos;anthony bourdain &apos; kind person inside of me who wants to be productive ,  successful and to kill me ,  but i avoid it and don &apos;t do any of those things .
 i &apos;ve got the same arrangement .
  my guy has left me with a hell of a hangover to deal with this morning .
 for me ,  we haggle on hours ,  but overall ,  we both realize we need each other .
 i went through a period of ignoring him entirely ,  but it turns out that wasn &apos;t quite healthy either .
 fair compromise as long as it stays like that i say
 i feel like the work time guy (8-5 m-f) is the fake me ,  and the nights and weekend guy (who’s a lazy pothead) is the real me .
     fake me only exists to enable the real me to live comfortably .
 if i won the lottery i’d kill fake me immediately .
 what are you doing posting to reddit when it &apos;s clearly his turn to use your body .
 this is the best summary of my daily life i have ever heard .
 you get to work by 6-6:30 am ,  and still have to work until 5 ?
 or is your commute just really long .
 of course i know him; he &apos;s me !
 i have the same guy ,  except he also loves beer and good weed .
  i used to not care but after moving out and a year spent with my own vices i am starting to seriously burn out .
  i would say everyone needs a time to indulge to the point they cant handle it anymore .
  now i drink less then i have since i can remember and work out more then i ever had .
 are you doing okay ?
 precisely ,  you &apos;ve said it very well .
 for me at least ,  getting high just made me very content with doing absolutely nothing .
 which is fine sometimes ,  but i was high all the time and then doing nothing ,  all the time .
 i was so bored and boring to myself that i had to quit smoking and other drugs completely .
 it &apos;s only been a few years .
 it still feels like a work in progress but i &apos;m getting happier with who i am
 when i &apos;m not smoking weed ,  it is highly motivating .
 1) because i have to do things to stop the cravings ,  and 2) because when i &apos;m not high i often go to cool places and think ,   &apos;man ,  this would be better if i was high !
  &apos; sadly that &apos;s motivation towards the dark side .
 i miss pot ,  but i don &apos;t miss those times in general .
 i can be like this with alcohol sometimes .
  like you ,  it was playing too large a role in my life .
  reducing the frequency didn &apos;t work out so i just stopped all together .
  there are still plenty of days (especially after being outside in the heat) where i &apos;d love to come home and have a beer .
  but at my age ,  and with anxiety issues to begin with ,  even just a couple of beers would make me feel like crap the next day .
  i don &apos;t miss that at all and i &apos;m a much happier person in general without it .
 i have always tended toward anxiety and panic attacks rather than depression but i do understand what you describe here .
 the real me wants to make a huge buffet ,  host a fancy dress party for all my friends and then write that drama i &apos;ve got an idea for but anxiety can just punch me in the stomach and pin me down and yell at me to stop it ,  to stop doing anything because i &apos;m ugly ,  deformed ,  stupid and unoriginal and nobody will hang out with me anyway and i have to hide under the duvet shaking until i can function again .
 as much as i dislike my dad ,  he told me about his brothers suicide when they were young .
 he did the car thing and a hose ,  yada yada .
 it &apos;s almost like i &apos;m coded not to commit suicide today ,  and yet ,  when i experienced my mom dying of cancer 3 years ago i found it incredible cruel to let someone experience this much pain in the face of certain death .
 so yeah ,  i &apos;m not against suicide ,  the reason has to be just ,  but not illogical .
 it &apos;s funny what keeps us going .
 i &apos;d say it &apos;s various dog videos that does it for me ,  it &apos;s the only time i really feel anymore .
 reddit is honestly the only remaining place on the internet where i can find people talking seriously about mental health without the damn site trying to force me onto the hotline .
 thanks for sharing .
 you &apos;ve really described a lot of what i feel too .
 i &apos;ve been depressed since i was literally 9 years old (so ,  12 years now .
 over half my life) because of chemical shit in my brain .
 meds arent really touching my depression .
 whenever my doses are upped i get a high for a few days (which i &apos;m now very aware of because i &apos;m experienced it a few times now) and then go right back down into suicidal depression .
 the only thing i know for sure is i have severe ptsd and depression ,  which is being treated but in the i think 6 months i &apos;ve been on all kinds of different meds and therapy once a week i havent seen a difference and it really just makes me feel even more broken than before .
 i assume you’ve tried almost every ssri and snri under the sun at this point .
 have you heard about ketamine being used to treat depression ?
 it’s the first new breakthrough in antidepressiant medications in 50 years by its method of action .
 whole different class of drugs ,  not just another ssri or snri .
 it has shed a light on my life that hasn’t been there for a long time .
 i’ll gladly type up more info and provide links with excerpts if you’d be interested in learning more .
 have you read “lincoln’s melancholy” by joshua shenk ?
 it changed my perspective on my own depression .
 sort of accepting that it’s a part of me .
 that even if i take the drugs and do the therapy ,  it will be there in background cause it always has been .
 what i read and understood about lincoln in that book has more than once shifted my focus in darker times .
 it’s really hard to describe it ,  but i highly recommend it .
 good luck friend .
 i wish you the best .
 this got me through college .
 i just went in in the morning and never ever came home until my work was done (late afternoon/early evening mostly) .
 being stuck on campus all day even if i wasn &apos;t super productive the work would get done because what else is there to do ?
 basically the plan was to dick off so much that doing my actual work was a welcome change of pace .
 at home i can dick off indefinitely without getting tired of it; and better yet i didn &apos;t have to feel too bad about dicking off at home because i never had any (school) work to do there .
 yeah i just stay at the school if i think i’ll come home and fuck off
 sounds exactly like me in college .
 pro tip: don &apos;t get a job where you work from home .
 adhd here as well .
  plus bipolar for even more fun times .
  i &apos;m one semester short of a mechanical engineering degree ,  but early last year (before i knew about the bipolar) i was prescribed lexapro and  &apos;that guy &apos; took full control .
  walked out on the internship i &apos;d worked at for a year and a half (with a full-time job waiting post-graduation) ,  started smoking weed like a fiend ,  ended up on a year of probation for an eighth ,  dropped out ,  moved back home ,  got fired from several jobs ,   and lost the woman i &apos;d been with for 10 years and had planned to marry after graduation .
  my emotions were so out of control that i kept contacting her for a couple months until she blocked me on everything .
  my libido skyrocketed and my dick stopped working ,  pushing me into many reckless sexual encounters .
  i was emotionally abusive to everyone around me .
 i was a fucking scumbag .
 that ssri caused me to do ,  say ,  and think things that were so far out of character i didn &apos;t recognize myself .
  it amplified my impulsiveness ,  caused full-fledged manic episodes ,  and made me suicidal when i &apos;d never felt that way before .
  therapy did nothing to reign me in .
  i finally stopped taking it in may of this year and switched to wellbutrin and lamotrigine .
  within days of stopping lexapro i could feel my head turning back around .
  within a month the voice that had gotten me so far in school was starting to whisper in the back of my head ,  and the whisper has been growing stronger since .
  i &apos;m still trying to recover from the emotional havoc i caused for the people around me .
  got a new therapist who &apos;s been fantastic for me ,  and i &apos;m starting an engineering-adjacent job on monday .
  i &apos;m hoping to return to school next fall .
  once i &apos;m settled into the new job ,  my therapist has agreed to help me reach out to my ex-fiance ,  but i &apos;m fairly certain that the damage i did was permanent .
 this isn &apos;t really related to your post other than the adhd ,  but i &apos;m on the tail end of the worst two years of my life and needed to vent .
  be careful combining psychotropics .
 this made me wonder if anthony had adhd as well .
 he had the classic dichotomous personality where he &apos;d either fuck off into oblivion and do nothing with himself if left to his own devices ,  or be an absurdly driven ,  focused person if thrown into something he loved .
 likewise ,  i have to shape life and limit potential decisions properly for future me or present me will be constantly suffering for it and caving into impulsiveness .
 it probably sounds nuts but if i even eat breakfast ,  it can be a slippery slope into a whole day of fuck around .
 i work a lot better on empty somehow .
 if i don &apos;t maintain a _worky_ context from the get-go or jump into things as soon as i feel the urge ,  i &apos;m liable to accomplish approximately fuck-all .
 adhd is such a drag that way .
 sometimes i think i should try meds .
 most of the time i feel like i just need to get better at setting future me up for success .
 i can never tell if i &apos;m on the precipice of catastrophe or doing _okay_ .
 my stress levels never seem to be a proper indicator .
 i definitely feel like the former most of the time .
 i have no idea how i keep going .
 fellow adhd person here ,  and jesus christ ,  it’s hard .
 the attention deficit is bad enough on its own ,  but all the other symptoms add up and even in an empty room with just a pen and paper i still can’t do it unless it’s interesting to me .
 i’ve used the isolation method ,  the reward method ,  everything they could teach me in therapy .
 i’ve yet to go on medication for it because even though i have the diagnosis ,  doctors are hesitant to prescribe women anything for managing this shit
 this is the best self-care strategy i &apos;ve ever heard of
 i did something similar when my daughter was born crazy early and sick .
 she lived for 11 months and spent the whole time in the hospital .
 when my wife went in for her c-section i wasn &apos;t allowed due to it being full sedation or some nonsense .
 i just sat by myself in the presurgery room waiting like an idiot not sure what to do .
 so i imagined old school 1990 &apos;s wolverine sitting there with me just for the company .
 i remember asking him/myself what the hell i was going to do ?
 you know that angry scared state you get into .
 i remember what logan/i told myself .
  &apos;there isn &apos;t anything easy about this .
 you are just going yo have to stand strong the way i showed you .
 and you ain &apos;t alone bub &apos; .
 phew ok i &apos;m crying right now typing this from just the memory .
 funny how things get to you .
 still i hope he would be proud of me as i never ran away or quit or anything and did my best .
 probably sounds kind of stupid but it helped for whatever its worth .
 thank you for the gold and silver .
 cool little tokens
 this is possibly the best take on mindfulness i &apos;ve ever read -- the idea of space between emotion or stimulus and action being filled with mr spock .
 this is brilliant ,  i &apos;m taking it .
 things all over the internet lately convincing me i need to go watch star trek .
 damn tribalism had me stuck on star wars or bust all these years
 funny and effective .
 you can do it ,  my dude(tte) .
 me: thi-this is ridiculous this can &apos;t actually work can i-- .
 spock:  &apos;on the contrary sir ,  data suggests condensing your consciousness to a singular entity can help channel and focus solutions to day to day frustrations and increase morale by 82 .
 me: well would ya look at that ?
 iiiiii am stealing this .
 i want to fire the dude in my head and replace him with a mini-spock too .
 my dude is an idiot .
 my dude: oh no decision time ?
 oh shit oh shit oh shit uh i dunno let &apos;s just binge watch old hell &apos;s kitchen episodes instead and feel bad about it later .
 oh my god ,  the guy in my head is spock too !
 i can &apos;t believe someone else does the same thing .
 when i was a freshman in high school ,  i was having a lot of difficulty managing anger and other intense emotions .
 then i went to go see star trek 2009 in theaters ,  and spock &apos;s father said this line that stuck with me ever since:  &apos;emotions run deep within our race .
 in many ways more deeply than in humans .
 logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience .
 the control of feelings so that they do not control you .
  &apos; the movie showed young spock &apos;s struggle with his human emotions ,  but obviously he overall manages it in a way that leaves him logical .
 ever since then ,  whenever i felt like i was getting overwhelmed with emotion ,  i would imagine two things: 1) i &apos;m a vulcan (lol i know this is lame ,  but it gives me a reason for why i &apos;m feeling the emotion so strongly) 2) a little mr .
 spock in my head telling me  &apos;do not be controlled by your feelings .
 you are a vulcan .
 logic is the path .
 real neat that we both use spock for our mental health :)
 real spock:  &apos;fascinating &apos;
 i don &apos;t know how to be spock but this sounds useful as fuck .
 i have more of a large dad figure in my head that picks up the brain goblins as they try to run amok .
 he &apos;s practical ,  and rather caring so he makes dealing with my mental illnesses easier .
 i named him broden for some reason .
 viceddistraction: this is so clever !
 i wish i thought of it .
 i should have thought of it .
 spock: despite when and how a solution enters the mind ,  application is the critical phase .
 the probability of recognizing a solution for personal growth is typically quite low .
 viceddistraction: thanks for the feedback ,  spock .
 your perspective is just what i think i’ll need from now on .
 spock: past behavior predicts this thought will be forgotten about in 7-8 minutes after full execution of this post’s completion .
  &apos;thank you ,  spock .
  &apos;for what ,  captain ?
 i was merely making an observation .
 i really really need to quit (but for real this time) .
 i think i might invite spock to take up residence in my head as well .
 thanks for the bit of brilliance .
 i’d really like to live long enough to see all my kids get married !
 you rock for every single hour you go without smoking !
 i do this too but the voice in my head is amy from brooklyn nine nine .
 in acceptance there is peace .
 i love this answer .
 my “that girl” is anxiety .
 i try to love her ,  and work out ,  and meditate ,  and eat well ,  and go to therapy ,  and cuddle with my dogs ,  and be honest about how i feel .
 she loves me and wants to protect me ,  but i can’t let her run my entire life .
 what is this celeste
 girl ,  i feel ya .
 i used to be someone who could spend entire summers between school lying in bed watching some series or another .
 i miss the freedom i had as a student but not the laziness .
 i also miss how much more social i was then .
 now i have to argue with the girl that just wants to stay in and cancel on her friends .
 sometimes i really hatefully do it ,  but find myself having so much fun when i’m socialising .
 sometimes this is what i tell my girl ,  that i always end up having fun .
 inner demons can be so draining sometimes
 definitely ,  i feel the same way but my thing is video games .
 like sometimes i don &apos;t even want to play the game and i &apos;d rather be doing the constructive thing but i still don &apos;t ,  because it &apos;s  &apos;work &apos; .
 it makes no sense .
 cut out the  &apos;coming-of-age &apos; and replace it with youtube or anime ,  that &apos;s sorta what my guy wants .
 among other things .
 yup that &apos;s mine exactly .
 medications haven &apos;t had any effect on me and i &apos;m not too sure what else to try .
 i haven &apos;t self harmed in months but i &apos;m very tempted to .
 i &apos;ve been trying but it &apos;s definitely an uphill battle .
 man i love hozier so it was a pleasant shock to see his name after that quote .
 don &apos;t you ever tame your demons   .
 but always keep  &apos;em on a leash .
 -  &apos;arsonist &apos;s  .
 maybe some people _should_ tame their demons .
 i love hozier songs
 better hope the guy in your head doesn &apos;t get into pot .
 then he too will become the guy in your head not letting you lay in bed all day smoking pot and watching cartoons .
 hope everything is going ok man ,  it &apos;s ok if its not .
 pm if you want to ,  i &apos;m no stranger to that sorta feeling .
 but we are both commenting here ,  so we certainly haven &apos;t lost yet .
  drinking unleashes him .
  meds keep him at bay .
 that guy wants to die but do you want too ?
 give that guy some help and tell him it &apos;s ok because he has you by his side
 i hope you are enjoying those experiences .
 it seems like you have the upper hand .
 you’re doing things a lot of people would never ,  like at open mics .
 luckily ,  there’s millions of sweet shit you can do in this life !
 you can tell that guy you’ve got shit to do !
 and gtfo of your way !
 i miss his voice .
 feed your demons ,  feed them ribs !
 i really only thought that this wouldn &apos;t get anymore than like 10 actual replies .
 literally not even 3 hours later i have thousands of likes and comments .
 but ,  nevertheless ,  i am still reading(or trying to read) ,  upvoting ,  and replying to every comment that i can .
 good news is that if i haven &apos;t already reached out and asked how someone &apos;s feeling ,  most of the time other people already have .
 the internet is a beautiful thing sometimes .
 got to eat to live   .
 got to work to eat   .
 otherwise ,  we’d get along !
 i call him “gollum” and holding a plank for a minute usually gives me an edge on him
 if you think about it if you can only do like 1 push-up ,  that &apos;s maximum effort ,  so that one push-up (or whatever exercise) is at it &apos;s most efficient for gains ,  by thinking this way doing the hardest thing is actually the most efficient and thus lazy ,  and great for you
 just remind that inner guy that disability is actually pretty hard to get !
 i have 3 separate ,  major diseases one of which gives me several weekly seizures ,  and was told no .
  i just had an appeal hearing last month ,  after waiting 2 years for it .
 thought he fooled the system .
 substituted fentayl for the beer though .
 he &apos;s no longer with us .
 keeping busy keeps some people out of trouble .
 tomorrow ,  maybe watch one of your brother’s favorite movies !
 or find a movie that he might have liked ,  and watch it in his honor .
 you can do it ,  i believe in you !
 i &apos;m a current law student (2l) and don &apos;t want anything more than to meet a lady lawyer who wants me to be a stay at home dad .
 i also know it would get old fast but hey .
 day dreaming never hurts .
 you are not alone .
 i’m not the one to tell you that listening to that guy will be the wrong decision; to be honest i don’t know .
 but do know that every life is worth something .
 you are worth something .
 and this world will be different without you 3
 that &apos;s right ,  i mean look at animals for instance .
 all they do is lay around and chill until they get hungry .
 we conditioned ourselves to be unhappy unless we do something ,  like ,  we are constantly trying to one up ourselves ,  only to end up in the same place we were before .
 it &apos;s this constant seeking for some imaginary goal and some imaginary future that never comes ,  that make us anxious and unhappy .
 it &apos;s like running around in a circle
 i totally feel this .
 sometimes i see the stay at home moms hanging out in their athleisure at the panera near my house and i envy their relative freedom .
 but i know ultimately it would be a bad life choice for me .
 please don &apos;t do the mlm thing !
  the rest is totally up to you .
 bourdain was ,  or became ,  an incredible workaholic .
 i think he spent so many years as an addict and burnout that  when he had a chance to achieve his dreams (and honestly ,  probably far exceed his dreams) he couldn &apos;t say no to anything and felt compelled to do more and more .
 but i could be wrong ,  i &apos;m no shrink .
 if that works for you ,  great !
 if not ,  have you considered something else ,  like rock climbing ,  playing a sport ,  or lifting weights ?
 i loathe running too ,  especially on treadmills .
 thankfully ,  exercise doesn &apos;t need to be running .
 like a bird that flew
 it helps to think about how easy this will make your life .
 how calls from work opportunities will come faster ,  how your salary will improve and you &apos;ll make it to the end of the month now .
 also ,  think about all the time you waste all day that can be used studying .
 you won &apos;t remember most years anyway ,  how many nights of homework do you even remember ?
 it won &apos;t matter anyways ,  might as well do something with that time to ensure a better future .
 this was somehow insanely philosophical to me
 oh he is much stronger .
 he has a cause .
 someone’s never met a 10th planet student
 that person is trying their hardest to get me going ,  but i &apos;m a loser .
 that puts us in a frame of being in control .
  you can then just change whatever you want easily ,  because it &apos;s you rather than someone or something else .
  i just tried it and it works .
  this is exactly what i came here for .
 i &apos;m alright man ,  thanks for asking .
 just need to figure out how to overcome laziness that &apos;s all .
 same for me ,  just over 6 years and i could go back to a pack a day tomorrow if i was lazy .
 had my last cigarette and never cheated once as it would be a pack a day again instantly .
 the worst are the dreams where i am smoking and i wake up in a panic .
 and you might still miss it when you’re 90 .
  but at least you’ll be alive to miss it with everyone you love with you too  sendin good vibes
 man ,  funeral companies were hella inefficient back then
 given the outcome of mr bourdain we could argue that a balance must be struck .
 which brings up my next favorite franklin quote: .
 “moderation in all things - including moderation .
 not really in the spirit of the thread but “money doesn’t buy happiness ,  it buys freedom” has always bothered me .
 it’s true & if you think about it it’s seriously fucked on multiple levels .
 yeah my college professor used to say he was retired ,  when people stated how he was teaching .
  he said retirement is when you stop working for the sake of money and survival but doing it because you loved what you do .
  he also owned a few businesses so that may have helped 
 nah i hate that .
 i was about that life for a minute until it took hold of me like a disease and i was making myself absolutely miserable for no good reason .
 should you fuck over your future to go full yolo on the present ?
 save generously for retirement .
 keep an emergency fund .
 safeguard your future .
 but don’t fuck up your present for a future that’s not guaranteed either .
 that’s just as bad a world view as the other way around ,  sacrificing part of your life for the sake of another part .
 but for some reason a lot of the financial subreddits love to advocate for it .
 i’ve got extended family like this .
 saved all their life and now .
 they just spend it st the casino and dumping cash in the collection plate at church ,  because they’re too broken down to actually do anything with the money (be it self enrichment stuff or do charity work or whatever) .
 another one i’m reminded of is a guy who posted on /r/cars .
 he spent his whole life wanting a sportscar ,  and told himself he’d get it when he retired .
 guy finally retires ,  bus a 100k+ porsche 911 s .
 and sells it a year later because it hurts too much to get in and out of ,  and it hurt his back to drive it (and porsche’s are some of the nicest/most gentle ,  most easy to live with sports cars out there) .
 should he have bought the 100k car in his 30s ?
 no ,  but he could have probably found something fun and cheap to enjoy along the way .
 bear in mind this quote doesn &apos;t just apply to financial success .
  it could mean any goal .
  perhaps you wanted to own your own restauran for examplet .
  its a challenging goal but for most people ,  realistic ,  with enough effort (successful is another matter though) .
  imagine you &apos;d always wanted to own a restaurant but never did ,  the worst feeling must be meeting people that have done it ,  people that could have been you .
 thats a fair point but i &apos;ve always tried to use it as a sign of motivation
 could someone unpack this for me ?
 it doesn &apos;t hit me and seems to impact others .
 some regard their ideal self with shy humility and would like to deny it: they fear their higher self because ,  when it speaks ,  it speaks demandingly .
 i grew up with two narcissistic adults and one who was completely codependent (read: negligent) .
 i have spent over 12 years in therapy dealing with ptsd from their abuse and negligence .
 you know what keeps me going ?
 my therapist telling me i am the last stop .
 i am where the abuse ends .
 i am my family’s “agent of change” .
 looking back at my family history ,  there is generation after generation of abuse .
 that was always the case — until me .
 up until people like us were born ,  no one in our family was strong enough to change .
 no one had the power or the courage to withstand the abuse and not become it .
 so yes ,  you should definitely pat yourself on the back ,  and know that even on your worst day you are still not them .
 you’re a fighter .
 you are the last stop .
 the abuse stops with you .
 you get to take what was meant to harm you and destroy you and completely alter the course of your family line .
 sending you massive hugs of encouragement .
 i did not expect this comment would even really be seen ,  so thank you internet friend for my first gold and thank you to everyone in the thread below for the kind comments !
 to use a really cliche quote:  &apos;be kind ,  for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle &apos; .
 find opportunities to show kindness to others ,  but make sure you also find opportunities to show kindness to yourself .
 (also fixed some spelling mistakes)
 maybe one day you can help others to achieve what you did .
 yeah i think its good advice for anyone ,  i just wish i was better at taking it
 the quote still applies to where you could be 10 years from now .
 the rock got denied his dream of being in the nfl and now look at him .
 as long as you &apos;re still alive there &apos;s a chance you can find other dreams to bring to life .
 put your chin up and go at it again .
 noted ,  i’ll wear socks
 yes officer this one right here
 you and the poster above you are both amazing ,  keep it up
 going through wds at this moment .
 that guy in my head is screaming at me but i’ve been putting up barriers for him and hoping to tough this out and be done for good .
 thanks for sharing that you’re on the other side .
 december 14th is my birthday .
 i lost half of my family due to opiate addiction .
 i’ll be sober from alcohol for 3 months in 5 days .
 is there such a thing as mary jane aa meetings ?
 i &apos;ve never gotten more replies to a simple comment .
 gotcha there &apos;s ma and r/leaves
 a lot of years ,  and as many people .
 that abbreviation gave me the impression that whelsh is just a language consisting of really long abbreviations .
 yay this makes me happy too !
 i’ve been sober since 2006 as a young person so my kids have only known sober me but i’d like to think the principles have made me a better mom .
 although i still mess up a lot ,  i’d be a much worse mom if i was drinking .
 this gives me hope as a mother in aa/na .
 thank you for this .
 excuse me but i am you .
  &apos;hey ,  how do you like your job ?
  &apos;i don &apos;t but it gives me money to get pretty fucked up on the regular and see crazy shit .
 so that &apos;s cool .
 i just beat him off
 is this black mirror ?
 i swear i &apos;ve seen this situation before .
 sometimes the other guy does things like clean the entire kitchen ,  or leave a glass of water by the bed ,  and that &apos;s pretty cool .
 i had an ok officer in the navy tell the people that worked for him (paraphrasing) “i think of myself as three people: past me ,  present me ,  and future me .
  past-me laid the groundwork for present-me .
 sometimes i think he was an asshole ,  other times i thank him .
 i try to do my best for future-me ,  knowing that’s who i’ll become .
 a super-salty senior chief said ,  loud enough for me to hear ,  “three guys are fucking his wife .
 biting ones tongue hard enough to draw blood is an effective strategy to keep from laughing .
 i &apos;ve been trying to negotiate some extra time in the evenings for working out and/or hobbies ,  but he says it will cut into his 4 hour gaming sessions .
 you &apos;ve all given really good advice .
 i think we &apos;re close to reaching an agreement .
 i identify with this as well .
 i feel like everything about my work persona is fake .
 i think my job is stupid an unimportant ,  i think most of my coworkers are beneath me intellectually (not trying to be a dick ,  but they have mostly proven to be stupid an unreliable) ,  and the management are disconnected as fuck .
 yet i win employee awards ,  am highly regarded by my coworkers ,  and have to just smile along the whole way .
 to be quite frank with myself ,  i am just being a complete and total insincere bullshitter with myself .
 my coworkers might not know it ,  but i do ,  and that’s what counts .
 my waiting room has wifi
 get home at like 5 .
 i &apos;d also like to recommend (in general and when the feeling of needing that vice kicks in) just sitting or lying down and just focusing on your breathing .
 let all your thoughts and feelings happen around it but let your focus be breathing in and out .
 i think most people would be surprised how much it helps .
 for me it &apos;s like i need those vices to distract me or make me feel good or even just as something to do cause i feel bored .
 but lately i &apos;ve been just simply practicing breathing and i &apos;ve realized how much those vices were just serving to compact those feelings tighter into me instead of lifting them off me .
 just letting me brain even attempt to return to a state of calm has let other thoughts become much more prevalent than just serving the part of my mind that wants enjoyment .
 i guess i &apos;m just describing meditation but when you say meditation some people take it as this complex practice of yoga and mantras n stuff but i just want to promote the importance of rhythmic breathing .
 i work from home as well so it’s very easy to just sit around and never leave the house .
 i’m finally starting to realize how bad this is for me ,  but it’s difficult to fix .
 i do go to the gym at least twice a week ,  and i have some hobbies and friends that get me out of the house occasionally but .
 it’s lonely ,  honestly .
 and i’m getting burnt out on my hobbies .
 yeah i &apos;m fine ,  i just use reddit too much lol
 i like randy marsh’s quote about it from south park .
 “well ,  stan ,  the truth is marijuana probably isn &apos;t gonna make you kill people ,  and it most likely isn &apos;t gonna fund terrorism ,  but… well ,  son ,  pot makes you feel fine with being bored .
 and it &apos;s when you &apos;re bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative .
 if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren &apos;t good at anything .
 good for you ,  man .
 all of life is a work in progress .
 in the end the work is what fulfills it ,  i find .
 i feel very differently about pot now than what i used to feel during my younger smoking days .
 over the years i &apos;ve realized that pot used to make me procrastinate when i smoked all day erry day ,  but now i &apos;ve gained the sacred knowledge which is  &apos;one joint a day keeps the doctor away &apos; .
 it only works when i &apos;m done with all my responsibilities for the day and have nothing else left to do than smoking ,  eating and sleeping .
 it sort of feels like mindful meditation when i do this everyday ,  and i actually prefer to do it alone rather than with friends .
 it kinda gives me time to reflect ,  process and make new plans about everything happening in my life .
 i &apos;d have killed myself if it wasn &apos;t for weed tbh .
 it &apos;s horrible how our own mind can play these cruel games with us .
 i always remind myself that it really doesn &apos;t matter .
 in the end everyone dies ,  and in the end end the solar system will blow up and the memory of us will be gone .
 who cares if today i make a mistake and people see it .
 we all try and fail .
 we also try and succeed .
 i have a tattoo that says  &apos;focus on the positive &apos; ,  that &apos;s what i try to do as much as possible .
 yo ,  fellow anxious person .
 i used to have this pretty bad sometimes ,  along with panic attacks that made me think i was going schizophrenic or something .
 you know ,  not really but that’s what my mind kept going to .
 what really helped me was treating that anxiety like a friend in my head ,  but a really shitty one that i was fed up of listening to and just objectively telling my anxiety that it wasn’t helping with what i was trying to achieve and it should come back later .
 it sounds dumb but over a period of time it seemed like i just subconsciously got fed up with this shit person trying to barge into my life and it got easier to tell them to fuck off .
 anyway ,  that may not be useful to you in the slightest but i hope it gets better for you .
 i don’t have a problem getting assignments in on time ,  but i do most assignments on the day they are due ,  or the day before .
 it has worked so far ,  and my grades aren’t bad at all .
 however ,  i should probably be getting shit done sooner .
 i should start doing this .
 i really only wanted to comment this so i can put this commitment into words .
 i used to stay in my lab ,  sometimes overnight (on the sofa outside) ,  to combat my urges .
 likewise i had a retail job where i had a little down time .
 i spent that downtime studying and doing homework .
 i too have adhd ,  and while i &apos;m not on stimulants anymore ,  a good night &apos;s sleep and a can do attitude really do help .
 this got me through college .
 this got me through the beginning of my career .
 i still struggle hard with it and don &apos;t have the ability to sink days into work ,  but i have accomplishments under my belt now so i can trick people into thinking i &apos;m not an adhd black hole of idiocy .
 i have this problem ,  it’s procrastination .
 problem is the phone in my hand .
 it’s tailored to all the fun things i like to do ,  reddit ,  games ,  small doses of social media .
 and as soon as i’m in a place of being unsure i whip out my phone ,  lose an hour .
 shit still need to do that homework .
 still not sure what i should do .
 i work from home two to three days a week and while it can be conductive to laziness ,  i &apos;ll go to the local coffee shop to make sure i &apos;m engaged .
 also ,  knowing that if i do great there &apos;s serious room for upward movement .
 i understand not all jobs are like that ,  though .
 people love to say they’d love to work from home ,  but i’m so lazy and insular now .
 even moving around the house seems like a lot of work .
 the feeling of getting into comfy clothes after a long day of work isn’t the same if that’s all you wear each day .
 i &apos;ve never been officially diagnosed with add ,  i &apos;ve never been hyperactive but my teachers suspected it when i was younger because i had a hard time focusing and god forbid i get bored ,  there was no way to get me back .
 i always doubted it was true but reading this thread made me think i might have add ,  i always wrote it off as depression .
 in the last 5 years ,  i &apos;ve had 7 jobs and been to 3 different schools in 4 different programs .
 i &apos;ve dropped out like 5 times and i honestly feel hopeless .
 i often become lazy and as much as it stresses me the fuck out i have such a hard time getting back on my feet every time .
 i &apos;m maybe ranting right now but these posts made me realize i probably need help or something bad might happen to me .
 can &apos;t help it but adapt it to the madagascar penguins .
  &apos;looking at the bug bump forming under his pants ,  it seems like mtlredditor is going through a period of extreme horniness preventing him from concentrating on work ,  sir !
  &apos;looks like we have a situation to fix guys !
 get us something useful !
  &apos;a mental image of his mom having sex !
 get dressed into a hairy fat lady with a moustache !
 the bump is going away !
 looks like a job well done guys !
 seriously i am going to actively try and use this .
 i usually read this kind of stuff and think “that’s cool i’ll try it” and file it away .
 but this one seems like something that would really really help .
 he would be very proud of you .
 i’m very proud of you .
    be proud of yourself ,  you’re the real logan .
 i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
 that does not sound stupid !
 in fact ,  it sounds like a great idea for self care !
 logan can regenerate from pretty much any physical catastrophe .
 it looks like you are the complement ,  regenerating a tremendous amount from an emotional devastation .
 i think he would be proud .
 that sounds like an unbelievably scary and vulnerable time ,  so thank you for sharing .
 you had absolutely no power in that situation ,  yet everything you held dear was on the line .
 you heard wisdom then ,  telling you that the only course of action was to hang tough and be present in the moment  ,  and you listened .
 that takes serious guts .
 as does telling that story .
 there’s nothing more you could have done .
 there’s no blame to be placed .
 you did what you could ,  and that was right .
 thank you again .
 there is so much pain ,  shared humanity ,  and kindness here right now ,  and i &apos;m grateful for that .
 but i am  so sorry for your loss 3
 after all ,  you can &apos;t truly hate star trek until you &apos;re a fan !
 i &apos;m a star wars super nerd ,  it consumes me .
 my wife introduced me to star trek since i wasn &apos;t interested as a kid and i &apos;ve loved it immediately .
 like every series and all the movies too .
 star wars and star trek really don &apos;t compete ,  completely different things .
 this was me all of my childhood .
 started watching a few years ago and it’s been such a fun journey .
 i’m now a much bigger fan of trek but star wars still holds a special place in my heart .
 thank you so much for this comment .
 i &apos;ve been working to see my anxiety as something that used to be necessary given the setting i was living in & while that helps ,  i still have this frustration with myself for avoiding everything and being so nervous .
 personifying those tendencies as a separate protective person seems like a great way to be more gentle with that aspect of me .
 thanks so much for reframing this 
 jackie and wilson touches my soul
 there are plenty of good ways to indulge your inner arsonist .
 for example: every single person involved with burning man’s fire operation .
 those people are highly trained safety professionals who love to set big shit on fire .
 he knew that at himself ,  which shows incredible insight .
 he also killed himself ,  showing that knowing oneself isn &apos;t the end solution to fixing yourself .
 jfc our government systems are total and utter shit .
 it’s shameful that you were denied .
 well ,  more reason to avoid my version of that guy !
 we could sing a duet of i &apos;m proud to be an american before we maim ourselves !
 i’m also a 2l and stay-at-home dad is the dream job
 i agree completely .
 as long as you’re not hurting others why does it matter so much ?
 you know ,  health is important and you can’t just neglect things entirely ,  but we don’t need to make life this hard for ourselves .
 i’ll never be a millionaire ,  i won’t ever have pecs to rival arnie’s or a pecker to rival lexington steele ,  and that’s fine .
 i like myself ,  so it’s okay .
 i don’t think most people have ‘dreams’ ,  or really that much in the way of ambition .
 normal everyday folks just like to be with their loved ones ,  engage in a couple of hobbies and enjoy their free time .
 if you can find a job that pays enough and doesn’t make you want to off yourself ,  all the better .
 we live such sweet blessed lives and when i look around me all i see are unhappy faces ,  it’s so fucked up .
 it’s like we’ve declared war on normal people living normal lives ,  it’s not good for our society .
 as you say people spend their lives running after something that will never come ,  and then ,  shit ,  too late .
 it’s one of the biggest deathbed regrets .
 to have not simply stopped and smelled the roses .
 i &apos;m of the same opinion .
  &apos;bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows was a strain &apos; - yeah no fuckin shit lol .
 if i &apos;m not home/with family for more than a day it &apos;s like  &apos;ok i miss my family &apos; .
 if i took a job like that my so would leave me lol
 the problem is that running is probably the most easily accessible of any cardiovascular workout .
 a good pair of shoes and some spf and youre good to go .
 ya know i just had this same revelation pretty recently ,  and it brings me a kind of satisfaction to see it shared on here .
 whenever i feel myself struggling to maintain focus on a goal ,  i have to remind myself that id rather be struggling in pursuit of that goal- instead of being miserable because i &apos;ve given up on trying to do anything  at all ,  and as a result of giving up i would feel much farther removed from some scenario where i can feel any real satisfaction or happiness found in achieving said goal .
 oof that was one hell of a wordy run-on sentence .
 if the stoned guy inside of me fights like eddie bravo ,  then i’m fucked .
 well no ,  you &apos;re a winner .
 it &apos;s just that you &apos;re winning the wrong fight .
 it is the worst .
 my best advice is to start small .
 do a bit more each day .
 before you know it you &apos;ll be kicking his ass .
 everyday ur not livin ur dyin my guy ,  i smoke pot like anthonys head says to ,  but i make sure to spend it w the most seratonin dumping activities that are also brain stimulating ,  hiking ,  shroom hunting ,  math homework ,  writing ,  drawing etc
 you ever had preworkout ?
 i quit for two years ,  reached a stressful point in life (two kids within a year of each other was wreaking havoc on my mental health and my relationship) and bought a pack intending to just have one or two to distract me from a spectacularly bad day .
 i was right back to a pack a day and now i have to quit all over again .
 ) ,  i feel you ,  but just remember that the first nail back hits harder than the next 19 ,  it &apos;s almost convenient that you feel like shit after smoking a cig like you did before 6 years of no smoking .
 the next one isn &apos;t so bad ,  though ,  i recommend not getting that far .
 i get the exact same dreams ,  but for heroin .
 dopamine man ,  it &apos;s crazy how much control it put over your actions and even your dreams .
 thankfully i don &apos;t get them very often anymore ,  but when i do i feel like i &apos;m a jonesing when i wake up .
 if i &apos;m alive at 90 ,  i &apos;m definitely gonna start smoking again .
 had those funeral directors been the funeral directors they could have been ,  i bet folks could’ve been buried much quicker .
 i didn &apos;t see the above-mentioned quote in there ?
 also  &apos;he that lives on hope dies farting &apos; is a hilarious mistype lol
 damnit ,  i usually try to be meticulous about accurate citations but i saw the thread was new and wanted to hop on the karma train .
  &apos;money doesn &apos;t buy you happiness ,   but being broke doesn &apos;t buy you shit .
 gill landry said  &apos;you either have to be rich or have nothing at all to just hit the road as a musician &apos; stuck with me
 living the dream .
  really: you have to do something .
  teaching a college course and not having to live off of what they would pay you is awesome .
 he said retirement is when you stop working for the sake of money and survival but doing it because you loved what you do .
 which i hasten to add doesn &apos;t mean ,   &apos;i like the work i do to survive .
 instead ,  it genuinely means you could stop working and live at a similar quality of life .
 i feel the same way man .
 like i could get through school quicker ,  take more classes ,  save some money ,  and that would probably be the most “driven” thing to do ,  but i also want to have a life in my early 20s and not spend my entire waking life studying and working .
 why should i do that ?
 i make enough money to squeeze by right now and buy some games occasionally ,  and i’m happy with my work life balance .
 i don’t want to be unhappy because it’s what i’m “supposed” to do .
 you could wake up one day after sacrificing your present self and boom ,  get diagnosed with terminal cancer ,  als ,  some incurable disease ,  you could die from a freak brain hemorrhage - who the fuck knows .
 if anything ,  making that bet ,  that you’re going to be alive for that time when you can actually use the money you’re sacrificing your life for now ,  is insanely risky and not worth it at all .
 bro ,  that’s why i bought my mustang a few years back .
 was it tough on the budget ?
 did i have to cut some other things out to afford it ?
 did i still make sure i was saving money ?
 did i enjoy the hell out of that car ?
 i know a lot of budget conscious people would probably say it was a terrible idea ,  but i loved the hell outta that car ,  and i’m so glad i had it while i did (recently moved cross country and had to sell)
 is an examplet like a baby example ?
 i agree to disagree contrary to /u/slade_sez that approach seems energy draining .
 you feed your procrastinator self too ,  once in awhile ,  because it &apos;s part of you .
 you don &apos;t have to outwit the fella if the fella is working with you because it &apos;s part of you anyway- this way you wouldn &apos;t feel too pressured and stressed because who knows ,  it might be too much for you and people have jumped off the bridge avoiding such things and it &apos;s not so much about avoiding but it &apos;s mostly from the energy you spent avoiding so and so
 yes ,  basically from jung’s philosophy ,  there is the self and the shadow self ,  think of it almost like fight club where shadow self would be tyler durden and the base self would be the protagonist .
 the point is ,  deep down you know who you truly want to become as a person ,  but never go after it besides you never accept your “shadow” because either you don’t have the courage to do so .
 in essence ,  jung concludes that the longer you choose to ignore (or better said ,  resist) your shadow self ,  the harder the pull back to it will be ,  perhaps with a much more disastrous impact in order to compensate for the psychological duress of resisting the shadow .
 think of it as people now chasing their dreams and to qualm the feeling of regret ,  their shadow manifests itself negatively in the form of substance abuse rather than positive aggression toward their goals .
 basically ,  you’ll never feel complete unless you can fully incorporate your shadow self with your base self and channel traditionally negative behavior traits to a positive result .
 its what made anakin into darth vader .
 keep making good choices .
 you &apos;re doing great ,  and i &apos;m proud of you .
 this hit me so hard .
 my life exactly .
 that is a phenomenal way of looking at things and i find it commendable that you shared that .
 if myself from 10 years ago showed up to judge me i’d tell them to go fuck themselves and die in a hole .
 i’m assuming the 10 year future version of me will feel the same .
 i &apos;ll wear gloves
 just one should do it
 you mean one sock 
 hey would ya look at that
 #make a run for it .
 #youll never take me alive
 there’s na and other local groups whose members have similar experiences .
 alcoholism cost me many years in my 20s and almost killed me at 30 .
 finally managed to get sober and it’s like i have a completely new start on my life .
 i never knew i could feel this good again .
 good for you both that you get some of those losses back now .
 according to my welsh dictionary ,  the closest word i could find (replacing the i with an l because it looks like an l here ,  let &apos;s be honest) is llwydwyn ,  which is an older word that means  &apos;silver-grey &apos; or  &apos;grey-haired &apos; .
 what does it mean ?
 my god ,  it &apos;s us !
 wanna play striking vipers ?
 being completely serious here ,  calisthenics .
 they &apos;re easy ,  you don &apos;t gotta have weights or any other work out equipment ,  and you can just do like 20 squats and push-ups a day and see decent results over time .
 also ,  get guy to watch naruto .
 when he sees lee drop his weights he &apos;ll wanna start working out more .
 i witness a fight between the guy who wants to sleep ,  the one who needs to gym ,  and the guy who just wants to grind some games every day .
 usually the gym guy wins because he &apos;s strongest but video game guy is smarter than sleep guy so .
 im pretty tired .
 i was literally about to say  &apos;hey ya know that &apos;s meditation right &apos; but you &apos;re totally right in the different ways people perceive the message .
 let all your thoughts and feelings happen around it but let your focus be breathing in and out .
 can conform ,  this actually works
 what i did that really helps ,  is try to do a different activity every single week .
  go to a museam ,  cook a new dish ,  listen to a new podcast ,  etc .
  it helps so so much .
  life is all about balance ,  and i hope you find yours !
 how long have you worked from home ?
 i &apos;ve done it for over 12 years now .
 i don &apos;t know that i could work in an office every day .
 the time lost commuting ,  the has burned ,  dealing with people i just don &apos;t want to deal with face to face .
 it would be nice to have the option to go into an office now and again .
 it does get super lonely some days .
 i &apos;m married and have a kid now ,  and sometimes after being in isolation so long it can be hard to want to talk after a day &apos;s work .
 we had a guy a few years back join our team and quit in less than a month because he hated working from home so much .
 i regularly watch tv in the background when i &apos;m working just to hear talking .
 the office is almost on loop .
 it can be brutal ,  no doubt .
 i &apos;ve a bit of a different take to randy &apos;s .
 i &apos;ve a little audio studio that i goof around making tracks in most days .
 when i used to smoke pot i &apos;d get in these grooves where i &apos;d be jamming on my synth/mixer/drum machines ,  rolling along ,  twisting and tweaking sound just for the sake of the sound .
 it took me a really long time to find that creative headspace again after i quit smoking .
 it &apos;s just something about being carefree and creative when high that i never really feel when i &apos;m sober .
 it &apos;s funny because the current south park season is about randy running a family weed farm .
 see it doesn &apos;t do this to me .
 as soon as i &apos;m high i start doing stuff .
 it &apos;s an instant  &apos;what needs doing ?
 alright ,  let &apos;s go !
  &apos; i get housework done ,  i go out for a run ,  i fix stuff .
 i don &apos;t know how it affects people so differently but it makes me more productive .
 i smoked weed daily from the age of 18 to my early 30’s .
 it’s was basically my hobby .
 then my mum died suddenly and i had a think about my life and realised that i didn’t actually do anything with my time and i wasn’t good at anything (apart from rolling joints that were a work of art) .
 so i stopped and took up playing the banjo .
 the question is ,  am i better or worse off ?
 i can’t really do either in public .
  &apos;remember when people look at you ,  even if they are thinking what the hell are you doing ,  10 seconds later ,  they are right back thinking about themselves .
 you got this ,  mate .
 i can &apos;t motivate myself right now ,  so i &apos;m trying to motivate others to see if that helps .
  i was an absolute stranger to myself .
  i lived purely off impulse with absolutely no regard for the consequences .
  i &apos;d have the occasional lucid moment ,  tried to get people to understand that i seriously wasn &apos;t in control ,  but after all the garbage i pulled nobody was willing to take it seriously .
  i did some research into lexapro and found out it &apos;s a /really bad idea/ to mix with the vyvanse i take for my adhd .
  the symptoms and side effects of that ,  however ,  didn &apos;t totally fit what i was experiencing .
  i spent every day dissociated ,  living in my head while my body did whatever felt good .
 it wasn &apos;t until i &apos;d been off it for a month that i did a little more digging and found research about it triggering hypo/manic episodes in people with bipolar .
  did a little digging in the family history ,  found out there &apos;s 3 cousins and an aunt diagnosed with it with several others who likely lived it without a diagnosis .
  lots of hard drug abuse .
  it scared the shit out of me ,  but at least i have something to work with now i guess .
 there &apos;s three different types of adhd; primarily inattentive ,  primarily hyperactive and mixed .
   &apos;god forbid i get bored &apos; sounds about right .
  ever hyperfocus on stuff ?
  sometimes dumb stuff ,  sometimes actually useful stuff .
 from what you &apos;ve said ,  i &apos;d say a talk with a psychiatrist (not your primary care provider) is in order .
  your life and routine are being severely impacted by stuff in your head; that &apos;s what makes a  mental disorder a mental disorder .
 when i was unmedicated for my adhd (add has officially been combined with adhd) i found that i could be screaming at myself in my brain to do something but if part of me didn &apos;t want to ,  there was nothing that would make me do it .
 i would lose interest in jobs after 6 months .
 i had no real motivation unless i spent days planning it and if one thing got in the way ,  i gave up .
 i haven &apos;t gone back to school yet but thats why i &apos;ve dropped out 3 times before .
 it felt like every day was a constant fight with my own brain to do the stuff i had to do to live .
 i also ate like 3x what my body needed because i was just always hungry .
 i take adderall xr now and if i skip it on the weekends ,  i spend my entire day playing games or laying in bed .
 when i tracked the work i was doing on my game development in line with my medication ,  i found that as my dose was better matched ,  the more work i got done on my projects .
 then i ran out and didn &apos;t refill for about 2 months .
 those 2 months ,  i did basically nothing and my performance at work tanked .
 the only reason anything moved forward for my game development was because of things i setup while medicated coming up .
 i talked to my doctor about how i couldn &apos;t make myself do work even if it was detrimental to myself if i failed to complete it .
 when i finally got on adderall ,  it was like the fight with my brain was over .
 it literally went from: .
 hey ,  we have to do this .
  &apos;no ,  i don &apos;t want to .
  &apos; seriously ,  we have to do this .
  &apos; if we don &apos;t do this ,  we can &apos;t play games later as punishment .
  &apos;no ,  i don &apos;t want to !
  &apos; come the fuck on !
 we seriously have to do this !
 hey we have to do this .
  &apos;okay ,  but i won &apos;t like it .
  &apos;i don &apos;t want to .
  &apos; seriously ,  we have to do it .
 vulcan life grip
 he really is ,  because if you think about it he endured the one kind of pain that even logan cant easily recover from .
 think about the movie logan or the comic storyline its based on ,  old man logan .
 the only reason logan was the old defeated self he was in those stories ,  was because of the tremendous trauma he experienced .
 oc experienced such trauma and is most likely still suffering from it ,  but hes here and he can talk about it .
 thats a feat many iterations of wolverine never accomplished .
 overcoming their trauma .
 so in case oc reads this ,  wolverine wouldnt think that you‘re just as strong as him ,  he would think you‘re stronger .
 thank you ,  i miss her every day .
 so perhaps the trekkies and the star wars fandom are not so different after all .
 to truly hate star trek ,  you must also become either a lurker (babylon 5 fan) ,  a browncoat (firefly fan) or a whovian (dr .
 i know star trek will likely be up my alley ,  i just have no clue where to begin .
 any suggestions for where to begin for someone who loves sci fi but has never seen star trek ?
 that has to be the easiest  &apos;controlled fire &apos; to set ever .
 especially since there &apos;s absolutely nothing there that burns except the lines they run
 its pretty disheartening that he could be so self aware and have such a good plan to avoid that voice ,  and yet still find life unbearable .
 like shit ,  if he couldnt do it ,  with a life as incredible and adventure filled as he had ,  how the fuck are normal people supposed to ?
 yea as well intentioned as his advice is ,  honestly i think it is not a good way of looking at yourself .
 a stress free life is one where the natural thing and the right thing are the same thing .
 sure ,  sometimes that means you need to develop better habits so that the natural thing conforms to the right things .
 but sometimes ,  you need to let go of your idea of what the right things are and expect something more reasonable for what comes naturally to you .
 there is nothing wrong with enjoying life ,  you don’t have to beat yourself up for not wanting to be “on” all the time or pick and choose what is worth your mental and physical energy .
 be compassionate with yourself and balance your needs and wants ,  don’t try to demonize one over the other ,  that is just corrosive to your well being .
 sometimes there isn &apos;t a fix .
 make sure you let your husband know he &apos;s living someone &apos;s dream .
 then again ,  i probably am too .
 the high intensity interval training people may beg to differ ,  but i &apos;m not one of them .
 i &apos;d personally say my choice ,  calisthenics is not any less accessible really .
 a $20 pullup bar is all you need ,  and there &apos;s even ways to avoid buying that .
 i &apos;m pretty sure recent research is showing that resistance training is pretty on par with cardio when it comes to heart health ,  and there are plenty of other benefits .
 i recommend some form of resistance training to everyone ,  but that might be my personal bias showing .
 stoned cold sober
 just run in a straight line away from him .
 eventually you &apos;ll circumnavigate the earth and then his head will explode .
 yes ,  this will require you to run on water .
 it &apos;s the only way .
 i bet if i &apos;ll let him eat cheetos and pizza and binge netflix tonight until 3am he &apos;ll let me win .
 thx for advice btw
 i always thought this was bullshit until i tried it myself .
 it’s actually great advice .
 one of those things is not like the others
 but at least you know you can do it .
 two years is your record ,  and unless you pop out any more kids ,  you have no reason not to beat that record .
 i know it’s not fun to hear but a cigarette ,  drink ,  whatever won’t solve your problems it just makes more later .
 good luck man pm me if you need help .
 i guess we could inter mr .
 cornelius jackson by 15th august 1799 but fuckit ,  let &apos;s smoke some weed and browse reddit for the next 50 years .
 reminds me of when thomas jefferson said “misquotes and reddit go together hand-in-glove .
 i &apos;d rather cry in a maserati .
 e so many people bitching about maserati as if that &apos;s the point .
  &apos;money doesnt buy happiness ,  but it sure can rent a lot of it &apos;
 currently in my 5th year at uni .
 i used to be all about the  &apos;if i don &apos;t finish this degree in 3 years i &apos;m a failure &apos; life .
 it led me to a suicide attempt .
 took a year off to assess ,  made some huge changes (including swapping degrees) .
 much happier now studying fairly casually while enjoying the people and places around me .
 i can tell you from first hand experience it &apos;s fucking awful .
 i did the 4 year degree (i didn &apos;t have choices to take it slower ,  bills to pay and no money to pay them) .
 but holy shit was it awful .
 so awful that when my social psych professor asked us to write about our reason for living the only thing i could come up with was that if i didn &apos;t graduate and get a job my dad co-signed my loans and it would be unfair to him to put him in that position .
 i wasn &apos;t suicidal ,  but when asked why i got up everyday ,  that was my answer .
 life has been so much better since then .
 i &apos;m making a comfortable amount of money .
 work is interesting ,  but not stressful and i &apos;m not expected to work late or try to claw my way up the ladder .
 it gives me a lot of time to do things i enjoy .
 and i live for the time i spend playing with my cat or playing video games or any other number of things i wasn &apos;t doing during college because i didn &apos;t have time
 on the topic of famous deceased chefs ,  chef carl ruiz (rip) lived his life as crazy as he did partly because his dad was a supersaver who planned to go big on retirement .
 and was diagnosed with early onset altzhimers at like 60 or something .
 now i don’t plan on burning fast and bright like that ,  but i understand why someone would want to .
 plan for tomorrow ,  but also try to live today .
 the reward for getting to “someday” faster and bigger is not guaranteed .
 in the face of all this i find it helpful to remind myself that i &apos;m a social creature build for the savannah and not an apartment and a fluorescently lit office .
  i understand the negativity and stress pressure better in this light .
 i &apos;m 29 now and if 19 year old me turned up with a holier-than-thou lecture i &apos;d tell them to come talk to me when they quit chain smoking about their problems .
 ten years is a long fucking time .
 it only really struck me recently that i &apos;ve got a lot of time to get it together ,  it doesn &apos;t have to happen all at once ,  and there &apos;s some of it that will never be together and that &apos;s okay .
 i &apos;ll wear a condom .
 serious question ,  is there a stigma for pot users at a na meeting ?
 i know there &apos;s already an idea of  &apos;you can &apos;t get addicted to pot &apos; ,  and it just feels awkward to go to na for the  &apos;lightest &apos; drug when people are dealing with crack and heroin .
 i &apos;ve heard that people who go to rehab for pot get teased .
 the last thing i need is people telling me i &apos;m making it up .
 you may see it multiple times as you surf /r/stopdrinking .
 this is a uniquely /r/stopdrinking thing that we use as a sign of solidarity .
 today i will stay sober ,  and so will you .
 it is a statement of support ,  and a recognition that no one does this alone .
 stay sober my friends ,  iwndwyt .
 nah ,  that game is gay .
 i &apos;m both uncomfortable and slightly aroused .
 you mean super smash bros
 good plan ,  i &apos;ll bring it up during our next meeting .
 in his defense ,  i use up most of the daily energy reserves that we were supposed to share during my shift and by the time his shift starts he has very little to work with .
 don &apos;t do this- i &apos;ve seen what 100 pushups ,  100 situps ,  and 10km every day will do to a man .
 complete hair loss .
 i will never forget that moment ,  that fight to this day sends shivers down my back just thinking about it
 yeah the guy who needs rest is almost dead .
 gaming and gym guys ganged up on him until he got sick .
 i sympathize with those guys though .
 gaming guy for me is pretty persuasive ,  and unfortunately between my work guy and gaming guy ,  somehow gym guy got the short stick somehow and morphed into sleep guy
 you are a bold one
 i &apos;ve been meditating daily for almost a year .
 i don &apos;t have any religious or spiritual connection with it per se ,  i just find it helps my anxiety/depression and creativity .
 still feels like i &apos;m in a cult sometimes when the subject comes up in conversation though .
 yea i &apos;ve known this for a while due to having been in and our of therapy all my adult life (my parents were insistent and very up to date on mental health awareness) .
  for me its 90% im just bored af .
 a little over a year .
 don &apos;t get me wrong ,  the benefits definitely outweigh the negatives ,  but i enjoy interacting with other people and i don &apos;t really get to do that much anymore .
 it &apos;s also difficult because when my girlfriend gets home i want to talk and hang out with her and a lot of the time she just needs space for a bit .
 my friends are all getting older (i &apos;m in my mid-30 &apos;s) and we &apos;re spending less time together ,  which doesn &apos;t help much .
 in addition ,  my hobbies are mostly solitary ,  outside of going to soccer games .
 rent an office in those places where can have a desk for a month for like $100-200 a month  .
 few times a month and you &apos;ve got friends there who you can talk to
 i used to get that headspace when i first started smoking pot ,  but after a while it went away .
 i &apos;d just sit and smoke ,  and eventually the magic came back in the form of focus when i was sober ,  not stoned .
 i &apos;ve tried pot since a couple times ,  and the magic is there the first time ,  but it &apos;s followed by a couple weeks of smoking myself into nothingness .
 i &apos;ve found that for me ,  it &apos;s just not worth it .
 that doesn’t sound like ‘being bored’ to me
 same boat here ,  friend
 can &apos;t even imagine brother .
 much love from a random dad .
 i can help with this , (grew up on some of the next generation) but my husband is the true trek aficionado .
 (has seen all of the things ,  has many books ,  and watches trek youtube channels .
 ) if i may pm you when he gets home with dinner ,  we can hook you up fam !
 at the big one ,  black rock city ,  maybe .
 at the regionals things are a little more fly-by-night .
 the ones i go to every year are in a pine forest and a pecan orchard ,  perimeter and pyrotechnic control are really important out there .
 i don &apos;t know all the details though ,  i &apos;m not pyro team ,  i &apos;m a ranger .
 it’s typically those that are the most self aware that are the most susceptible to finding life worth ending .
 i think many people have this vision of suicidal people being these tormented soles that wear dark clothing and listen to depressing music .
 when in reality ,  it’s often the ones that are the most keen observers of human nature .
 they spend their lives trying to stay afloat by observing their surroundings and looking for a life raft ,  and occasionally just decide to stop swimming .
 that’s depression for you ,  i guess .
 a normal person can be content with a normal life .
 bourdain lived a life we’d all kill to have lived ,  but something funky (technical medical term) in his brain wiring proved to be too much ,  sadly .
 by learning to be content with less ,  find happiness in the small things .
 i know this because i &apos;m not able to do that right now ,  but i &apos;m working on getting there .
 so anthony had depression ,  similar to what i have .
 unfortunately the depression is always on ,  so you need to have strategies to avoid certain behaviour that make the depressive moments worse .
 i &apos;m fairly confident that &apos;s what he means when he says he needs to keep the momentum going ,  because moments of peace and silence give fuel to the depression ,  and if you give the depression to much space it will kill you .
 remember ,  it &apos;s always there ,  waiting for you to make a mistake .
 i think he was saying relaxation/indulgence can be #5 on your to-do list ,  it just can’t be #1 or you won’t move on with anything
 there is nothing wrong with enjoying life .
 that’s not what he’s saying at all .
 the man pursued hard drugs ,  great food ,  exotic travel ,  fantastic writing ,  and fascinating projects in the pursuit of a life enjoyed (to the best he could despite bouts of depression) .
 he’s merely saying that we’re naturally inclined toward laziness and ,  if given to our own devices ,  would just waste our days away doing  meaningless ,  self-indulgent stuff .
 y’know ,  like browsing reddit sometimes .
 ”sometimes” because sometimes it’s actually quite worthwhile .
 in other words ,  it’s a time-suck whose value varies based on how you use it
 i interpret “stratagems” more as “several tools in his toolkit” – because what works one day might not work the next ,  and so you need as many weapons at your disposal as possible .
 no ,  he clearly didn’t figure out a solution to his depression ,  but it’s not as though seeing a therapist is a guaranteed solution .
 in fact ,  much of cognitive behavioral therapy is arming you with a litany of “tools” and stratagems to confront or manage whatever you’re going through .
 many times ,  they’re effective .
 other times ,  less so .
 some people dig themselves out of depression .
 it’s a hell of a thing .
 you’re edit made me realize we’re all probably living someone’s dream ,  whether or not the dream is short sighted or not .
 sobriety is a trip .
 my husband calls being sober  &apos;raw-doggin reality &apos;
 that &apos;s not a straight line because it follows the curvature of the earth .
 sleep shall be your reward precious .
 in my experience ,  i am not lazy only when i feel good .
 and to feel good ?
 it &apos;s kinda problematic .
 who does math homework ?
 nothing like getting high and doing some math .
 keeping in the spock in my head theme ,  i’m in my fifties and went to purchase life insurance and obtained quotes .
 smoker rates were 3x that of non smoker .
 i know the rates are developed by actuarians that perform complex calculations using data to determine probability ,  pretty close to a real life spock .
 so if the numbers show there is a 3x chance of dying smoking as opposed to non smoking ,  that’s enough to motivate me to butt out .
 and i have for the past five months .
  &apos;i &apos;m already dead .
 or when abraham lincoln famously proclaimed during the declaration proclamation that “thee flagrance of thy quotes on thee internet is that their validity hath not be confirmed .
 i’m getting that tattooed on my ass
 well if you bought a maserati you &apos;ll certainly be crying about it at some point .
 this is the basis of my mindfulness meditation .
  i notice a feeling like jealousy ,  i accept the feeling ,  and then i recognize it as  &apos;not self &apos; because it is just a programmed instinct evolved as a physical structure in my brain to make sure i could get enough to eat while living in some tribe 10 , 000 years ago .
  it &apos;s not my thought ,  therefore i need not be defensive of it ,  and i can let it go .
  most thoughts think themselves ,  but we confuse ourselves by supposing we came up with them ,  and then begin to rationalize them and believe them .
 fuck the social pressure .
  your life is your own .
  you &apos;ve worked hard to undo the damage done by others when you didn &apos;t have choices .
 don &apos;t let others pressure you into having no choices again .
 i &apos;ll wear that condom after you &apos;re done with it .
 nah ,  at least at the na meetings i went to ,  instead of naming a specific drug ,  we just called it doc (drug of choice)
 if they did ,  say ,   &apos;fuck you ,  and this shit show .
 find somewhere or some people who will help you .
 or at least there shouldn &apos;t be ,  and if there is then that &apos;s not a group you want to belong to .
 i know a few people that only used pot that go to my meetings .
 there is a reading at the beginning of every group that goes something like: .
  &apos;the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using &apos;  .
  &apos;we are not interested in what or how much you used ,  who your connections were ,  what you &apos;ve done in the past ,  how much or little you have ,  only what you want to do about your problem and how we can help .
 let me put it this way: there &apos;s more of a stigma if you still smoke pot and go to na .
  you are welcome in na ,  i promise .
 my best friend was definitely a marijuana abuser for a long time .
 he goes to aa instead of na because he feels most na people are court appointed at the meetings he goes to ,  but the aa people usually really mean it .
 my friend when she was first sobering up went to aa and na meetings .
 she was trying to go to a meeting once a day .
  so often strictly aa meetings were not always available .
 mostly went to an all women’s na meeting because she liked the vibe and her sponsor had that has her primary group .
  i went with her a couple times to show support .
  they didn’t judge what others used as long as they were there trying to get better .
  that’s the thing ,   they aren’t there to judge ,   just to support and help .
  my friend has since moved away but from what i hear she is still sober 4 years later .
 i am pretty i am loved
 just say no homo and you’ll be good
 you both seem adorable
 in his defense ,  i use up most of the daily energy reserves that we were supposed to share during my shift and by the time his shift starts he has very little to work with .
 just tell it to him this way: if that &apos;s the case ,  you &apos;ll be running at a bit of a calorie deficit and we &apos;ll lose a bit of weight .
 no lie i have the same guy .
 i play online games and work 12 hour days .
 in between matches of league or csgo i’ll knock out 10-20 pushups or sit-ups .
 it helps me stay in shape while i wait for queue .
 also helps with tilt lol .
 the hardest choices require the strongest wills .
 i used to have  friend that would take  &apos;smoke &apos; breaks during the work day .
 he would just go sit outside (even in winter/shitty days) and maybe bring a coffee or even just a water .
 but he never smoked .
  he just got annoyed that everyone would always ask him what he was going or where he was going and never understood .
  but if he just said ,  quick smoke break ,  no one would question it .
 it began for my mental health but i definitely have a spiritual connection now .
 to my inner self .
 which too many people don &apos;t believe in
 almost two years of meditating coming in .
 it also helps my sleep like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
 i developed sleeping issues out of nowhere and after a few years of that bullshit i began meditating .
 i fall asleep faster and i sleep deeper .
 it has helped in multitudes for my anxiety and even my eating disorder .
 meditation is amazing and more people need to stop and take a breather--literally--once in a while .
 look ,  i hate when people attach themselves to random paragraphs that encapsulates half the working class population .
 but i felt this .
 do y’all ever just get off the train/out of your car after work and just think .
 like really why ?
 if you really think about it ,  not in a morbid way ,  life really is pointless .
 yea ,  sure you can “make your own reasons to live” but that’s just masking the real feelings .
 idk some days i’m feeling happy to be alive and have this unbelievably lucky opportunity to experience life and really self-awareness .
 which at the end of the day is what makes humans so amazing but it’s also the downfall of a lot of us .
 sorry for the rant ,  your comment just hit a chord for me .
 a long history of drug addiction leaves its mark .
 but i also think he was actually very lonely .
 his life seemed amazing on the surface .
 he was constantly meeting new people ,  having interesting conversations ,  traveling the world ,  eating good food .
 but it sounds like he spent a lot of his life in alone in hotel rooms .
 those interesting conversations probably didn’t always deepen into high-quality relationships that he could depend upon when he was feeling the demons particularly strong on a particular day .
 perhaps it was a restless existence .
 i love the man with all my heart ,  but the more i try to put myself into his shoes the more i come to believe he didn’t have an easy life at all .
 that &apos;s the thing i guess .
 i have depression too .
 the past few days ,  i &apos;ve been kind of happy ,  which makes me hope i &apos;m getting better ,  but i know manic episodes exist and i &apos;m dreading when it goes .
 but man ,  if this is what people feel when they &apos;re happy i can see why you fucks want to live so bad .
 maybe if he let himself be happy watching cartoons and eating good food he would still be alive ,  we just wouldn &apos;t know him .
 i think this quote is really about his fears of going back to heroin .
 i think that &apos;s exactly what he meant ,  it &apos;s a shame we both know the feeling as well .
 the depression is always there waiting ,  and i can &apos;t afford to stop moving and let it catch me .
 every day is made up of one tiny accomplishment i have to reach so i can keep the momentum going .
 well ,  everyone’s experience is different of course .
 for my own battles with depression ,  being raised with the idea that nothing but the best is good enough and that i need to justify my existence through working hard crushed me .
 the more successful i was the more i disappeared into this joyless ,  identity-less nothingness .
 soullessly moving between work and social obligations ,  never feeling happy or recharged ,  never making real connections with people because everything was just going through the motions ,  never being able to reflect on myself because all i could see were all the things i wasn’t doing .
 i could have easily been that guy who killed himself who “seemed so full of life” and “had so much to live for” .
 as soon as i let myself be okay with “wasting time” and living life at my own pace ,  everything became so much clearer and focused .
 i started becoming my own person .
 boredom and “nothing” days are when i can reset and recalibrate what is going on in my life - what is working and what isn’t .
 it gives me the space and energy to choose what i need and want to do ,  rather than seamlessly allowing one “should” to drag me to the next one .
  none of the shit i was busting my ass for mattered compared to what i gained by just letting go of all that expectation and burn out .
 but he did say his whole life is just a series of attempts to try to overcome that part of him that’s trying to relax .
 so i don’t think he’s saying what you’re saying .
 life is meaningless regardless .
 just do what makes you happy the end .
 he was afraid of being lazy and going back to heroin ,  and obviously dealt with major problems because of it .
 love the guy to death but everyone in this thread is hung up about what they need to do to have some exciting and interesting life .
 anthony had that and killed himself .
 if you want to smoke weed and watch cartoons and it makes you happy ,  do it .
 if you get bored of that ,  do something else .
 stop overthinking everything .
 life isn &apos;t a movie .
 you don &apos;t have to prove anything to anyone .
 i think this quote is depressing more than anything after what happened and gives a really clear look into his problems and vices that pushed him away from himself and  &apos;free time &apos; to explore his mind .
 he sounds afraid .
 unless eddie was right all along .
 i feel you on that .
 on the days when i wake up and don &apos;t feel good ,  everything becomes 10 times harder .
 my only expertise here is that i &apos;m adhd and depressed as fuck .
 it took me a long time of throwing myself hard into routines that didnt last to figure out the following .
 when you are stuck in a hole ,  it isn &apos;t about putting in enough effort every day to do the things you want .
 it &apos;s about decreasing how much effort it takes to do those things .
 want to start working out 5 days a week ?
 that &apos;s a huge goal and if you throw yourself into it you will only get as far as the first day you didn &apos;t get enough sleep ,  are hungover or sad before your routine is endangered .
 instead ,  five days a week you need to come home and do something small like ten push ups ,  ten sit ups ,  ten leg raises .
 you will want to do more ,  but being over zealous can be as dangerous to your routine as being lazy .
 just tell yourself  &apos;i did what i promised myself ,  i strengthened my routine and i will do more &apos; .
 on your second week ,  maybe do 11 of everything and add one new exercise .
 maybe a month or so down the line ,  you could slightly increase the rate at which you add things to your routine but a good rule of thumb is that if your routine still feels new then it &apos;s not solid enough to  build on .
 eventually ,  you will get home and do a tough workout 5 days a week and realise that it &apos;s taking less effort ,  mentally ,  than that first week .
 what happens when you fuck up and break routine ?
 you get straight back to it at whatever level feels too easy .
 i reckon you &apos;ve got this .
  not even once .
 me too ,  friendship tattoo ?
 to be fair ,  i &apos;m not sure he &apos;ll even get to cry in it given the car would always be at the garage .
 he &apos;d cry in his rental civic the insurance company provides him with in the mean time .
 recycling ,  good for the planet .
 i could have used this 8 and a half months ago .
 na deals with addictions ,  not the drug .
 gambling ,  eating( and or purging) ,  video games (usually with a doc as well) and sex have all been brought up in the meetings i have been to
 how do i find an na group near me where i can listen / talk about my struggle to stay weed free ?
 i &apos;m in the same boat- have had trouble with weed for over 10 years now but am somewhat embarrassed to talk about it and feel like people would shun me at a group meeting because it pales in comparison to some of the more physically addicting substances .
 no ,  you &apos;r adorable !
 also an interesting thing starts to happen when you exercise regularly ,  and it seems counter intuitive ,  but you actually get more and more energy with regular work outs .
 honestly i like games that have small bits of waiting time built in .
 it forces me to step away for a second .
 unfortunately ,  the games i &apos;m playing right now don &apos;t have that .
 i urban dictionaried it .
 no idea how i haven’t heard that in my 13+ years of gaming
 yea ,  sure you can “make your own reasons to live” but that’s just masking the real feelings .
 in my view it’s not a matter of masking the real feelings ,  but about accepting the underlying truth that yeah there is no _innate_ reason to live in the universe .
 when you decide to make your own reasons to go on ,  its not to fool yourself ,  its deciding for yourself that no one or nothing else is going to give you a reason to live .
 so if you want one ,  you better figure it out for yourself .
 i struggled a lot with this when i was younger (my 20s basically) and would say a lot of things like what you’ve said here .
 but i decided that those great days and times you mentioned are enough to hang through the shitty times ,  or that maybe one day i’d even have a family of my own ,  or a great career .
 and as of about 4 months ago ,  i do have all of those things and i couldn’t be more happy that i decided to stick around .
 so yeah ,  i made my reasons up .
 but we all did .
 and they’re all valid reasons .
 whenever my mind goes that way ,  which is honestly pretty seldom ,  i think if i &apos;m actually going to end it ,  then i better actually do something worthwhile with my death .
 so far that moment has never come and we just keep on trucking .
 more times than not i &apos;m glad i have
 no matter how interesting your life might be ,  it &apos;s the thought that you only have your little box to go to at the end of the day that drives you mad .
 if you lived his adventures but the only thing waiting for you was an empty hotel room ,  that &apos;d drive you mad .
 it &apos;s like everything you do is just to forget about that place for a little bit .
 i work on a boat .
 i &apos;m way happier busting my ass all day and sleeping in a cramped cabin with 4 other people snoring up a fucking storm and getting up at 4am for watch rotation .
 my regular job puts me in my apartment at the end of the day ,  alone .
 i have food ,  beer ,  weed ,  books ,  any movie and any game you could ever desire .
 i hate that place .
 overdosed on friendship
 high on potenuse
 start small ,  see little things as victories .
 got out of bed ?
 didn &apos;t take a shower but walked outside for five minutes ?
 i specifically have someone dealing with depression in mind here ,  but the general idea is good for everyone .
 god bless america
 your body gets better at using the existing energy .
 so you can actually take in less energy and get more out of it .
 fucked up on neighbors
 remember ,  friendship is magic .
 and magic is heresy
 that &apos;s a nice angle .
 appreciate the advice .
 i agree celebrating small victories is important .
 i &apos;m actually fairly good at pushing through and getting shit done anyway ,  but it &apos;s just so much harder on those low days .

 wasn &apos;t this exact question asked very recently ?
 isn &apos;t the whole point of reddit to create your own personal echo chamber by curating which subs are in your feed ?
 “well like as miss universe that would like totally make me appreciate like the internet and stuff .
 i would just hope all the countries in the usa like alabama and new york and like california to unite as one across the globe”
 how do you feel about insert agreeable feature
 can americans get access to the filter too ?
 i feel like i’ve seen this just on another sub
 it already exists ,  friend .
 it &apos;s called reddit enhancement suite and you can set up as many keyword filters as your heart desires .
 those filters can be subreddit specific or global in nature .
 not only that ,  you can ignore certain users and you can block posts from a given domain .
 i can &apos;t imagine using reddit without it .
 what i &apos;d really like is a  &apos;karma whore &apos; filter to get rid of all these groupthink posts so i can see some real content .
 this is such a stupid ask reddit .
 i wish there was a fucking repost filter .
 mom says i get to post this tomorrow .
 people of reddit ,  how would you feel if there was “my opinion but as if it’s a question” filter where users seeking interesting discussions can scroll through r/askreddit without seeing dull shit like this ?
 gotta love low effort posts
 is it that time of the day again ?
 depends on what subs you &apos;ve joined .
 when i scroll through my feed it &apos;s mostly dutch related news because that is where i live .
 after reading most of the comments i realised that the op is absolutely right .
 many people are complaining about us related news in their own country subs .
 that us ralated content filter has to become a thing indeed .
 something like a checkbox when you create a post in a non-american sub .
 americanism has become a virus lately .
 america is not the world .
 the world is the world .
 though it &apos;s also the behaviour of many non-americans that have been sucked up by all the american news around them .
 so much that they are now living in it .
 it reminds me of a friend of mine .
 with him it &apos;s only about  &apos;trump did this and trump did that &apos; .
 but also things like  &apos;in america this and in america that &apos; .
 it goes on forever .
 are you also like that ?
 so we can make the rest of the world great again .
 cool ,  as long as this applies to the comments too .
 europeans love to bring the us into every non-related discussion too .
 you could have a video of a dog licking someone &apos;s face ,  then someone would reply  &apos;that happened to me once but i got sick from it &apos; and then someone will reply  &apos;good thing you weren &apos;t in america or you would &apos;ve been put into bankruptcy lololol &apos; .
  and then and endless thread circlejerking about american healthcare .
 it would be useless since theres already a country selector at the top when you &apos;re not on the home page and theres plenty of news subs that ban american-only news .
 people of reddit ,  how would you feel if there was a filter to sort out these stupid  &apos;people of reddit ,  how would you feel if there was (insert agreeable feature) &apos; posts ?
 i don &apos;t see why not .
 we should be able to filter out whatever we want .
 i &apos;m an american living abroad so i like getting news from reddit but i totally understand why people don &apos;t want to be inundated with us news all the time .
 only if i can get a no-euro-bullshit filter
 this exact question was posted about a few weeks back .
 i come here at least partly to find out about what &apos;s going on in the world .
 america is part of the world - for better or worse ,  an important part .
 on the other hand ,  i would rather not hear about how everything that happens in any other country surely relates back to something happening in america in every thread .
 people of reddit ,  can i karma whore ?
 americans make up 49% of the traffic on reddit ,  the next highest is canada with 7% .
 i’m shocked most of the content is american based !
 i would love nothing more than to not have to scroll through europeans commenting on america
 as an european one of the many reasons i like reddit is that is often us focused ,  so i get exposed to news/views/opinions/ideas i otherwise wouldn &apos;t .
 also it &apos;s interesting to compare how you guys are living some events and how media here report it .
 how would this magic filter even work ?
 it would be useless .
 you &apos;d either have to ask every poster on every sub to tag something if it was us-related (so ,  hardly anyone would ever do it) or you &apos;d have to have them tagged manually (waste of everyone &apos;s time and would still miss most posts due to the sheer number of posts being made every second on reddit .
 ) or you could do it the worst possible way and have a bot do it ,  maybe if you &apos;re lucky a well-trained bot might get it right more than half the time .
 the filter would never work .
 most posts would not be properly marked ,  and even if they were you &apos;d still find mountains of us-specific posts in comments of any post ever .
 unless you think every comment would also be somehow tagged as us related ,  in which case: yes sir i &apos;d also like the winning lottery numbers now since you are apparently magic .
 i &apos;m kinda enjoying the whole shit show ,  in a not my circus not my animals kinda way .
 why not just control what subs you subscribe to ?
 stop with the major ones ,  get more local and hobby-focused ,  and the problem should take care of itself .
  then the people who have never been to the usa that regularly dispense their post-adolescent ,  early-undergraduate advice based on 30-second insta videos and memes can fuck right off .
  but they won &apos;t of course ,  because they are fascinated with doing so .
  they &apos;ll ignore the filter and keep right on doing it ,  secure in their superiority .
 yeah so all of you can stop bitching constantly .
 lol they wouldn &apos;t use it .
 for all the complaining ,  people who aren &apos;t from or don &apos;t live in in the u .
 s ,  sure love to talk about everything going on here .
 does it work the other way ,  too ?
  can we prevent foreigners from interfering in domestic political discussions ?
 if so ,  i &apos;m all in favor !
 i mean as long as you can do it for every country i don &apos;t see any issues with it .
 ok its my turn to post this next week .
 wasn’t this asked/posted on another sub a few days ago ?
 yes ,  this was popular every other time it was suggested ,  which is pretty much when anything significant occurs in the us ,  which has been nearly constant over the last 4 years .
 if only reddit wasn &apos;t an american site and other countries had their own internet cultures to fall back on .
 if you don &apos;t want us news ,  consider supporting a website hosted and run in your own country .
 maybe it &apos;s time that a different company and application is made .
 stop using an american app and complaining that there &apos;s too many american things on it .
 i would love this !
 and as an american i would love to be able to turn on that filter
 given that there &apos;s a madman in charge of the country with the capability to turn the world into a nuked cinder ,  who just tried to mount a coup ,  the only thing i am interested in seeing on reddit is effing america .
 at least till 20th jan ,  i really don &apos;t care about r/tifu talking about fingering .
 can americans get in on this ?
 i dont want to hear about this shit either .
 i’m here for picture of puppies and kittens .
 if i wanted the news i would watch the news .
 this is a repost ,  i saw this question a while back
 how would you feel about filtering out  &apos;how would you feel if there was \agreeable feature\ posts ?
 i &apos;d be fine with it as long as i could filter out people bitching about what other folks are posting .
  like this post .
 i &apos;m not opposed to it or anything but i find it weird that people come onto an american website and then complain about seeing majority american content
 can people from the usa use it too ?
 asking for a friend .
 i live in america and i would love this
 this looked like a joke ,  but it actually seems really good !
 i &apos;m both disappointed and pleasantly surprised .
 my dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
 guys ,  i checked ,  it &apos;s sfw !
 this is super useful ,  not exactly easy to find ,  have given it a sub .
 i think it was an /r/unpopularopinion .
 i remember someone told to make this exact post in  a few days time
 now you &apos;re getting it .
 most questions on askreddit are reposts
 dude even got gold and front page for this repost .
 i just saw someone complaining about these  &apos;questions &apos; too .
 it &apos;s not really a question ,  it &apos;s just pandering for karma .
  &apos;how would you feel about reddit having a good search bar ?
  &apos; or  &apos;how would you feel about reddit having a button to scroll back to the top ?
 askreddit is filled with repost bots ,  more than any other sub .
 i &apos;d say 50% of posts are made by bots and another 49 .
 9% by unoriginal people .
 easier said than done .
 join one of the meme subreddits .
 no memes about politics or just no memes about a certain subject ?
 i wouldn &apos;t know a good one for that
 i mostly use it to look at funny animals .
 secondary use is ideas ,  and for that i deliberately avoid echo chambers ,  or break any accidental ones .
 yeah ,  but that &apos;s hard when america is being so loud ,  they break in through the walls of the echo chamber
 i just saw a meme about trump on r/bloodborne .
 so it &apos;s not that simple .
 i curate mine with longboards and mandalorian costumes .
 best echo chamber ever
 fellow redditors ,  how would you feel about every human alive getting $10 , 000 and a machine that dispenses blowjobs sexual favours and cotton candy ?
 now the machine also caters to women so kindly get the fuck off my back
 welcome to r/circlejerk lmao
  &apos;am i the only one around here who likes to breathe air ?
 a feature that lets you scroll back to where you left off my dudes
 mods please fucking do something about this bullshit .
 make a rule or something against this shit
 and how many times is this going to be reposted this week ?
 also ,  f these “how would you feel about x” posts .
 how do you feel about banning these stupid posts at this subreddit ?
 i always report these stupid questions .
 there &apos;s no particular rule they &apos;re breaking but all these  &apos;how would you feel ___ &apos; questions irk me
 this is r/askreddit !
 it &apos;s like going between my home and popular tabs .
 ones great ,  the other politics .
 sure ,  it &apos;s a reddit filter after all !
 while i was thinking the exact same thing ,  there &apos;s irony in the fact that this thread asking for a usa filter has a top comment about what americans want .
 i’d settle for being able to block certain subreddits from ever showing up in my feed .
 it was on unpopular opinion  1 week ago and got to the front page
 it was probably on this very same sub but america bad give upvotes
 most america-specific posts don &apos;t include any america-specific keywords that you could use to filter though .
 us redditors are in the privileged position of assuming their audience is american and their us-specific references/advice/etc .
 are going to be relevant to their readers without any preface or introduction .
 they talk like everyone else is american ,  essentially .
 everyone else quickly learns to preface with  &apos;in the uk &apos; ,   &apos;here in canada &apos; etc .
 you my friend are a hero ,  thank you .
 that sounds amazing .
 is it something i have to install or is it already part of reddit &apos;s system ?
 its a total bullshit way of circumventing the  &apos;open ended question &apos; rule while posting what is effectively a yes/no question
 let’s be ignorant about a country that’s like 40% of worldwide gdp because i don’t care to understand how consequential events in such a country can be worldwide and also because i don’t realize i can already curate my own subreddits i’m subscribed to .
 this post is the crowd pleasing applause equivalent of going on the view as a man and saying how much better and smarter women are .
 if there was a repost filter then reddit will have no content like 90% of the time .
 op’s next post: .
 “how would you feel about a reddit feature that allows you to filter ‘reposts’ ?
 this post is a repost .
 post a  &apos;how would you feel about  &apos;how would you feel &apos; thread &apos; .
 after almost 9 years here ,  it’s how it always was ,  and always will be .
 this post is so dumb .
 like what’s the downside to having this option ?
 why would anyone not want it or actively dislike the idea ?
 they can just not use the filter .
 yeah couldn &apos;t agree more .
 also why the fuck are people surprised an american website ,  with mostly american users ,  talks about american news a lot ?
 i hate how this stupid question got 103k upvotes  .
 haha america bad .
 it’s a bit harder for those of us in the english speaking world .
 i &apos;m subbed to r/thenetherlands but dear god dutch news is boring ,  and i say that as a dutch person .
 following dutch news when there &apos;s world news to be had is like .
 local politics kinda stuff .
  &apos;hey kids we need a new biking lane through this field but the farmers don &apos;t like it !
 stay tuned to watch this thrilling saga unfold !
 like american radicals just stormed the capitol in an event that had the potential to shape world history .
 am i really going to care about whether wopke hoekstra or hugo de jonge takes control of the cda ?
 people of reddit ,  how would you feel about a  &apos;dutch &apos; filter where non-dutch people can browse the internet freely ,  without the ever present fear that a dutchman may be nearby ?
 please send me all the chocomel from your local market .
 german news are almost exclusively about americans now
 that’s the whole point of reddit and these people haven’t managed to figure it out yet
 i couldn &apos;t agree more .
 in canada ,  people are constantly talking about the us and how it &apos;s so messed up ,  etc .
 but like ,  if it bothers you so much ,  just stop watching cnn or going on social media ,  and pick up a book or watch a movie .
 by bringing them up all the time ,  and by clicking all those links ,  we &apos;re feeding the beast that we then complain about .
 there &apos;s definitely people here who know more about american politicians than our own equivalent ones .
 i &apos;ve seen the fuck usa sentiment quite a lot and many times when it isnt relevant at all ,  only said to be petty .
 or the “in my country .
 ” smug comparison comment .
  as if we care .
 if op’s exhaustion with american posts has anything to do with politics ,  i’m pretty confident the volume of us posts will decline starting january 20th .
 biden will be a very welcome low-drama leader
 i like watching sky news but they talk about brexit and boris johnson so much .
 is there a way i can filter them out ?
 wait ,  you &apos;re telling me an american site post american content ?
 this is what confuses me about this complaint .
 is this not a site founded by americans ?
 not for americans but by them and thus with a majority american user base ?
  am i mistaken in thinking this ?
 obviously other countries use it but it feels like international passengers in the tokyo airport complaining about how many things are written in japanese .
 i immediately looked up this statistic too ,  before i dared to look at the comments here .
 i’m also curious to see how these numbers reflect on per capita per country but that would actually require me to look at numbers and do math myself and i guess i’m not that curious .
 but i’m still wondering if half of resistors being american is at least partially just a r/peopleliveincities statistic with the additional filter of “people with computers and free time” .
 americans make up 49% of the traffic on reddit ,  the next highest is canada with 7% .
 i’m shocked most of the content is american based !
 i always think of this when this dumb question comes up .
 it &apos;s an american company with mostly american users so maybe just maybe that is why .
 now now ,  don’t go using fancy numbers and facts to support the truth ,  when it’s much easier to bitch about not wanting to see americanized content on an american-based site .
 a platform created by americans ,  with 49% american internet traffic .
 a real shocker .
 like if we &apos;re going to get rid of american political discussions ,  okay i understand .
 but can we also get rid of the people from other countries who find a way to bring it up in every discussion ?
 yeah we know our government is fucked ,  it &apos;s all we see on the news everyday ,  shut up about it .
 and why is there always a comment with “canadian checking in .
 ” why do the canadians need to tell us they’re canadian every time they comment ?
 if you rely on reddit to inform you on america ,  i guarantee you have a very warped and uninformed view of america
 i think res does it by filtering words from the title .
 so assuming something is titled properly ,  you should be able to block anything with a keyword in the title ,  such as trump ,  capitol ,  covid ,  aoc ,  sanders etc .
 yeah you &apos;d miss out on the odd crossover ,  but small price to pay .
 yeah this hypothetical feature would be entirely pointless for me .
 america is better than anything netflix has to offer rn
 i did unblock /r/politics for the drama of a nation i don &apos;t really care for .
 ever used the frontpage ?
 yeah i &apos;m trying to find the punchline but haven &apos;t found it .
 i mean i could change the banner to actual anime titties to balance it out /s
 r/worldpolitics and r/anime_titties .
 r/potatosalad and r/johncena .
 r/trees and r/marijuanaenthusiasts
 yeah it was something like  &apos;unpopular opinion: reddit needs a usa filter &apos;
  &apos;dear reddit ,  &apos; it started ,    .
  &apos;now do you agree -   .
 that water &apos;s important ,    .
 and air should be free ?
 and would you allow   .
 for a law ,  if you could -   .
 that stated ,  and clearly ,    .
 that vaccines are good ?
  &apos;if maybe they gave you   .
 a billion bucks -   .
 would you own a chicken   .
 that shits when it clucks ?
 would you take a cell phone   .
 that screams when it rings ?
 or other such hugely   .
  &apos;oh reddit ,  for queries   .
 as complex as these -   .
 for questions divisive ,    .
 i &apos;m begging you please -   .
 i &apos;m watching ,  enraptured -   .
 i &apos;m waiting ,  transfixed -   .
 to read your responses .
 i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be mixed .
 it &apos;s so stupid how many reposts and low effort posts get awards .
 who is giving these out ?
 and are they dumb ?
 r/prequelmemes has no politics (but tbf ,  it &apos;s a trilogy about space politics) but there &apos;s memes about not having memes about politics (for the above reasons)
 easier said than done for sure .
 i unsubscribed from all “news” reddit feeds and now they’re just the suggested posts on my timeline .
 so even unsubscribed ,  they still appear .
 i really believe it’s some shady business but i’ll save it for r/conspiracies
 in legaladviceuk there are quite often replies talking about  &apos;pressing charges &apos; ,   &apos;miranda rights &apos; and a plethora of other things that don &apos;t exist in uk law .
 you would think that the subreddit name would give a clue about how the legal system may be different .
 yeah when every sub decides america &apos;s political issues need to be pinned to the top ,  even when unrelated to the sub .
 idunno ,  i havent been getting that much bleedthrough into my feed .
 ive had to actively look for american politics to find information this week .
 how reliable is this machine and can the cotton candy not be made in a seperate machine ?
 i &apos;m not sure i trust where this magical machine is getting its ingredients
 i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t like cotton candy that much
 im thinking paint my willie pink because i am going snorkeling
 i’d like to choose the blowjob/cotton candy machine please .
 that poll would still come out as 50 .
 are the holes for blowjobs and cotton candy separated ?
 at the same time ?
 now that &apos;s kinky .
 wait ,  what about us lads that lost our wankers in a freak heavy equipment accident at the meat processing plant this last july because we were distracted watching porn on our phones ?
 women don &apos;t exist only penis
 would you pick one million dollars ,  if you also had to get a billion dollars ?
 what is the sexiest sex you ever sexed ?
 off to r/unpopularopinion with you !
 i &apos;m confident the last part will be ok
 what an unpopular opinion .
 i &apos;m sure they proposed this a couple of years ago last time this bullshit  &apos;how would you feel about &apos; fad was happening .
  &apos;no loaded questions &apos; is in the rules ,  i &apos;d say applies to this
 how would you feel about a filter that blocks  &apos;how would you feel about x ?
 they are banned under rule 3 .
 they just never enforce it .
 it &apos;s the modern-day  &apos;dae  .
  &apos; (which got rightly banned as it was just upvote fishing) .
 i reall really wish they finally made a rule against these shitty question though .
 how would you feel if healthcare was free for everyone ?
 the problem with political subs is the volume of people that comment ,  but have zero skin in the game .
 if i live in country a and i &apos;m commenting about country b politics ,  i feel comfortable taking an extreme non-nuanced view because if country b burns down ,  it doesn &apos;t really impact me .
 international involvement in national politics is a major polarization force .
 add a version of reddit that makes you prove you’re above 25 years old and i might pay a yearly subscription .
 honestly won &apos;t work imo .
 even if the thread is completely unrelated to the us it won &apos;t stop americans from coming to discuss their political views and downvote your sarcasm .
 you can open a pic of a kid on /r/pics and the orangeman bad karmatrain will be in there somewhere .
 this post reaches hot weekly on r/unpopularopinion
 even when you do they just ignore it ,  seen it in the academia subs ,   &apos;as a european .
  &apos;  &apos;well you should talk to your title 9 officer &apos;
 a bot that asks people in the comments ,  if a post is us-centric will solve the issue .
 yeah although prefacing comments with ‘here in the u .
 ’ isn’t always enough .
 centric subs with ‘u .
 ’ in the title get people from the usa wondering how the issues being discussed affect the usa .
 lol this is so true .
 if i don &apos;t preface my posts with  &apos;i &apos;m not from the us &apos; the post will basically be useless because i &apos;m only getting extremely specific american advice .
 the general motto here on reddit seems to be  &apos;american until proven otherwise .
 welcome to being a woman on here .
 sounds like the rest of us should stop mentioning a country with our posts .
 trump ,  mcconnell ,  democrat ,  republican ,  congress ,  supreme court ,  pelosi ,  schumer ,  schiff ,  melania ,  obama ,  impeachment ,  covfefe ,  hamberders .
 that should filter about 99%
 trump ,  biden ,  gop ,  republican ,  republicans ,  democrat ,  democrats ,  congress ,  senate ,  senator ,  aoc ,  mcconnell ,  pelosi seems to keep most of that filth away .
 there is no true originality .
 i don &apos;t understand how people can be so sensitive to seeing the same meme twice in a year
 “how would you feel about a reddit feature that allows you to post original content ?
 because there are a million posts framed this way ,  and it’s not what this sub should be .
 it’s just a “dae” type post but phrased differently
 even when you &apos;re only joined to local news subs ?
 news in the us feels like an action drama movie that won &apos;t end .
 i miss boring news .
 i am looking forward to a week on the hopefully somewhat near future where i just don &apos;t hear anything about what the president is up to for a week .
 he will be busy ,  he will be doing stuff ,  but it will just be normal governance and i won &apos;t need a breaking news alert and 20 reddit threads about it .
 ah ,  i see that you have not ate enough of our cheese .
 which letter do you want on it ?
 wanted to say the same .
 german media was always a bit more focused on american ,  but since trump was elected things got even worse until it peaked in 2020 .
 i get every tiny news from america but i don &apos;t know almost nothing what &apos;s going on in our neighboring countries .
 i &apos;ve been thinking for months ,  dw might as well rename to amerikanische welle .
 it &apos;s is definitely petty .
 especially the healthcare thing .
 they laugh like americans enjoy going into debt over hospital bills .
 like ,  we &apos;re fucking trying  to get universal care ,  struggling ,  and they .
 laughing at misfortune .
 trumpets are not just going to go away i don &apos;t think
 i love watching bbc but i wish they just didn &apos;t talk about british stuff all the time .
 the problem runs deeper !
 americans on a platform based on  &apos;upvoting &apos; content tend to upvote content related to things that interest them ,  flooding frontpages with content pertaining to american news and politics .
 it &apos;s almost as if that &apos;s reflective of the userbase on a semi-anonymous site where content is posted and then voted upon
 “boris is bad but” .
 “i couldn’t imagine” .
 yup ,  reading comments from europeans telling me certain food items are banned in the us because americans “have no taste” then walking to my fridge ,  grabbing that exact food item and having a snack .
 i’m honestly sick of people who have never lived in the us talking down to me and telling me what it’s like to live in the us (and constantly being wrong) while acting like europeans are some genetically superior ubermensch living in a gilded paradise .
 the worst are australians because their government is as fucked as ours yet they get to ride on the europeans coattails .
 r/crochet got their wool in a knot when us politics got brought up a few weeks back .
 it doesn &apos;t happen often and is incredibly civil over there but somehow us politics leaks into even the smaller ,  hobby based subs .
 #make sure to support net neutrality and write to your congressman .
 that was plastered across every subreddit known to man and pinned to most at one point .
 even /r/babybumps had to make a no politics rule .
 /r/worldpolitics went down the shitter ,  so they shifted to /r/anime_titties .
 i don’t really get it either ,  but that’s what happened .
 worldpolitics refused to remove anything so it got brigated for months by porn ,  hentai ,  memes and dumb shit so they made anime titties as a global news sub as a joke .
 the big unpopular opinion thread i read was basically  &apos;reddit is an american website so american news has the right to be there &apos; .
 the op brought up the example that if you went on a similar foreign website you &apos;d find many of the top news from the home country taking space on the front page too
 can we just post this below every  &apos;do you agree &apos;-question ?
 this may be /u/poem_for_your_sprog  &apos;s greatest achievement .
 it &apos;s a beautiful masterpiece .
 i love coming across your stuff .
 this is a fucking masterpiece .
 every word is perfect .
 oh my fucken god some guy on the halomods discord started saying that water wasn &apos;t a right and the discussion just turned into eating car batteries and 10 people one ounce
 these always make my day but this is the best sprog poem in a good while !
 this has to be the best one of these poems i’ve seen by far .
 good job ,  for summing up the entirety of this subreddit in stanzas
 this is one of my faves .
 not for the rhymes (they are awesome) but for the relevance .
 so here &apos;s the original !
 i saw a copy for the first time just today ,  and thought it was an exceedingly clever poem .
 every single popular subreddit has some posts that are posted repeatedly and repeatedly
 bro you been posting the dancing pikachu for a minute .
 this is not true fellow human ,  also i love coca-cola and recommend it to all my human friends .
 welcome to city 17 .
 may interest you in a chocolate gatorade ?
 it’s tasty and cheap too .
  i &apos;ll let you decide .
 you can sell accounts with a lot of karma ,  to the russians for example
 because in /r/prequelmemes ,  palpatine is the senate ,  and that &apos;s that .
 oh we &apos;re not brave enough for politics !
 r/lotrmemes is where it &apos;s at for high quality non political memes !
 you &apos;re a bold one .
 idk man the prequels were mad political
 “trilogy about space politics” ?
 how else can you call star wars without saying its name ?
 yeah they kinda suck though ,  the memes there get real old real quick .
 they also have a tendency to upvote like crazy so it &apos;s always clogging your feed with rehashed memes ,  i think that &apos;s the biggest problem .
 r/prequelmemes has no politics .
 yeah but it &apos;s a star wars circlejerk so no thanks
 the saddest part about that is that the only part of pressing charges that a us citizen can do is to report the crime .
 so it &apos;s crap advice anyway .
 once the crime is reported the choice to  &apos;press charges &apos; is completely out of their hands .
 they can refuse to testify or recant their statement ,  either of which may or may not get charges dropped .
 but they don &apos;t get to choose if the prosecutor brings charges or not .
 cough cough r/pics
 i dunno ,  is your mother is made from sustainable packaging ?
 salty cotton candy
 and not owning a willy i don’t need blow jobs ,  so i’m doubly out of luck .
 _i see my willie and i want it painted pink_
 i don’t think it was an ‘or’ scenario .
 i think we get the money ,  the blow jobs ,  and the cotton candy .
 a cotton candy dispensing dildo sounds like an automatic yeast infection .
 e: on second thought ,  a cotton candy dispensing dildo is still a blowjob machine .
 cotton candy ,  cunnilingus ,  and coins .
 meme of distraught man unable to decide between two buttons
 people of reddit ,  if you could have everything you &apos;ve ever wanted ever but also everyone you love also has everything they &apos;ve ever wanted and there &apos;s world peace and you cure cancer and you never lose your place when scrolling reddit again ,  would you take 1 billion dollars to have this or not ?
 why do mods even allow for this shit ?
 it &apos;s so obvious it doesn &apos;t belong .
 i &apos;d feel better about outright banning the posts ,  as that &apos;s a system they already have set up .
 i can &apos;t filter by tags of specific subreddits on my homepage ,  which is where i see almost all posts from here .
 there &apos;s already /r/subredditsuggestions /r/redditsuggestions and /r/redditsuggest and they &apos;re all wastelands because everyone knows posting your suggestions to reddit doesn &apos;t result in shit .
 the problem with political subs is that they are astroturfed to hell .
 they are absolutely dominated by bots and shills with inorganic vote totals .
 people should absolutely be aware of this .
 and for some stupid reason american elections have 2 whole years of campaigning so in essence the majority of the time is a lead up to an election .
 i think it &apos;s life &apos;s quality that goes down during elections .
 if you’re gonna pay make em add an age restriction too .
 i meet plenty of cool teens online gaming ,  but when they group up they’re the fuckin worst .
 gaming subreddits ,  random subreddits either have a post referring to politics ,  or the top comment is about politics .
 i know politics is important and dictates basically everything in a country (education ,  health ,  safety ,  services ,  social services) ,  but politics should be kept to relevant subs .
 like ,  on the vive subreddit there is a post about trump being banned on facebook ,  so he can &apos;t use an oculus .
 what the fuck is that about .
 it completely ruins popular subs because some pea-brain thinks he &apos;s being clever with a low effort meme and it gets voted to the front by the rest of the herd from a political sub .
  &apos;hurr-durr trump balloon !
 so funny right guys ?
  &apos;hurr-durr creepy joe biden !
 it &apos;s true ,  right guys ?
 oh boy ,  can &apos;t wait for the wave of cutting edge  &apos;hilarity &apos; come inauguration time .
 the quality of post in r/shitamericanssay goes up .
  &apos;quality &apos; is an arbitrary term
 and i dont think a filter would catch all those commenters who insist on interjecting politics into every unrelated conversation they can .
 if only it were just around election time .
 the quality of reddit and the bias has been ruining it for the last 4 years .
 the massive intake of retards hasn &apos;t helped .
 if there were any other place similar ,  without megalomaniac mods ,  i &apos;d be there and dump this place asap .
 i would do it in an instant .
 i’m an american in new york .
 evidently i’m supposed to give a shit about everything relating to politics ,  blm ,  proud boys ,  mitch mcconnell ,  american greed ,  tesla ,  and everything other goddamn thing .
 but the thing is .
 i’m a happy scientist .
 i have a challenging career ,  i like to cook ,  and i build things out of wood .
  i’m so sick of seeing so much vitriol because it’s not how i live irl so why the hell do i have to have it force fed down my throat on a ‘global’ website .
 i’m well aware of america’s problems .
 but it’s like lecturing your infant child about your marital problems .
 i’ve unsubbed from all the problem subs but it fucking permeates everything .
 if i could completely block out all of america in reddit i could finally cut one more toxic thing out of my life .
 i unsubscribed from just about anything that would feature trump ,  but he &apos;s fucking around in so many different ways ,  it &apos;s just getting all over the place .
 i &apos;m just sitting over here in germany ,  involuntarily watching from across the pond as it all goes down .
 i sorted by popular in the last hour yesterday and __every .
 ___ was about capitol hill .
 i made it 5 pages in before i found something better to do .
 /r/politics infects every subreddit that it can
 you’re acting like people over 25 can’t be idiots
 it won &apos;t stop americans from coming to discuss their political views and downvote your sarcasm .
 we europeans are about 100 times more interested in american politics than we are in the politics of our own country (goes for me too) .
 you can see it in the news too .
 and some asians (vietnamese ,  chinese) because they aren &apos;t really allowed to discuss their domestic politics lol ,  but there &apos;s not much of them here anyway .
 this is arguably my biggest issue with reddit .
 too many bullshit ,  unsupported ,  incorrect ,   &apos;because it &apos;s funny to say it &apos; comments getting upvoted .
  high upvotes increases visibility of the comment ,  which makes people think that what they &apos;re reading is actual fact and true ,  when in reality it &apos;s just a karma-farming circlejerk of bullshit .
 people can &apos;t even write  &apos;i agree with this .
  &apos;  it has to be just  &apos;this .
  &apos; and gets like 5000 upvotes .
  how fucking lazy and uninformed have we become ?
 you &apos;re right in that any every thread is highly likely to devolve into an america centric political discussion ,  it &apos;s hardly just americans who contribute to this phenomen .
 i &apos;m quite often  seeing  &apos;as a european/south american/martian etc .
  &apos; type comments at some point too .
 unpopular opinion is just a sub for people to post their opinions for validation .
 except the cereal and water guy ,  fuck him
 they forgot the un in that sub
 sort r/unpopularopinion by controversial of all time to get the real gems .
 r/politics is actually us politics .
 it’s in the description .
 and r/worldnews as americans news part 2 .
 i was accused of wanting to name my kids something “weird” ,  when it was just a traditional name in my language .
 i clearly mentioned i wanted scandinavian opinions .
 and when i said i hadn’t tasted mac and cheese and that it isn’t popular in my country ,  people were like “can’t you just buy some brand i’d never heard of ?
 this was in facebook groups though ,  and facebook is a site with even less americans ,  indians are the biggest user group .
 i &apos;ve seen it in the decidedly not academia subs for game deals ,  deals clearly tagged as eg .
  &apos;canada &apos; for $60 (25% off $80 ,  but the regular price in the us) .
 without fail ,  someone will say  &apos;that &apos;s the regular price ,  how is this a deal ?
  &apos; and someone else without fail will respond  &apos;this is a canadian deal &apos; .
 i remember one person tagged a post as canada ,  and then started the post with  &apos;this is a canadian deal this is a canadian deal this is a canadian deal this is a canadian deal this is a canadian deal &apos; .
 someone snarkily commented  &apos;is this a canadian deal ?
  &apos; someone else unsnarkily commented ,   &apos;how is this a deal ?
 that &apos;s the regular price &apos; .
 thats a good way to let your community generate shit data .
 post: « here in the u .
 top comment: « if this was in the us .
 i like this idea ,  as a small prank .
 just talk like everyone was from where you are .
 did you know there &apos;s ski trail already ,  and it &apos;s in a good condition .
 the city did good job with that one .
 add florida to that list as well as the names of any current political leaders since that changes from time to time
 fakenews ,  orange man ,  mcconnell ,  pelosi ,  cuomo ,  fox news ,  electoral college ,  chicken wings ,  olives (not american ,  but they’re gross) ,  eddie murphy ,  tom selleck ,  cuckold porn ,  amazon
 i get annoyed when i see 5 instances of the same post while scrolling .
 it happens mostly in the big subs but more specific subs have it happen to them as well ,  people need to look before posting something honestly ,  chances are you aren &apos;t going to be the first one if the sub you &apos;re posting to has more than a hundred thousand members .
 i &apos;ll laugh my ass off at a meme i &apos;ve never seen before and then go to the comments and see post telling people to stop reposting .
 this site is used by millions of people a day who aren &apos;t on it all day like a lot of us .
 also the upvote and downvote option works better than looking like a baby in the comments .
 some redditors complain that they saw an image 12 years ago .
  &apos;how would you feel about a reddit feature that allows you to repost original content ?
 nah its like you join r/interestingasfuck or r/animalsbeingderps just for general solid internet content but even those subs are full of assumptions that everybody is from the usa .
  &apos;which state are you from ?
  &apos;  &apos;oh wow you must be foreign &apos; .
 even r/scotland (my country &apos;s sub) is full of americans ,  and often they &apos;re in the top comments giving it  &apos;oh imagine if trump .
  &apos; ,  or they &apos;re pretending to be scottish - and you can tell because they try to type with a  &apos;scottish accent &apos; but fuck it up .
 it can be a bit much at times .
 this isnt a local to anywhere here and we are still discussing how intrusive america ,  or more specifically its politics are .
 shit is everywhere .
 my local city sub had a clip the other day of a little gaggle of flag waving trumpets wandering through part of melbourne australia .
 granted all the byatanders in the clip were also wondering what the fuck was wrong with them but its still pervasive enough to do that .
 i &apos;m a bit of both .
 the thing is ,  i genuinely take an interest in us news .
 it &apos;s relevant professionally ,  i have a lot of friends there ,  and what &apos;s happening there often connects to some things here .
 but it would be great to hear about the exact same event from 20 different slightly different angles less .
 so maybe have a  &apos;filter 85% of us news &apos; option or something .
 just to dial it down a bit .
 imagine living it
 the worst part is that obviously many german journalists read american outlets and then (intentionally or not) start propagating the same narratives in their own articles .
 american news is highly partisan and especially when it comes to foreign politics ,  you rarely ever get neutral coverage .
 for example back in 2003 ,  german coverage of the iraq war was fairly neutral .
 it wasn &apos;t as critical as it should have been but at least it wasn &apos;t as warmongering as us media .
 yet if the iraq war happened tomorrow ,  i bet nowadays the german media would almost be fully behind it and just parrot what us media is saying .
 yeah and dont forget the  &apos;you were born on us land so you most accept every sin the country has made since its inception &apos; type mindset people have .
 no ,  but their footprint in mainstream social media is being diminished
 it pisses me off when i watch basketball and the only sport they talk about is basketball .
 why does top gear almost always drive right handed cars ?
 i want to see them drive the cars of the rest of the world that they don &apos;t live in .
 i love watching bbc but i wish they just didn’t talk about big black cocks all the time
 and i &apos;m not even american ,  i &apos;m british but there &apos;s so many british and europeans in general who talk about america and shit .
 it &apos;s fucking retarded man .
 those people are obsessed with feeling superior to the us and then will complain that non political subreddit are filled with politics
 wouldn’t that be a moderator issue ?
 world politics went omega karma-whore mode posting  &apos;upvote so _ is the first thing you see when you look up _ &apos; and shit like that ,  mods did nothing about it ,  users became aware of the lack of moderation and started posting hentai ,  and now the mods gave in and now its basically a partly anarchy subreddit
 i was kind of disappointed when i didn &apos;t see any anime boobs ,  so i instead read their origin .
 you can go there and click on the  &apos;about &apos; tab for a timeline and breakdown ,  but basically worldpolitics was really bad ,  with a common problem being that people would post some image from google with a politician looking dumb and the post getting loads of upvotes .
 since the mods wouldn &apos;t curtail these posts ,  a guy got fed up and just posted a picture of an anime babe in protest .
 anime titties got upvotes in worldpolitics due to how poorly the subreddit was run ,  so some people made an actual world politics subreddit called anime titties .
 i probably fudged some details ,  but hope that helps you understand the humor .
 worldpolitics got spammed by  &apos;upvote this so it is the first google result when googling insert trump/ epstein .
 it got so annoying that someone said fuck it ,  mods ain &apos;t doing shit ,  i &apos;ll just posted anime titties and it didn &apos;t get deleted .
 from there on the great war of the 4 armies commenced .
 after the anime titties ,  the thots came ,  after them r/warhammer40k joined to clean worldpolitics of any heresy and last but not least the potted home plants established some strong roots .
 during this time redditors of the first anime_titties wave thought about making another worldpolitics subreddit without a focus on us politics and thus r/anime_titties was born .
 i think nowadays we have a truce with a peaceful coexistence of anime titties ,  thots ,  40k and potted plants ,  but i &apos;m no historian .
 i &apos;m just a mere observer when everything unfolded in the chaotic age of 2020 .
 please correct or add something ,  if i missed anything
 yeah ,  like ,  i &apos;m empathetic to the plight & will probably be downvoted for this but people sincerely get too angry that an american-based website ,  run and made by americans ,  with americans being the largest userbase ,  in mostly english ,  is too concerned with american affairs .
 the same happens on twitter ,  too .
 stop getting mad at users from the us who post and upvote issues that they care about & stop getting mad at the site for pushing out news about the us .
 curate your content a bit more judiciously ,  unsubscribe from r/politics ,  r/news ,  etc .
 and avoid browsing r/all if you really cannot stomach even glancing at us news .
 i genuinely do not understand how it is an issue when all you have to do is scroll past the shit you don &apos;t care about .
 no one is making you read it .
 redditors of reddit - how would you feel about posting a poem_for_your_sprog poem after every extremely obvious and repeated askreddit question ?
 yeah but then reddit would bitch about reposts .
 sprog saying what we &apos;re all thinking .
 but with much better phrasing .
 how do you feel about a button that takes you back to the top  .
 i have seen many people and ted cruz is one of them
 although we definitely love democracy
 well it is a sw sub .
 do you realize how fucked everyone would be if people could circumvent the police and press charges against whoever they want ?
 people are insane .
 no ,  they &apos;re put in that spikey styrofoam stuff .
 this burn was appropriately written
 i think he’s saying he wants to demo a few models to help with the selection .
 i figure there &apos;s different parts to this machine therefore you wouldn &apos;t get cotton candy and fucked at the same time .
 also people over 70 have to take a driving test every year
 we don’t like it either .
 many thanks ,  kind stranger .
 2 years of campaigning every 4 years is a nightmare ,  there is something gravely wrong with american elections .
 it &apos;s weird that american politics is so much about  &apos;candidate y spent x million dollars on campaigning this year &apos; .
 canadians think a 3 month lead up to an election is a loooooong time .
 the american method is mad .
 i am no expert but figured it was all about the money ,  stuffing the pockets with cash and nothing to do with what they will do for the everyday citizens .
 how else would you make everybody insane enough to guarantee all that ad revenue from media broadcasts covering the insanity ?
 honestly i am getting to the point where i might start voting for whoever interrupts my youtube videos less .
 i think its life’s quality going down in general .
 for non-americans it &apos;s just reddit quality
 i think it &apos;s life &apos;s quality that goes down during elections .
 and thanks to unlimited money in politics ,  it &apos;s always election season .
 we may a couple months of relative quiet here ,  but soon we &apos;ll be hearing about the midterms .
 if i could get a 21+ filter on reddit i would _definitely_ pay for it .
 yea you’d be on r/aww looking at a litter of chocolate labs and somebody comes in saying “yea if these were people ,  trump would be corralling them into cages !
 like please just leave it alone .
 i like to come to reddit to escape .
 i’m looking at pleasant things and then have to be constantly bombarded with how shitty our politics/media is .
 it &apos;s been like this since the 2016 election cycle began .
 before that you &apos;d mostly only see politics around elections ,  but since it was trump we need to hear about his every move every day .
 at my university ,  the pol-sci degree had a sudden year to year 50% increase in applications due to the trump effect ,  too .
 every aspect of our lives is now politics .
 i &apos;ve used a filter to filter out 100 subreddits (you can &apos;t filter more than 100) ,  and i still see new political subreddits with the same content popping out (and i am convinced that &apos;s their point ,  like how there was 20 different bernie subs ,  as soon as they saw less traffic they assumed everyone &apos;s filtered them out so they created a new one .
 good thing is ,  now that trump is gone ,  we won &apos;t see as many political posts :) .
 they probably chose 25 because that &apos;s when the brain fully forms .
 that doesn &apos;t mean every 25+ person is more intelligent than anyone younger but a pre-frontal cortex does come in handy for rational thinking .
 half the grown ups on my facebook act worse than my teenager .
 i would enjoy a 25+ reddit for the same reason i enjoy 25+ bars .
 people over 25 can be idiots .
 but ,  at least they have experience with it ,  and a lot have the humility to admit it .
 every teenager thinks they are a genius ,  and their short-sighted ,  self indulgent ,  unempathetic and are just the worst people .
 that is a blanket statement .
 your thought on this is valid .
 consider though that many people visit reddit for laughs and to kill time ,  not to get their news .
 if you come here for news or think upvotes and downvotes equate to facts and falsehoods ,  you &apos;re already lost .
 it’s either people posting extremely agreeable opinions on reddit ,  or people making up obviously fake wild opinions for upvotes .
 sorry ,  i don’t buy that you prefer washing your hands and sleeves at the same time
 hey ,  my great-grandfather enjoys his cereal with water .
 and i agree it’s downright disgusting .
 who would do that to themselves ?
 i tried it once and it’s so awful .
 you can’t even drink the water after you’ve eaten the cereal .
 first one i saw was “employers should be allowed to ask women if they are going to get pregnant before they hire them” .
 i guess that is an unpopular opinion
 hell ,  even r/pics has become a cesspool of american political photos off late .
 we have r/anime_titties for global politics .
 luckily there &apos;s /r/anime_titties
 this is what irks me .
 i want to follow world news not american news that have a  &apos;world &apos; influence .
 is there any sub that has actual world news ?
 wait ,  when did r/worldnews become world news again ?
 what happened to the terrible memes and porn that caused people to create r/anime_titties ?
 well they had to do something to make up for banning people from the beach .
 after every conversation a whole new mutual town/city would be born a place with skiing and a shitty beach
 it’s a good laugh once a month
 chicken wings tho ?
 well we don &apos;t wanna miss out on american dad season 32 .
 we &apos;re not animals .
 and then you see another two repost of the same shit only six days later .
 the next month they start all over again .
 i consider them karma farmers and therefore downvote almost everything that i &apos;ve seen too often .
 i &apos;ve never seen .
 but that wouldn’t have been a problem in the first place if content wasn’t pushed down by endless already posted things .
 my favorite is seeing repost cross posts of repost cross posts from 24h prior in r/all .
 you’re spot on with the upvote and downvote observation .
 just ignore or even downvote something you’ve been seeing too much and move on .
 if others agree with you then the posts won’t go to hot .
 yeah that always bugs me .
 say it got like 12k upvotes so obviously most people either haven &apos;t seen it or don &apos;t mind seeing it again ,  and there &apos;s always a couple people complaining about a repost .
 username checks out
 damn that &apos;s just bad moderation though .
 the mods over at r/thenetherlands are a bit much at times but it is a high quality sub because of it .
 what annoys me is the two letter acronyms for the states like is ma michigan or maine ?
 ne nevada or nebraska ?
 i don’t expect americans to know any council areas in the uk let alone an acronym for it
 this is what’s annoying about americans on reddit ,  and you can’t solve it with a filter .
 it’s so irritating being on british problems or a sub specifically for people who are not american ,  and having to deal with all the “what ho i’m pretending to be english i drink tea and eat scones” .
 like ,  nothing is sacred with these guys around
 wow ,  like if they &apos;ve forgotten trump only rules in the usa and not all of the english world .
 sure trump also makes headlines in the news over here .
 especially 2 days ago ,  but we will not forget that we live in an entirely different country .
 those people conveniently ignore any history of their own countries as well .
 all countries have their good and bad .
  america has shit people ,  uk got shit people ,  eu got shit people .
  it &apos;s the shit people ,  not the nationalities
 isn &apos;t britain almost as bad as the us for a lot of the things those people are constantly dunking on us for ?
 and i absolutely love it
 so kind of like the situation with r/trees and r/marijuanaenthusiasts each having the content you would expect the other to have ?
  &apos;dear reddit ,  &apos; it started ,  .
  &apos;now do you agree - .
 that water &apos;s important ,  .
 and air should be free ?
 and would you allow .
 for a law ,  if you could - .
 that stated ,  and clearly ,  .
 that vaccines are good ?
  &apos;if maybe they gave you .
 a billion bucks - .
 would you own a chicken .
 that shits when it clucks ?
 would you take a cell phone .
 that screams when it rings ?
 or other such hugely .
  &apos;oh reddit ,  for queries .
 as complex as these - .
 for questions divisive ,  .
 i &apos;m begging you please - .
 i &apos;m watching ,  enraptured - .
 i &apos;m waiting ,  transfixed - .
 to read your responses .
 i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be mixed .
 r/copypasta will have kittens
 bitching about bitching about reposts is so reddit .
 actually he isnt saying what we were all thinking since hundreds of idiots gave awards to this repost .
 its treason ,  then
 our allegiance is to the republic ,  to democracy !
 yeah but don &apos;t you think we should add a star wars filter to it to remove all the star wars so people there could read it without seeing anything star wars related ?
 oh ,  i &apos;m not staying they should be able to .
 just pointing out that not only is not applicable to the uk ,  it &apos;s not even applicable to the us .
 it &apos;s just bad advice ,  period .
 lets not rule anything out just yet .
 i &apos;ll bring it up at the next american meeting .
 change your debate format too it sucks lol
 it is very on brand for us ,  though
 cant support a gross poor person
 i &apos;ve been saying for years that a cap on campaigns would vastly improve our elections and candidates .
 we could actually get people who aren &apos;t mill/billionaires or have friends like that .
 the amount of money that is wasted and spent on these ,  plus all the bribery makes me die inside everytime
 thank cable news .
 god forbid they actually had to find real news to report .
 i think 3 month lead up is long .
 here in uk i think it &apos;s more like 6 weeks but i forget the exact length
 good thing is ,  now that trump is gone ,  we won &apos;t see as many political posts :) .
 remember this comment and revisit it in a month or so ,  going to get even worse
 now you &apos;ll see biden comparisons to trump for 2 years .
 but yes it &apos;s absolutely astonishing to me how much people constantly want and need to know about what trump is doing .
 i think people get that dopamine hit on it now and it &apos;s becoming addictive to them .
 good thing is ,  now that trump is gone ,  we won &apos;t see as many political posts :) .
 guarantee this will end up on aged like milk .
 half the grown ups on your facebook aren &apos;t on reddit ,  i &apos;d assume .
 scroll down to find the literary achievement that is  &apos;boogers actually taste nice &apos;
 pics is the biggest garbage subreddit of them all .
 r/pics is one of the main reasons we need a  &apos;shit that should be on facebook or instagram &apos; filter
 r/pics has been cow shit for a long time .
 come join us at r/nocontextpics for some good quality stuff
  &apos;i became a citizen today &apos; 900k upvotes
 the single best move i made in my reddit career was leaving r/pics for r/nocontextpics .
 it always makes me giggle how this is legit the best news subreddit around .
 /r/anime_titties is good for world news .
 (ignore the name lol)
 /r/anime_titties (no joke)
 you &apos;re thinking of /r/worldpolitics
 the mods stopped moderating worldpolitics ,  and so people started posting lews drawings of anime girls and other shit .
 anime titties simply came to the rescue ,  and decided to resume functioning as worldpolitics was supposed to be .
  it was a stream of consciousness that evolved as i sat on the shitter .
 half the time it &apos;s 90% of the comment thread .
  &apos;oh hey this is a funny video/gif/meme ,  let &apos;s see what &apos;s in the comments ,  oh apparently i &apos;m not allowed to like it because it was posted before two years ago &apos;
 i mind  &apos;old &apos; reposts when it &apos;s oc such as an artwork .
 and it &apos;s especially insulting to the op when the reposts gets more upvotes (which happens a lot since reposts are usually popular posts) .
 oc creators spend time making things and reposters dont even credit them more often than not
 something that strikes me is when you ask  &apos;where are you from ?
  &apos; and you get a city and state back .
  &apos;originally i &apos;m from tennessee but i went to school in new jersey &apos; .
 we don &apos;t do that here .
 it &apos;s quite funny to imagine me saying  &apos;well i grew up in glasgow city ,  but now i live in south ayrshire &apos; and expecting people to know what i mean .
 that &apos;s the point though i think - i would maybe say something similar to another scot ,  and americans will likely presume they &apos;re talking to another american so they presume you know what those things are - even in a hostel in uruguay or whatever or on reddit where i could be from anywhere in the world .
 it does piss me off when americans attempt to write in an  &apos;english &apos; accent that sounds nothing like how people speak .
 also pretending to not be american but still using  &apos;y &apos;all .
 the problem with sharing a language is that the other countries pick up on it too ,  and very quickly ,  and america-centric issues suddenly become viciously  &apos;anglo-centric &apos; problems .
 many of the actions of america in the past 4 years have encouraged like-minded individuals in the uk to do things that simply don &apos;t apply to the hospitality or services you find in the uk .
 talking about the canzuk countries moreso than other predominantly english-speaking countries .
 here i &apos;ve seen some people were posting stuff like  &apos;biden isn &apos;t my president !
  &apos; on social media and i &apos;m just like right ,  as a german that &apos;s frank walter steinmeier .
 i really can &apos;t unterstand how you can act to involved in the politics of a country you have absolutely nothing to do with .
 you &apos;ve probably never even been there or know anyone there so why do you act like this affects you and your personal life in any way ?
 yeah we are ,  my usual point is that we both fucking suck compared to a lot of countries .
 only 8 months ago ?
 i remember seeing the sub in 2019
 r/potatosalad and r/johncena ,  too .
 also r/amish shares content with r/goodcardibsongs .
 r/worldpolitics is a mixed bag
 yet so happily supportive of each other in that case haha i love when somebody accidentally posts their favorite tree to r/trees and a lot of the stoners just contribute their thoughts because they’re big fans of nature .
 when stoners post on r/marijuanaenthusiasts of their plants and such the avid arborists are always happy the mixup happens anyways
 who’s gonna make the bot for this ?
 but then so is bitching about bitching about bitching about reposts .
 i like to think that one idiot gave hundreds of awards
 spiralling screeching jump
 well we have a deal then
 those meetings are held at the capitol building right ?
  think i just missed the last one .
 sure let me just get right on that
 hey bud i think you &apos;re mistaken: we spend that much money on politics to buy the best democracy on earth !
 just like our healthcare system !
 wait ,  what &apos;s that now ?
 both the government and our healthcare system are failing ?
 this applies to so much
 ours are similar .
 but we recently had a long one .
 i literally cannot imagine going through that for years .
  &apos;far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun .
 orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea .
 this planet has or rather had a problem ,  which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time .
 many solutions were suggested for this problem ,  but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper ,  which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy .
 and so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean ,  and most of them were miserable ,  even the ones with digital watches .
 many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place .
 and some said that even the trees had been a bad move ,  and that no one should ever have left the oceans .
 that &apos;s why i &apos;m keeping expectations low .
 if i survive the year ,  i &apos;ll consider it a good one .
 yay we passed the tutorial
 funny and showerthoughts could give pics a serious run for its money .
 most of the big defaults are extremely bad .
 some days it feels like i have half of r/all filtered just from subreddit filters .
 r/worldnews exists and only allows us news if it is specifically regarding international policies .
 may i recommend you r/nocontextpics which allows only the word pic to be in the title ,  avoiding the sob story posts and making it just photos
 thank you for adding for real at the end
 slightly disappointed in the lack of titties but the lack of america-centric news is a fair exchange .
 although that sub only talked about bernie sanders until it became a lawless wasteland ,  so it was hardly world politics
 american politics are entertaining .
 it &apos;s like a tv show where you never know what crazy thing will happen in the next episode .
 oh yeah i forget angela merkel is chancellor and not president .
 as someone from uk where we don &apos;t have president just prime minister which is more important or has more power out of president/chancellor .
 because the news always portrays angela merkel as the german leader but in general its said that prime minister is roughly equivalent to president just with the powers the queen has rolled into the role .
 feels like it right ?
 it &apos;s the one place where the word  &apos;porn &apos; implies sfw .
 oh man the last two was really good .
 thanks for the laughs :)
 whoa ,  what the hell happened to r/amish and r/goodcardibsongs ?
 it looks like all their posts got nuked
 worldpolitics has phases ,  really ,  they had a jojo and a warhammer one too on top of the pron
 should be its tag name or whatever you call that .
 # pack it in boys ,  slobs on knobs are back on the menu
 close ,  this time were going inside and we &apos;ll have coffee and snacks in the men &apos;s restroom right next to the chamber .
 we even have an interrobang shortage
 we &apos;re not failing !
 everyone else is just jealous !
 ours (canada) is min of 36 days ,  max of 50 .
 some poor ,  phoneless fool is probably sitting next to a waterfall somewhere totally unaware of how angry and scared he &apos;s supposed to be .

 years ago i went travelling in venezuela with my husband .
  one day ,  when we were paddling down the orinoco through the jungle in a dugout canoe with our guide ,  the heavens opened and we had to drag the canoe in to the bank to shelter .
 after a while ,   this guy appeared out of the trees .
 he was wearing nothing but a cord round his waist and was carrying a spear .
 he kept us company in a friendly sort of way ,  smiling and gesticulating .
 when the rain stopped ,   he disappeared into the trees again .
 days like these  i think about that guy ,  who wakes up every morning ,  ties a cord around his waist ,  picks up his spear and sets off into the jungle .
 your expectations are still high
 i &apos;ll consider it a good year if i don &apos;t survive
 r/funny isn &apos;t funny and r/showerthoughts doesn &apos;t have shower thoughts .
 just like how r/unpopularopinion doesn &apos;t have unpopular opinions and r/askreddit doesn &apos;t have questions that hasn &apos;t been asked a million times already
 shower thoughts is just r/im14andthisisdeep 80% of the time .
 yeah ,  it &apos;s a good sub ,  but it &apos;s just a bit annoying there when someone posts a photo of something interesting and then there is no information about what/where it is
 i mean ,  i was very skeptical when someone told me about it way back when .
 gonna have to click just to make sure you &apos;re not lying .
 technically the same .
 both with no usa context .
 here &apos;s the joke: .
 what would you post to r/goodcardibsongs ?
 and why would the amish update their page ?
 except in programming ,   !
 dumbquestion means  &apos;not dumb question &apos; ,  so like good idea but maybe use something else .
 looks like meat &apos;s back on the menu boys !
 is that the one where they smeared poop from ?
 total class act .
 hands down my favorite poem i’ve seen of yours .
 history textbooks of the future need to start the chapter on this week with this poem .
 you should submit this to the new yorker .
 you are a true talent .
 yesssssss i’m so glad sprog is still here ,  i thought they’d left .
 this is pure gold .
 roses are red ,  violets are blue .
 they don &apos;t think it be like it is ,  but it do
 this one’s very shel silverstein .
 but we can &apos;t ration them - that would be communism
 digital ,  or analog ?
 what kind of watch was he wearing ?
 going any lower means wishing for death .
 i &apos;m cautious ,  not in despair .
 this is the one that gets me the most r/unpopularopinion ,  like ,  the post have to be things that &apos;d otherwise be downvoted to hell ,  not things that we all agree on .
 unpopularopinion - -  my father verbally abuses me ,  so i don &apos;t love him .
 fuck me ,  what a take !
 not loving someone who doesn &apos;t seem to love you .
 r/askreddit doesn &apos;t have questions that hasn &apos;t been asked a million times already .
 yet ,  whenever the question is some variation of  &apos;what &apos;s the sexiest sexual sex you &apos;ve ever sexy sexed sexily ?
  &apos; ,  there it is on the front-page .
  as if r/all isn &apos;t enough porn .
 no backstory allowed ,  but with descriptive titles .
 in the same vein ,  /r/germanhumor
 this is ,  probably ,  my favorite comment of yours as well .
 they published a book of poems .
 you can buy it on amazon .
 the mouse in the manor house .
 you guys think in the shower ?
 i just stand there and exist
 posting there is something only the best(and luckiest) of us can acheive
 i made a shit one about how fanfic was like video game mods but for books .
 got immediately removed because of the word ‘mod’ ,  with a comment saying ‘meta posts are banned’ .
 guessing it immediately assumed i meant moderator .
 it needs to have a rule like r/the10thdentist  &apos;upvote if you disagree &apos; .
 it will probably not be as effective in r/unpopularopinion as it &apos;s a much bigger sub but this way we might have a chance to see some unpopular opinions
 bro ,  i got a new phone and was trying to login on my old account .
 i was so confused when nothing worked .
 i was tired of this and went on reddit to see this .
 at least i know the reason .
 well i work for t-mobile as tech support so my entire day has basically been  &apos; &apos;yeah that &apos;s not us and it &apos;s not your fault &apos; &apos; ,  but seeing a little more activity on reddit is nice .
 with the influx of visitors it &apos;s only a matter of time before reddit servers also go down
 myspace is working fine   :)   just sayin &apos;
 i was wondering why i kept seeing the same 5 posts on facebook lmfao
 didn’t know they were down but that explains why my friend stopped replying all of a sudden… i hope
 for a change it’s not reddit thats down
 didn &apos;t know they were down but that explains why i haven &apos;t heard from my sister yet today .
 as long as i have something to scroll endlessly with ads and strong opinions i feel alive .
 i thought my internet was the problem .
 turns out the universe is just sending me a sign to stop mindlessly scrolling through someone else &apos;s timeline .
 oh ,  i kept trying to refresh my feed on insta and it wouldn &apos;t work .
 welp ,  it &apos;s pretty nice here .
 i thought my wifi was stupid
 i already exhausted all of my usual subs hours before this happened .
 the internet is dead to me .
 hey mom ,  you said i &apos;d never amount to anything .
 well ,  look at me now .
 i &apos;ve been trying to send something funny from reddit via whatsapp .
 this is not good i &apos;m trying to flirt !
 i was wondering why my wife was talking to me more
 i did go to facebook first .
 and now im not .
 i mean the only difference is i was gonna probably dm someone
 i paid my bill thinking it was late lol
 wonder if it has anything to do with the 60 mins whistleblower thing
 suddenly my clients are back to email again and i love it !
 the only thing i use facebook for is giving stuff away .
 so does anyone want a high chair ?
 it &apos;s my birthday today ,  and all the many friends i have posted too many birthday wishes .
 crashed the facebooks .
 the average reddit user hates everything ,  and hopes facebook never comes back .
 i like reddit ,  and i &apos;m browsing through it like crazy ,  but i hope that atleast whatsapp is going to work again in the next lets say 30 minutes .
 what did anonymous finally get around to hacking facebook ?
 what if ,  this is it ?
 the moment facebook ended .
 the great wifi reset happened today
 reddit dies way too often to flex though
 probably most of reddit:  &apos;wait ,  they &apos;re down ?
 i laughed a little when i realized that this is a world wide thing .
 what the guck went wrong ?
 facebook deleted my account a couple months ago without a chance to appeal .
 for all i care ,  they can stay down for good .
 this shows why monopolies are a problem .
 if zuckerberg didn’t own everything ,  only facebook would be down .
 i thought the 4g tower finally turned the frogs gay
 i &apos;m fascinated by what is happening .
  close off channels of international communications .
  spread messages of widespread shortages everywhere to activate the hoarders .
  whistleblower &apos;s testimony causes market instability .
  now a date breach dump exposing wealthy people using tax havens .
 i dumped facebook/insta last year when i realized it added absolutely zero value to anything .
 less misinformation will be spread today .
 it &apos;s down everywhere i guess across the world .
 completely ruined my reddit experience since i use fb messenger to share reddit links with my other half .
 i had to text her .
 like some sort of caveman !
 next the texts will stop working and i’ll have to get out of my chair and walk across the room to show her a reddit post !
 i originally tried to respond to every comment but that’s not gonna happen .
 this is a fantastic way to celebrate my cake day and a nice greeting after my therapy session ,  thanks yall !
 i can &apos;t crop screenshots of memes to people anymore .
  and ,  uh ,  that &apos;s it for now .
 not affected ,  but i did switch reddit to the top - last hour setting to see if reddit is posting about it ,  just to find every other post is from r/superstonk after which i found this post .
 i’m just here to figure out when fb is working again - signed suburban middle aged mom
 a reporter was liveblogging something via ig stories ,  so now she &apos;s just using twitter instead .
 it turned me into a newt !
 i am always on all 3 while i work from home .
 the biggest difference now is i am texting people instead of using messenger .
 honestly ,  it’s making me realize how often i reflexively check facebook .
 that place is a cesspit .
 i feel better knowing i can’t access it
 i’m stuck doing actual work at work instead of browsing instagram .
 this is stupid .
 my guess is that facebook took down their servers on purpose to show us all how much we depend on them ,  and tomorrow they &apos;ll be like  &apos;if you don &apos;t make us rulers of earth right now we &apos;ll take our servers down for good &apos; .
 those nefarious bastards .
 guessing fuckerbot &apos;s motherboard is shorting over the falling stock prices .
 what are the chances this has to do with pandora papers ?
 i have to regularly text my sister rather than use whatsapp ,  which is annoying .
 but reddit is usually more interesting than facebook/instagram anyway so that doesn’t change much .
 not a problem since i don &apos;t use any of those anymore .
 reddit is my go to place
 i can &apos;t be the only one who thought my wifi was just ass
 all i did was try to make my status about epipens incase someone wasn &apos;t familiar with it .
 and it went down  so here &apos;s a refresh or something new to learn  .
 just incase this could help someone: blue to the sky ,  orange in the thigh .
 when using an epipen ,  pull the blue cap straight up ,  removing the cap .
 swing and push the orange tip into the middle of the thigh .
 count ,  one one thousand ,  ect up to 3 .
 you &apos;ll never see the needle ,  and it can be administered through clothing if necassary .
 i didn &apos;t even notice they &apos;re down ,  lol .
 i &apos;m spending my time reading posts here ,  playing on my wii and watching (more like listening to) youtube .
 it &apos;s blissful and i love it .
 what if this was it ?
 the point in time .
 the day facebook goes down and never comes back .
 this is why people at work keep telling me the internet is down because it most certainly is working fine .
 they are all trying to do social media .
 lol didn’t even notice the other sites are down before this question
 didn &apos;t even notice
 wifi on campus has been awful this past week ,  so i assumed it was just that again ,  but i suppose i’m not alone for once .
 currently studying for two exams i’ve got this week .
 feeling really good about it .
 hopefully two easy a’s but we’ll see .
 one is a practical lab on a dissection of a shark and a cat .
 need to know the muscles and skeletal structure .
 hope everyone is having a good day .
 times are whack and stressful ,  but you guys are great ,  so keep doing what you’re doing :)
 by going to r/terriblefacebookmemes ,  you can get the full facebook experience even when it is down .
 but yea i don’t use facebook so…
 you just named 3 things i live happily without .
 however if reddit went down i &apos;d probably go punch the sun .
 i guess i &apos;ll just post my facebook update here since it is down .
  &apos;i &apos;ve learned that one of the side effects to my covid vaccination is that i can gather in pretty safe groups with my vaccinated family .
 it feels weird !
 reddit ,  if anything ,  seems faster
 just like that ,  influencers got fired .
 finally dm’d my crush on ig last night ,  we texted briefly ,  sent something smooth this morning and was waiting anxiously for a response… then ig wasn’t working but everything else was ,  i thought i was going crazy .
 thank god it’s down for everyone i was about to have a panic attack lmao
 my husband ,  bless his heart ,  updated to ios 15 .
 1 overnight and complained that it ‘wreaked the internet’ on his now apparently brick of a phone .
 there’s more than facebook out there sweetie .
 lol your reps shouldn &apos;t be transferring to you then but of course they &apos;ll do it anyways
 i work for apple support over the phone and i &apos;ve been getting a few a calls today too like  &apos;i want to return my iphone because apple has gone too far blocking us from social media  .
 “yeah ,  right - like  all of _facebook_ is broken .
 let me talk to your manager .
 lol i just called into comcast to ask about an actual outage ,  and they’ve got 99 minute wait times .
 i was just thinking about all the stuff the isps are probably getting .
 i can &apos;t believe people call phone service tech support for this .
 we &apos;re trying very hard to make sure that does not happen .
 til myspace still exists
 i think something came up in your hotmail .
 please check it .
 god what i would give to go back to the myspace days .
 tom was our friend and we just left him for the zuckerberg android .
 that’s just how their algorithm has been for the past few years .
 i legit thought their algorithm was just that bad .
 until i opened messenger and realized it wasn’t refreshing .
 anyone else notice it’s a lot of stuff that’s down ,  not just social media .
 i’ve been to like 4 big stores today that have all said their systems are “down” .
 i wonder how many people think that someone else is ignoring them right now .
 i actually made a call today .
 i was dming a girl i met this past weekend on ig when everything went down and i have no way to talk to her lmfao .
 kelly if you see this its meeeeee
 spent a lot of time trying to figure out why the picture my sister whatsapped me wasn’t downloading
 a couple weeks ago my friend sent me a video of a kill shot he made in fortnite .
 i was congratulating him and he stopped replying and i thought he was mad for some reason .
 they found his body two days later .
 i wish this was a joke post .
 and reddit always goes down when i &apos;m reading an actually interesting thread .
 i won &apos;t have to search for porn .
 facebook related apps down ?
 nothing of value was lost
 ya usually when reddit is down i stare at the different status errors that pop up while refreshing the page .
 when fb is down i find out here on reddit .
 also explains why i haven &apos;t heard from your sister yet today .
 never related more
 i use sync so i don &apos;t have ads .
  that explains why i feel dead inside .
 anything to take my mind off of the meaningless tedium of this mortal coil ,  amirite ?
 get any good any farms in the inbox ?
 laughs in apollo
 mercury &apos;s in gatorade or some shit
 yeah haha i can &apos;t stand the users of those other platforms that mindlessly scroll infinitely on their social media ,  i say from halfway down a question on the second page of r/askreddit
 my ancestors fought and died for me to scroll mindlessly .
 sending me a sign to stop mindlessly scrolling through someone else &apos;s timeline .
 this is accurate ,  sad ,  sobering ,  and makes me want to delete multiple apps from my phone .
 my brain: okay enough reddit .
 what’s wrong with fb ?
 i bet instagram is down too .
 let’s try reddit .
 yeah ,  i just took a picture of a flower in my garden and tried to post it .
 thought my phone was being stupid .
 it is at this moment i learned it’s not just my wifi lol
 i thought my school wifi decided not to allow instagram and facebook
 i kept refreshing and connecting and ugh
 just restarted my phone !
 switched off my router and switched it back on again at least 3 times before i realized whatsapp wasnt working
 i &apos;m supposed to be doing social media work on my day off ,  so it sounds like a good day to me !
 time to start drinking .
 just finished youtube .
 no worries ,  pornhub is still up .
  &apos; &apos;we’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products ,  &apos; spokesman andy stone said .
 sounds a lot like the mayor of amity island .
  &apos;we have caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers .
 a lot of their uses get their news from facebook alone so it makes sense they’d pull the plug for the day until the hype dies down .
  &apos; this is what happens if we are shut down &apos; .
 gives the media something to talk to drown out the whistleblower allegations .
 maybe the one you’re flirting decided to ghost you by crashing all of fb to have a reason not to reply .
 or more likely they’re just as frustrated as you that the flirting has been put on hold by technical difficulties .
 hah ,  mine came up and was all like  &apos;whatsapp isn &apos;t working .
 can you fix it ?
 nope ,  sorry hun .
 dear wife i hope you see this timely but i won &apos;t be able to get the kids off school today .
 with love ,  husband
 since the app is down your wife is talking to us less .
  with all these likes i feel like i profited off your wife  :p
 i noticed when it happened because my wife started emailing me to talk… .
 why she didn’t just text ,  i’m not sure lol
 where’d they go ?
 whatsapp is my primary communication so this is getting difficult haha
 what if this is all just a big scheme by big internet provider to get everyone to pay their bills on time for once !
 customers hate him !
 learn how this guy made everyone pay their bills with 1 simple trick .
 lmfao if theres a wifi interruption i immediately assume the same
 oh fuck yeah it does ,  people cant air their dirty money laundering if there is no place to share it
 it &apos;s my birthday today too .
 libra szn ,  bitches .
 popular over here .
 i hate you ,  fuck facebook
 as a small business owner ,  facebook not being up is frustrating .
 many local groups have advertising rules that allow you to post things about your business; today just happens to be that day for many of the groups in my area .
 most of the time it &apos;s monthly ,  so facebook not being up has a negative affect on my business ,  unfortunately .
 yup me to ,  i live internationally so i talk to my family via whatsapp .
 well it still ain &apos;t working .
 if this a data breach we ded .
 narrator: “it did not”
 this broke last night and fb/fb apps were fine .
 plus the stories themselves have been breaking for awhile ,  it’s just that the person who collected all the internal documents revealed her identity .
 it’s probably coincidence .
 haven’t heard of a group (whether internal or external) taking responsibility for breaking facebook as protest .
 a leak and a major user outage within 24 hours isn’t good for their product and stock price so the c-suite ,  board and employees get fucked and lose “money” if they shut it down .
 tbh i hope so lol
 god that would be amazing .
 rest in fucking pieces ,  yee wanker bastards !
 i have a lot of old pictures on my account i would’ve like to save :(
 and the call wait lines for phone carriers are off the walls as well
 reddit just gets mini heart-attacks; these sites are in a coma .
 half and half ,  based on me reading all these comments
 if messenger and whatsapp weren &apos;t down then maybe
 i like to look at my facebook memories right when i wake up .
 it sets the tone for me to hate myself for the rest of the day .
 it’s juicy ,  right ?
 never a dull moment in the age of immediate information .
 hope you’re having a great day !
 my job is all downtime and waiting .
 i didn &apos;t realize using fb messenger on my work computer to talk to my friends was the only thing making it bearable .
 i &apos;m lonely in here today .
 lmfao my mom literally texted me and said she hopes she didn &apos;t get hacked again because her facebook just stopped working
 you’ll get better
 knows it’s down yet keeps automatically trying to refresh
 my work is social media .
 it &apos;s like a snow day .
 loool i see what you mean .
 but one characteristic about humans is their adaptability ,  if whatsapp is down ,  we will find other apps that do the same job ,  heck i think telegram is still working these days
 i had to ask my son which app was my normal message app .
 i never use it  .
 its all messenger or whatsapp usually .
 i hope facebook never comes back up actually .
 the sky already looks a little bluer .
 you are literally on social media posting this comment
 well obviously this is the entire internet
 i only knew because everyone on twitter is losing their shit about it .
 i deactivated my other socials ,  so nothing changed in the way i use reddit .
 so you’re saying if i share those memes to facebook if/when it’s up and running ,  i can get a ton of likes and laugh emojis from all my 45 and older relatives ?
 i was gonna send my sister a video from my security camera of one of my neighbors taking a selfie with my halloween decorations ,  but since i can &apos;t do that i &apos;m telling you instead .
 its pretty funny .
 the family is walking ,  comes around the cars in the driveway ,  they see all the decorations and 1 kid runs off ,  but the rest of the family is looking at everything in wonder .
 then they notice the skeleton standing at the mailbox ,  so the dad pulls out his phone and takes a selfie with it .
 then mom gets back from chasing down the kid who ran off ,  and the dad has her take a picture of him with the mailbox skeleton .
 then they stand for a few minutes and point out the different things they can see .
 you can audibly hear when they spot the zombie head on a pike wearing a pikachu hat .
 it &apos;s not happening much at this point ,  but it takes awhile for us to notice there &apos;s an outage outside of our scope .
 tech support noticed it pretty much immediately when we started getting calls ,  but then we had to confirm ,  get it through the proper channels ,  and notify everyone .
 there was also a pretty heavy delay .
 facebook/etc went down and we didn &apos;t start seeing our first calls about it until 30 minutes or so later - at which point we were unaware there was an issue ,  but suddenly every single call is about the same thing .
 god i need a vacation from the internet i think .
 the constant stream of stupidity is just mind numbingly depressing .
 i also work for apple support ,  but in the mac department ,  and i also got those calls .
 customer asked how long the outage will be…
 wooowwwww slow clap for the people
 i can &apos;t tell you how many times i heard that today in a shop full of grown men
 i assure you ,  it gets worse .
 has traffic here actually increased after facebook being down or is it average ?
 how do y’all prepare for traffic like this ?
 would be a bit ironic if it happened ,  given how many other sites have gotten the reddit hug of death .
 fingers crossed that it doesn &apos;t ,   though .
 for the health of humanity it might not be a bad thing if all social media took a pause
 ive never seen an admin tag before 
 let &apos;s all jump ship back to myspace
 hm… i need to go check my xanga…
 i still have and use @hotmail
 hotmail is down too .
 i just asked jeeves
 jesus i log into facebook a few times a year and the last time i tried to actually read posts instead of friend requests and notifications it wasn &apos;t showing me posts in order .
  i spent like 20 minutes trying to find the setting to turn it back on only to find out it was removed .
 i just wanted to see family/friend life events and any news i missed .
 whatever the fuck that jibberish was .
 it &apos;s annoying af
 and four of those five posts will be ads for mobile games where (a) someone doesn &apos;t understand that +5 is smaller than +500 ( &apos;only 2% of people are smart enough to win !
  &apos;) and (b) look not even remotely like thr game being  &apos;played &apos; in the ad .
 that and weird shit from wish like bondage masks for cats ,  and electric sparrow catching boxes or some shit .
 i forgot i had dozens of people on my friends list cause facebook hid their posts from me .
 imagine that being a “feature .
 i definitely thought that my mom didn &apos;t care that my rose bush has 9 buds on it right now .
 i thought i got blocked
 with your voice ?
 is that a new feature or something ?
 not all heroes wear capes ,  i &apos;m so proud of your bravery
 sending thoughts and prayers 
 i hope you’re okay .
 holy cow that shit &apos;s terrifying
 did you text them first to make sure it was okay to call them ?
 am i the only one who hates texting and loves calls ?
 it is i ,  kelly .
 how &apos;s your toaster ?
 just stay here then ,  and we should be safe .
 world may actually be a slightly better place for a little while .
 like ,  minutes ,  but better is better .
 lots of value is lost ,  whatsapp is basically the standard messaging tool in a lot of countries
 if you talk with her ,  can you please let her know mom needs bread ?
 i have a potato and i love it !
 you &apos;ve avoided ads for too long ,  you &apos;ve become the ad
 don &apos;t drink that particular gatorade !
 had a coworker was freaking out about mercury going renegade .
 haven &apos;t thought of it any other way since
 it’s got what planets crave .
 it’s got electrolytes .
 you are the hero we needed today
 there &apos;s a second  page of ask reddit ?
 well come on man ,  let’s see that flower !
 i cant believe im getting my news from askreddit .
 same here ,  i tried rebooting my phone and everything 
 it &apos;s at this moment i learned the others are down .
 well they might get on that now .
 dude i moved to a all new apartment
 lol same ,  i even downloaded the update i was putting off .
 rolled out of bed to do the social media stuff i should have done last night .
 annnnnndddd fb/ig is down .
 that means we get out of posting today ,  right ?
 that &apos;s not a day off then .
 get yourself some overtime compensation or do that shit on the clock .
 time to start drinking then take a cute walk outside !
 “nothing to see here folks !
 you &apos;re gonna need a bigger boat !
 and just like that ,  pandora’s papers are yesterday’s news .
 you’re saying facebook would take their services down to stifle dissent ?
 they’ve lost hundreds of millions of revenue from ads not being shown ,  all for a 60 minute doc ?
 there’s been worse press around them; in addition ,  their issue is occurring with dns routing to their page .
 they don &apos;t want to show people that .
 they need mindless habitual users to keep up their routine ,  not to demonstrate it &apos;s possible to live without them .
 a lot of very bored people are now wondering why they &apos;re so dependent on those media .
 zuck just panicked and pulled the plug .
 if fb went down forever tomorrow there wouldn &apos;t be that much chaos for that long ,  would there ?
 there &apos;s demand for what fb does ,  not for fb itself ,  and without the difficulty of establishing itself when everyone &apos;s already on some other service ,  a competitor would get off the ground and replace it in three days tops .
 dude ,  fix the whatsapp .
 it &apos;s all your fault
 then you notice it’s not your wife ,  it’s mark zuckerburg in a wig and skirt
 i also am not talking to that guy &apos;s wife .
 we have to go back !
 yeah man i live alone for like 2 years and now all of a sudden i feel alone at home thats fucking weird
 it &apos;s a good idea though hahahaha
 the zuck strikes again
 everyone tunes in netflix to watch social dilemma
 you &apos;ll crash reddit ,  roo !
 libraz4lyfe because we have no other option !
 my birthday too .
 i hate facebook ,  fuck you
 lets all just move to instagram .
 plug your business here .
 if you sell those full size body pillows with anime girls on them you &apos;ll sell out with the degenerates on reddit .
 i live in a country that has no clue on how to text anymore ,  so everything is going via whatsapp instead of sms .
 if it was on purpose it &apos;s actually genius .
 whistle blower comes out ahead of the hearing .
 facebook  &apos;mysteriously &apos; goes down the next day (a monday) .
 and now people who would never of heard of the whistleblower ,  the report ,  or the senate hearing will know about it when they lookup facebook on google to see why it &apos;s down .
 i came to this section of the comments for conspiracies and intrigue and you present me with rational thoughts and reasonable explanations .
 now we all know what you used your cake day wish on
 it’s been a while since that much news was happening at once .
 feels like peak 2020 but without the looming darkness .
 my situation exactly .
 i often say i don &apos;t use facebook ,  but this is a grim reminder that chatting through messenger still counts as a part of that .
  &apos;oh ,  shit ,  i heard everyone on fb got hacked !
 her farmville will be in ruins
 who are you ,  who are so wise in the ways of science ?
 burn her anyway !
 i also saw dolphins in venice
 the social media page can stay down but i really need messenger to communicate with my friends and extended family
 i totally pictured that whole scenario in my head lol 
 i’m shocked so many people even call their providers for this kind of thing .
 i’m the type that sees something like facebook isn’t responding and i shrug and wait a bit .
 wow i can’t imagine calling my cell company because facebook is unavailable
 i absolutely hated when things like this would happen when i worked for a telecom com  to sometimes people would refuse to leave
 much like every other major property on the internet ,  our traffic is noticeably elevated .
 chatting with other friends across the industry it sounds about the same - it &apos;s a bumper crop for everyone who isn &apos;t either facebook or directly dependent on traffic from facebook .
 there’s 40 , 000 people watching r/pan right now compared to 15-20k on an average day
 they have prepared every software they need in neat little boxes that are easy to install on any machine quickly .
 so when the flow comes they &apos;ll automatically knock at amazon or google to get more places to put their little boxes and this can happen in a few minutes .
 they probably have a dormant pool of little places already setup to absorb the sudden rises before they can request more places .
 they keep the videos playing at 140p as usual .
 yeah ,  today is a lesson for everyone who runs a decently sized site in the industry .
 you need robust break-glasses in place for black swan events .
 a site the size of facebook absolutely has those break-glass procedures ,  but evidently the scope of this failure was such that none of those procedures were sufficient for timely recovery .
 some of the best askreddit threads have a whole host of admin replies .
 they’re pretty rare ,  but fun .
 i thought they didn’t tag themselves
 if they reverted it back to the way it was at its height ,  i would in a heartbeat .
 that would be absolutely hilarious .
  greatest comeback since rdj .
 i tried doing that 8yrs ago but couldn’t get enough people to do it .
  somebody email myspace and let them know we’ll go back if they change the site to replicate the 2005 layout .
 oh god ,  we really regressing back to the stone age huh ?
 oh gawwwd ,  my neopets ,  their dead !
 til hotmail isn’t widely used anymore .
 i’ve been using mine since i was 10 !
 still reppin the @msn here
 same ,  i &apos;m never giving it up
 yeah the algorithm doesn &apos;t work right if you leave .
 you just gotta keep scrolling .
 notice how the official reddit app tries to recommend new subs to you .
 it wasn &apos;t showing me posts in order .
 i use fbp ( &apos;fluff buster plus &apos; - facebook buster .
 )  it has a setting to show newsfeeds in chronological order .
  it also has a lot of other settings fb needs .
 this is exactly why i only use the messenger app and only because of family .
 i deleted absolutely everyone else .
 i never go on the actual fb app anymore ,  haven’t been on in quite a few years .
 the fb straw that broke my camel’s back was getting repeated “friend suggestions” for my husband’s ex (their kids were our “mutual friends”) while tryyyyyying to bloody well see actual friends updates !
 i thought mine didn &apos;t care about me being so proud of my sunflowers flowering that i grew from seed .
 i wanna see the roses .
 this reminds me of the time my 12 year old and her best friend got walkies talkies so they could talk instead of texting .
 probably sitting in the shower ,  embracing their knees .
 this thread is trash
 remember the summer of 2016 when everyone was just playing pokemon go ?
 like the whole world just forgot about all their differences and just walked around catching pokemon .
 disregard ,  i already got this guy &apos;s mom her bread
 how fucking dare you .
 there are people that hate potatoes .
 can you explain this ?
 i feel so stupid (i’m also from the ues btw ,  best neighborhood in town !
 there is when you use a pc .
 you were getting and trusting your news from facebook ?
 askreddit is like the #1 news source on reddit .
 any time there &apos;s a major event askreddit has a special thread about it .
 at least everything is up to date now .
  &apos;average test scores the day after the outage were up 10 percent .
 you don &apos;t know the pasta monster ?
 damn ,  i just changed my identity and got another wifi subscription just in case they were throttling me .
 one time the light in my refrigerator went out ,  i didn &apos;t know what to do ,  i just moved .
 same and it feels delightful
  &apos;our beaches are _open_ !
 i’ve actually been reading a book most of the day instead of scrolling facebook and instagram and thinking to myself “why am i not doing this regularly ?
 pull the plug zucc
 if it collapsed ,  aside from communities that are regrouping ,  and the republican media that would scream censorship ,  you probably wouldn &apos;t hear anything about it within a month .
 individual people will find other time occupiers if its other social media or something else they try  &apos;while its down &apos; or to bridge a gap .
 people wont just sit with the 3hrs+ they would use fb and do nothing instead ,  and  &apos;temporary &apos; solutions are the best permanent ones .
 i dropped it years ago for reddit ,  youtube/twitch/netflix/disney+ ,  and getting more into cooking/meal prep .
 others will bike/spin ,  sew etc but fb is hardly the only thing competing for your attention/time .
 but i can &apos;t even if i wanted to !
 this one is new for me !
 i &apos;m in the lucky 10000 today !
 reduced to atoms .
 we can be alone together .
 then i was like ,  let me dm through instagram .
 hopefully some new eyeballs on that doc too .
 even though it &apos;s the 2nd-most viewed doc on netflix ,  it doesn &apos;t feel like the right people have seen it .
 hate facebook ,  i fuck you .
 same evil company ,  different platform .
 if only ,  it &apos;s a live local only thing so reddit isn &apos;t really a great tool for it
 are you in latin america ?
 that part of the world is incapable of surviving without whatsapp and fb ,  although europe is pretty dependent on it to .
 wouldn &apos;t facebook not want people to know about that stuff ?
 the darkness no long looms ,  now it surrounds .
 netflix started lagging when facebook went down so if t mobile is their source of internet they probably thought it was internet when it started .
 welcome to dealing with the general population !
 if you ever work in a call center ,  of any kind ,  you will be amazed by humanity’s collective stupidity and impatience .
 i work support for an av company ,  you have no ideea on why ppl would call
 people call 911 when domino’s forget to put green peppers on their pizza .
 care is swamped .
 what site if you don &apos;t mind me asking ?
 what is the theoretical likelihood that another major site comes down leading to an even larger flood of users moving on other sites that can’t handle them leading to a domino effect where every major site/app is overloaded lol .
 nobody is talking about why this happened ,  including the platforms .
 do you have any intelligence on this ?
 wait ,  /r/pan is still a thing ?
 i honestly assumed it would be about pansexuals
 i thought this was a joke when i started reading it but what a fantastic eli5 of talking about containers ,  orchestration ,  and backup servers/failovers
 the only reason i know some very basic coding was because of myspace
 there &apos;s gotta be an original myspace clone out there somewhere right ?
 it was all accidentally deleted ,  actually .
 apparently the data got all screwed up transferring files to a new server stack .
 tinfoil hat me thinks tom did it to save us from ourselves .
 hmm i had the number for the local dialup bbs here somewhere .
 maybe it’s under this stack of aol floppies i’m saving to upcycle into a messenger bag .
 is that geocities i hear in the distance ?
 i thought everyone had a hotmail account from when they were kids and a g-mail account for adulty stuff .
 i feel like that &apos;s new .
  it keeps recommending me subs my so sends me links for .
  it loves recommending different provinces to me .
  i see you like canada ,  how about some pei posts ?
 i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t notice half of the recommendations though .
 your mistake is using the official reddit app .
 reddit is fun for life
 so many kids just wanting to show off their flowers to their mom
 i actually really care about your sunflowers even if your mom regrets you ,  they sound pretty and i wanna see
 there &apos;s just something about walkie talkies that are different though .
 it &apos;s more fun than just a phone call .
 walking into cars
 can confirm ,  his mom has been bread
 ya &apos;ll have no chill omgg lmao
 hating potatoes is racist .
 it’s got electrolytes .
 it’s what plants crave .
 it &apos;s got electrolytes !
 it &apos;s zodiac or astrological pun ,  something like  &apos;mercury &apos;s in retrograde &apos;
 that &apos;s a nice flower
 this is our facebook now .
 that flower is nice too ,  good work
 i like that flower .
 that’s a nice flower .
 pretty cool flower
 is that a passiflora ?
 that &apos;s a nice flower ,  but you also seem to be growing sea urchins .
 this is not my source of reddit news
 news about fb ,  wa ,  and insta being down .
 and mods just allow it because the rules are pretty ambiguious about it .
 personally i dont mind it .
 i even paid my wi-fi bill early 
 more like down given how rampant cheating is using fb &apos;s messenger and groups
 facebook is just a gossip magazine compared to a real book .
 what do you mean you don &apos;t want to ?
 monke together strong .
 fuck i ,  you hate facebook
 i you ,  hate fuck facebook .
 companies turning evil definitely includes reddit inc .
 bruh i have family in the caribbeans and that &apos;s literally all they use to communicate with someone directly ,  businesses ,  schools ,  etc were all reliant on it .
 i think any country that &apos;s not the us by now is dependent on whatsapp
 yes—the idea would be that those against facebook would be the ones to coordinate the whistleblower report with the service going down .
 yeah ,  i &apos;ve been pondering on a kessler syndrome-like event for websites .
 seems like a fun concept to try and guard against .
 at that point ,  we all go outside and breath fresh air for once
 i &apos;ve only heard similar things to what is floating around the internet ,  and it doesn &apos;t surprise me at all: a bad config change was pushed in such a way that killed bgp peering for fb (which is verifiable - isps and cdns confirmed seeing their routes disappear) .
 facebook uses  &apos;dogfooding &apos; for practically all of their systems ,  where internal company processes rely upon the product and systems they build themselves .
 as such ,  with something as fundamental and catastrophic as bgp peering breaking ,  all of their own internal systems were down ,  so they literally couldn &apos;t get in to fix things .
 you can usually somewhat plan for these kind of events and have break-glass procedures on hand to mitigate ,  but it seems the scope of the bgp breakage was such that they couldn &apos;t get back in under their planned break-glass procedures .
 all of the above is based on some indicators seen in bgp and some anecdotes floating around the internet ,  combined with some educated guessing based on my own experience with systemic failures .
 i never disliked it ,  but i did find it unusual ,  but it grew on me
 honestly at first i thought it would be a subreddit about pans .
 like to cook with .
 i just hopped on reddit and i &apos;m wondering how long before someone makes this an actual eli5 thread to try and karma whore
 the icing on you cake day !
 same ,  and that &apos;s why i loved it so much also .
 i used to spend hours customizing my profile .
 learning to code on myspace is how i now work as a site designer .
 so was @yahoo an awkward phase some people got to skip ?
 i use my hotmail for adulty stuff .
 does this mean i &apos;m actually worse at adulting than i previously thought ?
 yeah if you &apos;re logged in and randomly view a post from a subreddit you &apos;re not subscribed to ?
 welcome to recommendation city ,  population you .
  &apos;i see you like uno .
 you &apos;ll definitely like magic the gathering .
 i &apos;m proud of you both !
 i planted sunflowers and roses this year for the first time ,  and can &apos;t wait to try more next year !
 i do it via text so she replied today :d
 the grown up version on “here mommy i picked you a ” 
  &apos;even if your mom regrets you &apos;  !
 saying  &apos;kshhh over &apos; isnt the same on the phone
 roger dodger what &apos;s our vector victor ?
 this is why i miss nextel ,  beeping my dad on the construction site just to say ,  what &apos;s up !
 walking into homes
 trespassing into yards
 they grow up so fast .
 but what are electrolytes ?
 i like that boulder flower .
 that is a nice boulder flower .
 i read this in donkey &apos;s voice from shrek
 nope ,  toad lily !
 this is not my beautiful wife
 a personalized and customized gossip magazine just for you ,  including custom ads and all .
 creepy as hell .
 what are we going to eat today ?
 i fuck ,  facebook hate you
 you hate ,  i fuck facebook
 yup used to live in colombia ,  i kid you not ,  my dentist would communicate with me for appointments via whatsapp .
 i &apos;m starting to think it &apos;s really unusual that i don &apos;t even know what the whatsapp ui looks like .
 i &apos;ve never used it or installed it on my phone .
 for reference ,  am canadian .
 whistleblower isn &apos;t employed by facebook anymore ,  so that &apos;s be a hell of an accomplishment to pull off a botched dns update .
 it &apos;s yet another reason my businesses run all their web stuff on a physical server near my house .
  it &apos;s self contained and depends on nothing but electricity and an ethernet connection to the internet .
  email is configured to send via amazon &apos;s email service but if that goes down i can still receive and i can switch to local sending by removing a single line of configuration and reloading the server .
 a couple of my websites and apps use maps ,  and those are hosted on my servers too .
  it means i don &apos;t have to pay for usage and i &apos;m not relying on google or whatever .
 whenever there &apos;s been a major internet outage i &apos;ve been unaffected ,  although some of my clients have been unable to load my websites because their isp went down .
 very pretty computer sciency words .
 what song did you have set to play automatically ?
 same here ,  my little emo self just wanted to write decorations all day and here i am .
 man i wish i had kept interest after building the sickest profile ever(biased opinion) .
 i loved the times my friends would call me over to lift someone else &apos;s music player and put it on their page .
 or shrink it to make room for other bs banners .
 i got so lazy i stole parts of people &apos;s codes and modified it .
 after the jump to fb i was done and never looked at it since .
 making music and coding on myspace late 00 &apos;s was the hay day of both sides of my brain .
 all on drugs and alcohol even .
 i had ymail for several years as a teen before i switched to gmail since the spam filter was absolute garbage .
 it was a pain migrating all of my site accounts to a new email address .
 the only reason i got a yahoo account was to follow my programming group .
 then later on ,  much to my disappointment ,  i found that google doesn &apos;t support the underscore in an account name ,  so they basically gave me the digital fuckoff to my username here .
 yeah it’s fucking annoying on my porn account seeing shit from r/all while i’m having personal time .
 i always knew uno was a gateway drug .
 you should try zinnias next year .
 the flowers seem to last forever .
 also i’ve had hummingbirds and monarchs constantly since they started blooming .
 it’s a serious gardener ego boost .
 this is why i love reddit
 listen ,  motherhood is a lifetime of being enthusiastic about someone else &apos;s minor victories and doggedly devoted to cheering them up in their minuscule defeats .
 or regretting that you birthed a sunflower grower when you wanted a rose cultivator .
 these are the rules we are following .
 maybe we should start using phones like that though .
 “overs” and “rogers” .
 might be more fun !
 we have clearance clarence .
 walking off cliffs .
 getting bit by dogs
 they &apos;re what plants crave .
 it’s what plants crave !
 i read a previous comment in donkey &apos;s voice ,  then said the line saying flower .
 every time i hike and see boulder .
 well ,  how did i get here ?
 my god ,  what have i done ?
 this is not my beautiful house !
 this is not my beautiful house
 this is not my beautiful house !
 facebook i hate ,  you fuck
 yep fairly normal for my fam back home  ,  doctors in the family use it regularly where they set up a business account .
 if you &apos;re in the u .
 s it &apos;s not really unusual ,  most of my friends were shocked that i used it to communicate with my family from the caribbeans .
 it &apos;s not really a thing there
 yeah ,  those simple ,  local ,  elegant architectures are always fun to look at ,  especially when they &apos;re rock-solid .
 it &apos;s interesting to think about the possible failure modes ,  like a local major power outage ,  isp outage ,  or natural disaster .
 a convenient factor for those kinds of use cases is that ,  if your next-door colocation facility is under a catastrophic internet failure in a local area ,  then odds are many or all of the local users are also unable to get on the internet .
 being down doesn &apos;t matter much if 90% of your users are down at the same time .
 you mainly need to control for the failures where your users are up but your servers are down .
 save some knowledge for the rest of us
 goddamn that &apos;s smart .
 i hope it &apos;s not just one place ,  you should have at least another distant server in case of localized incident like a fire or a flood .
 then go outside and breath in the fresh water
 my understanding: facebook makes all their own doors into their system ,  and they rolled out an update to their door hardware .
 this was done improperly and made it so certain doors won &apos;t open because the handle is broken .
 normally a couple broken handles isn &apos;t a big problem and they just go in through another door ,  but they can &apos;t find one with a working handle because it was too big a fuck up .
 i am not a network engineer ,  just someone who googled what those words mean ,  so i can &apos;t promise you this is right .
 bgp: border gateway protocol (the door into their network) .
 dogfooding: using your own systems and software built in house
 the real question is did you hide the player so no one could turn it off

 you can turn off the recommendations on mobile by going into settings ,  clicking on your profile and toggling off enable next generation recommendations  .
 i &apos;d like to give credit to the redditor who posted this originally ,  but i don &apos;t remember their name .
 you &apos;re with us in spirit ,  unknown redditor .
 seeing r/kidsarefuckingstupid works well with beating meat ,  doesn &apos;t make me feel weird at all and doesn &apos;t make me lose my boner .
 my moms memo got lost in the mail i suppose .
 fun fact: inventor of the telephone ,  alexander graham bell ,  originally suggested people should answer the phone by saying  &apos;ahoy .
  &apos; it &apos;s only thanks to that jerk thomas edison that we say  &apos;hello .
 check the radar range .
 letting the days go by
 this is the one that gets really worse as you age .
 i facebook you ,  fuck hate
 what is the main app (similar to whatsapp) used in the us ?
 i &apos;m from brazil and everyone uses around here
 unrelated ,  but super fun to see a redshirt geek out with the users down here :)
 i &apos;m cheap/thrifty/frugal too .
  that &apos;s the original reason i started doing everything locally .
  i did the math and realized i was paying more for cloud hosting than 1u of colocation costs .
  one pre-owned dell r610 with some ebay upgrade parts later and i &apos;m my own cloud company !
 don &apos;t worry ,  all the rest of the knowledge is safe in my diy apocalypse computer .
  basically a server ,  router ,  wifi ap ,  gps ,  atomic time server ,  and more ,  all in a 2 foot cube with handles .
  the front folds down to reveal a display ,  keyboard ,  and mouse mounted within .
 i &apos;ve loaded it with offline maps ,  wikipedia ,  and a bunch of other stuff like the debian linux package archive .
  that means it could bootstrap an entire computer lab with blank hard drives ,  giving you a networked room of computers with some important  &apos;online &apos; services .
 this makes it so much better
 myspace ,  we &apos;re never going down .
 thank you for this very specific memory i had locked away deep in my brain .
 neopets was the shit
 yeah ,  my favorite thing to see with my dick in my hand is an abandoned dog being rescued .
 fucking love that shit .
 /s also for the more daft folks on reddit that can’t detect sarcasm .
 that &apos;s just training for having real kids and sneaking in a quickie with the wifey .
 gotta be able to hear the booger eater playing in the other room and fire off a quickie regardless .
 mine did too ,  but my kid gets washed in endless encouragement to be herself and love whatever makes her happy .
 no pressure and disappointment that she is her own person .
 i think the first person who received a phone call froze not knowing what to say to the other and went with  &apos;hello ?
  &apos; and that was it .
 idk about you but i heard this on conan o &apos;briens podcast .
  listening to him and bill hader doing mock old timey characters and making an antiquated booty call is one of the funniest things i &apos;ve ever heard .
 well french say  &apos;allô &apos; which mean nothing and is used exclusively for answering the phone (or any long distance communication devices)
 you had me at  &apos;ahoy .
 and stop calling me shirley
 water flowing underground !
 same as it ever was !
 same as it ever was !
 let the water hold me .
 i hate book ,  facefuck you
 i use the standard android or samsung text message app .
 me pretending i understand their tech talk
 you scared them away
 so much fun going around
 i feel like some government entity just noted your username for future reference in case of apocalypse .
 lionel richie &apos;s  &apos;ahoy ,  is it me you &apos;re looking for &apos; would be more fun to sing .
 there is water at the bottom of the ocean
 into the blue again
 we will see ads with santa wearing a facemask .
 that being said the poor elves took a huge hit from the pandemic so there are less toys to go around this year .
 strictly one per child or 2 between 3
 he &apos;ll send the elves as they are expendable .
 he invented  &apos;contactless delivery &apos;
 clearly santa claus is immune to all disease and does not spread or carry disease from house to house .
 i think it would be a great excuse to get them to go to bed .
 tell them he won &apos;t come unless he knows everyone is shut away in their rooms so he won &apos;t accidentally come within 2m of someone .
 the dude has flying reindeer and can bend time and space to ensure he visits everyone over the course of a single night .
 covid-19 ain &apos;t got shit on santa .
 i &apos;m sorry ,  but santa didn &apos;t survive the pandemic little one .
 santa contracted the virus and is self-isolating in the north pole .
 santa knows how to use a mask ,  and lysols everything so it will be ready to open in the morning .
 now ,  go to bed so he can properly social distance from you little sh\°ts .
 santa took 3 levels in paladin
 leave a bottle of hand gel alongside the mince pie ,  carrot and sherry .
 he &apos;s magic ,  that shit don &apos;t fuck with magic !
 most likely he &apos;s simply using his orbital present launcher to shoot everyone &apos;s gifts across the gulf of space into the appropriate spots in their homes .
 with no thought of the pandemic ,  i was talking to my family yesterday about their plans for thanksgiving and christmas .
 it wasn &apos;t until they said  &apos;well let &apos;s see how the cases look by then &apos; that i got pulled back into reality that the holidays ,  the best time of the year for most people ,  is going to be very lonely and possibly depressing .
 stares in jewish
 santa &apos;s considered an essential worker .
 parents: this is the moment you &apos;ve been waiting for .
  you can remove santa from the picture guilt free .
   &apos;santa unfortunately died of covid along his route and fell into his watery grave in the atlantic ocean .
 the elf on the shelf can finally die
 he’s magic ,  he has flying rain deer and fly through the night and do they believe in santa they’ll believe anything you say about him
 the same way you explain away all the other reasons not to go into other people &apos;s houses
 he &apos;s not real ,  i &apos;m/we &apos;re the ones buying the presents .
 now please ask for cheaper stuff .
 no need to thank me
 doesn &apos;t he touch his nose a lot too ?
 don &apos;t touch your face !
 if wears a mask .
 other than that i expect that the same magic that allows him to visit everyone in such a short time also protects him and prevents him from spreading diseases .
 if kids ask he has experience with regular flue and past disease outbreaks ,  he is quite good at it now .
 all kidding aside ,  i hope this years x-mas decorations show santa wearing a mask .
 is the truth an option here ?
 santa &apos;s beard is anti-microbial ,  vaccine is being developed from his beard extract
 if i have kids ,  i’m not gonna tell them the lie of santa .
 why would i do such a horrendous thing ,  right ?
 well ,  i’m a fairly religious guy ,  so if i lie to my kids about santa ,  what’s to say i’m not lying about jesus ?
 (i am prepared for downvotes now)
 well he will still be able to social distance right .
 his elves make the best ppe .
 it’s rona proof ,  but it only works with that special christmas magic .
 tell them he doesn &apos;t exist .
 pull the bandaid .
 easy: stop lying to your kids !
 sounds like a good time to tell your kids the truth about santa .
 if the kid believes in santa then they &apos;re  already gullible enough to believe any excuse you throw at them .
 so many easy answers: .
 1) santa practices social distancing .
 i mean ,  except for kissing the occasional mommy ,  he usually works alone .
 2) santa is magic; diseases don’t affect him .
 3) santa caught it in april and is all better now .
 there are excellent doctors in the north pole .
 4) santa got the vaccination so he wouldn’t make anyone sick when he visits .
 5) rudolph’s nose emits ultraviolet light ,  so santa gets sanitized each time he gets back in the sleigh .
 crazy answers for “fun” parents: .
 6) santa is already dead .
 he’s been a friendly zombie for centuries .
 7) santa signed a contract with amazon to deliver all his presents this year .
 8) santa is a saint ,  so he can perform miracles .
 miracle makers can’t stay sick .
 9) santa is a robot and robots don’t catch diseases .
 answer for mean ,  realistic ,  or boring parents: .
 10) santa’s not real ,  so he doesn’t get sick .
 this is as good a time as any to tell you we’ve been lying to you about this whole santa thing .
 the world is a dumpster fire and there’s no way in hell any respectable adult would let a strange man into their house to shower their children with presents .
 santa maintains at least 6 feet away from people .
  and what looks like a beard ,  this year is actually a mask .
 he drops the presents into the fireplace (or by windows so if no fireplace ,  open window after puting presents next to tree) so he won &apos;t come in contact with everyone and he &apos;s sorry for that (but he insists on the fact that it &apos;s important everyone does like him if they don &apos;t want virus) .
 also he &apos;s wearing a mask this year and has special snow gloves .
 and his elves are giving him that very rare medecine (chloroquine if you wanna tell them) so it &apos;s less probable that he brings the virus with the presents
 in accordance with worldwide pandemic guidelines ,  santa is now using amazon to deliver presents .
 if covid is still running wild in december i think it is time for you to have some more serious discussions with your kids .
 santa is the least of your worries .
 i mean ,  if you &apos;ve already committed to this lie ,   &apos;he &apos;s magic ,  duh &apos; will suffice .
 the best solution is to stop lying to your kids .
 a masked man coming into your house in the middle of the night to leave you a present from the end of your bed is something i feel like i’ve seen a video of online somewhere .
 i &apos;m honestly tempted to just say we use this to end his reign ,  then lead into the decommercialization of the holiday and turn it back into a time of true merriment and go back to celebrating it in a way more similar to the olden days with merry parties for young and old alike ,  feasting around the table ,  and just a time to put your work down ,  gather with the people you love ,  and simply enjoy yourself in whatever way you please .
 but since we can &apos;t have nice things ,  he has a magic mask that completely protects his entire body from every last particle of the virus that the elves made him .
 krampus will be coming to town this year .
 this is the correct answer .
 why isn’t this higher up lol .
 take your award damnit
 yeah ,  but will he be wearing it the right way ?
 god dammit ,  you &apos;re right .
 and 9 billion ads wishing you a safe holiday
 okay but to be fair ,  they probably could’ve shut down any spread faster and had everyone back to work sooner if santa didn’t force some of them to come in as “essential” .
 the rush to “get back to normal” is what is making it impossible to get back to normal .
 this is what baffles me .
 growing up ,  we got one toy each from santa and the rest were from mom .
 were all your presents from santa ?
 everyone &apos;s replaceable in the business world
 or no presents will be delivered because he &apos;s practicing social distancing and self quarantine like every good little boy and girl should be doing and the lesson learned could be one of the greatest gifts of all .
 they magically get shot down there the chimney and under the tree .
 and if there’s no chimney or it’s blocked well he has magic for that .
 this suggests that santa claus is a paladin  .
 or maybe a high level monk .
  either way i &apos;m going to be imagining santa claus carrying around a holy great sword on his back and wearing plate from now on .
 i mean ,  he is not human .
 why would human disease affect him ?
 clearly santa claus is immune to all disease and does not spread or carry disease from house to house .
 santa claus is a witcher confirmed .
 nasa has prepared a better suit for him
 rockin’ around the christmas tree ,  rocking his new ,  ppe
 santa’s beard acts as a mask
  now someone is gonna patent it and has matel make one as part of the re-edhcation effort .
 out of all the joke replies ,  this is actually a good actual answer
 this might get you in trouble the next year
  tell them he won &apos;t come unless he knows everyone is shut away in their rooms .
 my parents were telling me this 30 years ago even without a pandemic .
 you don &apos;t already do this ?
 dude’s been social distancing forever .
 not to mention ,  he goes into peoples houses while they’re sleeping .
 presumably that means doesn’t get very close to people in the process .
 solid social distancing work by santa .
 i always liked stories where santa is still the same jolly old elf we know and love .
 and is a total badass at the same time .
 dude brings a lump of coal to darkseid every year ,  and never gets hurt one bit for it .
 my family shifted christmas every year to accommodate a travel schedule .
 when strangers asked my mom how she got us to believe in early christmas ,  she said “they believe in flying reindeer ,  this is not much more of a stretch .
 she was right ,  neither i nor my siblings nor classmates had trouble believing in the setup .
 covid will not be the thing that ruins the magic .
 if santa really wanted to he could wipe us all out in a single night .
 this is santa &apos;s world ,  we just live in it .
 what i came to say !
 are we even sure santa is human ?
 the real question is: what the fuck is santa doing to help us right now ?
 that &apos;s how i &apos;m going to explain it verbatim .
 he was 1749 years old and morbidly obese ,  it was just a matter of time .
 old ,  male ,  obese ,  these are high risk factors .
 there’ll be no ho-ho-hovid-19’s this year
 poor families will tell the kids that santa caught covid and died ,  and therefore there will be no presents this year .
 families with money will tell kids that because santa is magical he is immune to viruses .
 this is an answer worthy of 2020
 reindeer flu patient zero .
 he actually got stuck and had to quarantine in the amazon where he’s now just shipping all the gifts .
 instead of milk and cookies leave disinfectant and face masks
 so santa is the one hoarding all the lysol wipes .
 that jolly basted .
 everybody please please please refrain from saying god &apos;s name in vain .
  god has nothing to do with this discussion .
 so shut the fuck up .
 saw you in dndmemes ,  this comment deserves an award
 i had to scroll too far to find this .
 hello from r/dndmemes
 what do yo mean just three levels ?
 he could have easily be level twenty in every class by now .
 newzealand is corona free so no worries
 i ain &apos;t gotta explain shit
 here i am worrying about halloween ,  the vastly superior holiday .
 going door to door to take handfuls of treats doesn &apos;t seem like a good idea ,  although we will be in masks .
 i guess i &apos;ll have to hide behind all my doors and hand my kid treats .
 the holiday spirit usually makes up for the dark and cold outside .
 there &apos;s probably a lot of people that were lonely and depressed during the holidays before the pandemic .
 stares back in muslim
 every winter my parents would remind me not to spoil the santa surprise for all the gentile children .
 them:  &apos;they still believe in santa !
 elementary me:  &apos;but .
 some say you can still see rudolph’s red nose at night .
 it was actually amazon the entire time .
 jeff bezos got so filthy rich by 2022 that he created the first working time machine and traveled back years to deliver packages imitating santa clause .
 no one else could possibly deliver so many packages with a 1 day delivery time .
 no international visitors from the north pole !
 the elf on the shelf got banned because he was committing some pretty massive privacy violations and was probably made in china ,  so he was deemed a national security risk .
 yeah but he might have gotten it from a different house
 makes me wonder ,  fucking scientists were wearing condoms ,  right ?
 by definition you are now santa
  &apos;imaginary people can &apos;t catch diseases ,  billy .
 off to bed ,  now .
 this is the correct answer .
 this is a good opportunity for society to stop lying to kids because it &apos;s  &apos;just fun &apos;
 to be fair ,  he does wear gloves .
 i mean ,  parents are literally almost their entire source of information and unquestioningly trust them ,  they &apos;ll believe anything you tell them if you start lying about it at an early enough age .
 except he’s updated his priors and doesn’t peddle the chloroquine anymore .
 he does keep a spare dose of remdesivir in his sack just in case .
 \this comment removed by hallmark cards ,  inc .
 he existed before the industrial revolution .
 just not very prevalent in america until around then .
 if we murdered santa wal-mart ,  target ,  best buy ,  amazon ,  and the rest of them would invent new folk-lore that is even more commercialized .
 at least santa lore has some charm if you ignore the commercials and shopping madness .
 you mean to tell me that the magical man that knows if you &apos;ve been naughty or nice and delivers gifts to millions of children worldwide in a single night without ever being seen needs any explanation beyond ,   &apos;well honey ,  he has magic to protect him .
 it seems like it would be difficult to wear it properly considering the massive amount of facial hair .
 it’ll be a zoom/facetime style video of random employees talking with cuts to black and white pictures of random people sitting at home in christmas themed pjs ,  empty ice skating rink ,  empty mall santa lines ,  featuring a slow ,  sad-sounding piano version of a christmas song .
 then the narrator has to say ,  “in these uncertain times ,  we’re all in this together .
 we wish you a safe nonspecific ,  winter themed holiday so buy a lexus/nestle water bottle/obscure island timeshare from us because we care .
 maybe if santa had acted sooner to provide cookie and milk rations to all the elves ,  they wouldn &apos;t have been so eager to get back to the toy assembly line .
 everyone knows santa is literally the worst
 when i was younger ,  everything was from santa .
 but ,  my daughter only gets on present from santa and the rest are from me .
 i refuse to let him have all the glory .
 we never actually had any presents from santa .
 i cant remember what my parents told us when we were younger because we definitely believed in santa ,  i think maybe that people would choose and buy the gifts ,  then santa would take them and wrap them for them to be redelivered or something ?
 but all of our presents were clearly labelled with who they were from so we could appreciate and appropriately thank the sender .
 for my kids though they will probably each have a stocking from santa with a few small bits in them .
 my parents were quite boring when it came to celebrating things
 frontline heroes or whatever
 elf-sential ,  you mean .
 as someone else stated above ,  he comes while everyone is sleeping .
 no chance of them spreading it to him .
 he &apos;s fine because he &apos;s been as far from the virus as possible ,  so he won &apos;t be spreading it around .
 this guy doesn &apos;t want to buy presents this year ,  lol
 lesson learned is that family got to meet santa !
 found the guy that gives out toothbrushes on halloween !
 this man is going places .
 not an expensive nursing home ,  but places .
 you sound like a buzz kill .
 but in a year where children have learned all new levels of anxiety ,  do you really want to add ,   &apos;magic is dead .
 santa had to self isolate so he doesn &apos;t die &apos; on top of that ?
 there boring about that stuff .
 they just left it up to me .
 which is the smart move .
 once they forgot to rap a present so they threw it onto the bushes under the roof a week after christmas .
 i’m like omg a gift fell off his sleigh .
 santa punched a heretic irl so yes ,  he &apos;s essentially a paladin .
 he gets advantage on list checks .
 someone please draw this .
 hasn’t he always ?
 dont forget the halberd (r/polearmmasterrace)
 he’s a giant flying mammal and we contracted the disease from a fruit bat .
 can &apos;t we just say  &apos;he &apos;s magic &apos; .
 he does fly through the sky after all .
 the santa clause
 this isn’t– i can’t wear this !
 i’m not ready” .
 “put it on ,  santa .
 i thought norad was the agency assigned to deal with santa ?
 that &apos;s the same comment i read on pornhub ,  lol .
 mask is worn so you can see
 we don &apos;t want to give any other stupid people the idea .
 he wears a mask .
 you should also put hand sanitizer next to the cookies and milk .
  &apos;sorry little billy ,  but santa is in an at-risk demographic with pre-existing conditions .
 if you are an asymptomatic carrier ,  you could unknowingly contaminate santa ,  leading to long term cardiovascular/respiratory damage or even death .
 you &apos;ve only got to stitch together the explanations until they &apos;re ,  at the oldest ,  8 .
 then they &apos;ll ask you the question and you can come clean and induct them into the bittersweet secret society of people who know that santa is just an excuse for the people who love you to get you gifts .
 and now that your hypothetical 8 year old knows the truth ,  you can charge them with the responsibility:  &apos;don &apos;t spoil it for the little kids; it &apos;s so nice for them so just play along .
 it &apos;s not a lie exactly ,  it &apos;s a game &apos;
 and the point stands ,   &apos;go tf to sleep ,  children .
 his immune system must be absolute garbage and he is likely a diabetic 75 year old .
 dude is going down hard .
 you &apos;re asleep ,  you don &apos;t know that he keeps his distance
 the marvel comics santa is the most powerful mutant in existence .
 not only that ,  he &apos;s just a big elf .
 different species ,   not transmissable .
 we did just find out elves are allergic to white chocolate though ,   just like daddy ,   so i know you really like those white chocolate macadamia but cookies you left out for him ,  but they &apos;re poisonous so you &apos;d better pick out a different pack this year .
 santa in dresden files is amazingly powerful and rides with the wild hunt .
 santa is tom bombadil .
 he &apos;s wearing his mask
 my mom was a nurse and used to have to work christmas day every other year .
 since she still wanted to see us open our presents ,  she’d “ask santa to make us the first stop .
 ” so we’d open presents at like 8 pm on christmas eve after we came home from church .
 we totally bought it too .
 my brother decided a few years ago that santa doesn &apos;t fill the stockings ,  mickey mouse does .
 none of us quite know why (he can &apos;t talk) but he basically signed  &apos;knees &apos; when we asked why mickey was helping ,  so now in our house santa does the presents under the tree and mickey mouse goes upstairs to fill the stockings .
 all apparently because santa &apos;s getting on a bit and his knees don &apos;t work like they used to .
 occasionally i mention this to someone and they act like it &apos;s super weird ,  and it &apos;s like ,  dude ,  mickey mouse helping out really isn &apos;t the weirdest part of the story .
 he knows when you are sleeping .
 he knows when you &apos;re awake .
 he knows many ways to end your life ,  so you &apos;d better be good for goodness &apos; sake .
 chimneys behind you .
 nothing personnel kid
 there are rumors and tales about how he was once human ,  but he was long ago twisted by the dark magiks that fuel his empire .
 immortality is bought with a heavy cost .
 he might be a magic elf wizard ,  but his specialty is toys ,  not diseases .
 don &apos;t worry ,  you &apos;ll also get a bar of soap and a small bottle of disinfectant as a bonus christmas gift this year
 with all the cookies he eats ,  i &apos;m guessing diabetic too .
 it is really sad like that .
 i remember a friend stayed with us over christmas when he was 7 ,  and he didn &apos;t understand why santa gave us more .
 i didn &apos;t get what he meant until i came over for the first time .
 christ ,  meryck ,  i am so sorry that that is your situation .
 we had him over for chirstmas every year after that so he could escape his stepdad &apos;s side .
 rockin &apos; around the ppe .
 please stay six feet away .
 everyone &apos;s distanced merrily .
 in the new old fashioned way .
 puts on wishlist lysol wipes .
 i was totally cool with that until you brought religion into it ,  goddammit
 stop trying to police everyone else &apos;s language .
  whatever hangups you have about it are your problem ,  and your problem alone .
 thank you for giving both of us one lol
 yeah ,  but if he was level twenty in every class ,  he &apos;d be a fighter who couldn &apos;t fight ,  a cleric who couldn &apos;t cleric ,  and a wizard who couldn &apos;t wizard .
 overall ,  it would be pretty abserd .
 clearly it was their progressive stance on the easter bunny spending more time with his family that gave nz an unfair advantage .
 stares back in usa
 santa had to get nz citizenship and spend 14 days in quarantine .
 it isn’t the mince you are thinking of .
 my kid keeps asking how santa can watch everyone .
 it &apos;s easier to just say magic
 new year &apos;s is the day with the highest rate of suicides .
 the holiday spirit does not lift people depressed or lonely out of that depression ,  it just highlights it .
 i think this expectation of an occasional day off (which many have to work during anyway) is not a healthy way to react to suicide ,  or depression in general .
 suicide is prevalent during the holiday season .
 my friend killed himself 3 years ago on christmas day .
 stares from on the naughty list
 no no no you have it all wrong ,  we killed jesus ,  not santa !
 are you trying to start the next hitler cause that’s how you start the next hitler
 and i went to catholic school .
 i felt like some kind of sleeper agent .
 i grew up knowing maybe 3 or 4 jewish kids so it wasn’t ever brought up .
 now i live in a predominantly jewish area where the county even has schools closed on high holidays .
 oh and it’s south florida i have no idea how to explain santa to them down here .
 my dads side is christian ,  not super religious but they celebrate easter and christmas .
 we usually celebrate christmas with them .
 i can’t really remember much from when i was little so i don’t know if my mom told us every year but i specifically remember one year when i was 8 my mom stressing us to keep the santa secret under wraps for our cousins .
 i put on such a good act i actually started believing he was real and i think i cried when my brother broke the news to me .
 and that was the week i ,  a jew ,  believed in santa .
 before it slowly fades away as rudolph dies from depression .
 santa was the only living thing that ever loved him ,  all the other reindeer hate him again because his glowing fucking wart of a nose serves no purpose again .
 the bullying yells of the others get to rudolph ,  so he flies away to where santa was last seen ,  and drowns himself to die where santa lies .
 or a drinking problem
 that &apos;s not any better .
 gloves don &apos;t prevent anything unless they &apos;re used properly .
 i &apos;ve never understood the appeal of lying about santa ,  but what do i know ?
 not to mention ,  immortal .
 he also knows who’s positive and negative .
 he visits the negative people first then he does all the positives .
  &apos;momma ,  why didnt santa share his magic to save grandma ?
 and for the really little ones ,  they won &apos;t even care because they have no clue what &apos;s going on in the world ,  anyway .
 i &apos;ve had my beard for years and i had to shave it ,  wearing a mask with no beard is a completely different and more comfortable experience than wearing it with a beard .
 or at least that &apos;s what i tell myself as i cry myself to sleep every night for not feeling the gentle caress of my beard hairs against my pillow .
 i miss my beard .
 i more meant actually covering mouth and nose .
 the number of people i see who think a mask only needs to cover their mouth  or just has to be on their face to beat the mask requirements is too damn high .
  &apos;in hindsight ,  yes .
 yes ,  of course we should have used your elf hats like plague masks .
 of course the bell would &apos;ve alerted us to disinfect every time you sneezed .
 of course we should &apos;ve had humming instead of singing ,  and worked back to back .
 burning down the workshop won &apos;t bring back wrinklenose !
 or gharakh the devourer ,  which means the diversity internship board is going to be all over us after boxing day .
 face facts: if we don &apos;t get some presents out the door then our supply of letters next year will drop and then r&d goes up and that means fewer ,  more predictable presents ,  which brings down the letters .
 it &apos;s a death spiral .
 so you can make toys now or we can all lose our jobs next year .
 it &apos;s your choice ,  you little f- you little fey folk &apos;
 christmas stories will be lit this year .
  kids gonna get woke
 0 is unlikely ,  but 60 , 000 a day in one country seems unnecessary .
 the sweet spot is probably somewhere a lot closer to 0 than 60 , 000 ,  at which point (especially with a vaccine) it will be a lot safer to behave as though there is no risk
 depends what you mean by  &apos;getting back to normal &apos; .
  will covid cases ever drop to 0 like before it existed ?
  will western culture go back to thinking it odd for a person with a respiratory illness to wear a mask ?
  will we ever be able to have public ,  personal ,  social contact again ?
  of course we will .
  humans are social by nature .
  for the sake of fighting the virus ,  we &apos;re actively behaving against that nature ,  but for better or worse ,  as time goes on people will go back to being social .
  keep in mind ,  its only been 6 or 7 months ,  9 if you &apos;re from wuhan .
  only 3/4ths of a year at maximum .
 for reference ,  consider the black plague wiped out entire cities and was a constant danger every other year for decades .
  that &apos;s a nigh apocalyptic worst-case scenario there ,  and societies still eventually settled down .
 i think we will .
 after a vaccine is widespread and widely used .
 i think cleaning protocols will stay in place though as well as most shops will retain their barriers between customers and cashiers .
 the only thing that will go back to normal is not wearing masks and no more lines on floors .
 also less greeters at doors and no numbers for people to come in .
 a lot of services will probably still be kept in place .
 pickup from your car is just easier and faster .
 i refuse to let him have all the glory .
  the very best presents are always from mom & dad !
 santa can suck it .
 in my family ,  santa is grandma & grandpa and 60% of your gifts are from santa .
 i caught them when i was really young so i got promoted to “big kid” at like 7 and got to stay up and help wrap .
 but as i got older ,  i learned how easy my family made it to figure out ,  my gramps always slips up and says stuff like “i knew you would like that !
 this is also what happens in my house now ,  despite always getting all our gifts from santa when i was a kid .
 same reasoning too ,  why should he get all the glory ?
 that &apos;s really interesting ,  that &apos;s a tradition i haven &apos;t heard before !
 how did you feel about it when you were kids ?
 i love the stocking idea ,  i kind if wish more families let the expensive presents be from family members ,  so the poor kids don &apos;t have to wonder why santa likes the other kid more .
 essentially expendable heroes
 spoken like a true member of the board of directors .
 this year i &apos;ll be leaving milk ,  cookies ,  and hand sanitizer
 in germany santa comes on the evening of the 24th .
 it depends on the family if he comes after church and dinner or if he comes while the family is at the church and the dad has to cook .
 so it might get a bit difficult in germany and any country that celebrates christmas that way .
 but what about saying that as santa is able to deliver all the presents to all the children in just 24 hours ,  he has to be magical and therefore he can &apos;t get sick so the virus won &apos;t harm him .
 and let &apos;s get real here .
 we &apos;re talking about a guy who manages to make a toy for every single child on the planet .
 proceeds to delivery said toys across the globe within 24hrs by flying in a sledge pulled by fucking magical reindeer !
 i don &apos;t think santa needs to worry about a virus .
 i mean that &apos;s not exactly how the virus works even though that is the messaging that everyone has been told .
 he could very much still get it if there are virus droplets still hanging in the air or if he touches something (like a glass of milk) that has it and then touches his mouth (like a glass of milk)
 isn &apos;t punching more like monk territory ?
 my favourite religion related story ngl
 no ,  he &apos;s gotta be a cleric; saint nicholas ?
 patron saint of prostitutes ,  sailors ,  and children (ie ,  three groups of people who are often unable to protect themselves from others) .
 this is the nerdiest joke i &apos;ve heard all day .
 i would not put money on him being a mammal .
 i wish i could make a gif .
 i’d have the suit being blasted with fire but have the flames be green and say ‘covid’ .
 sounds about right !
 love a guy who has lived for centuries calls tony stark “ mr stark”
 deck the halls with handrub bottles
 i want to believe .
 shaved off my beard in march and i miss it greatly .
 i &apos;ve already seen one covidiot push his beard over his mouth to cover a cough .
  cough into your elbows .
  (disclaimer/confession - at 68 almost 69 ,  i &apos;m no longer flexible enough to get my mouth close enough to my elbow to block a sneeze effectively ,  so i &apos;m just wearing my mask instead .
 tip:  i haven &apos;t been shaving daily during shelter-in-place ,  but when i go out and need to wear a disposable mask ,  i need to shave first because a 2-day old stubble shreds the heck out of the back-side of disposable masks and then i have the shredded fiber fuzzies tickling my face behind the mask !
 little billy then wets the bed because he &apos;s too scared to leave his room to use the bathroom
 this is my favorite comment in here lol
 santa definitely has diabetes .
  &apos;would that mean i get to be santa then ?
  &apos; billy said ,  trying not to sound to excited .
  &apos;don &apos;t spoil it for the little kids; it &apos;s so nice for them so just play along .
 it &apos;s not a lie exactly ,  it &apos;s a game &apos; .
 man ,  fuck those kids .
 around 2nd grade kids start learning it and telling everyone ,  thinking they’re cool .
 and you just kinda keep it in the back of your mind; you know santa isn’t real but you can’t come to terms with it .
 i remember in 3rd grade it was considered “cool” to say you don’t believe in santa anymore .
 even as an adult i &apos;m having a hard time internalizing  &apos;it &apos;s not a lie ,  it &apos;s a game &apos; .
 i feel like a child might start playing  &apos;games &apos; after that explanation .
 this is all well and good until you &apos;re 8 year old winks when saying santa is coming .
 god i love my cousin but damn she &apos;s not any good at lying
 my dad dressed up like santa every year when i was little (i never questioned why santa was black) and i truly believed santa would come spend christmas morning with my family because he was  &apos;my mom &apos;s friend &apos; and my dad  &apos;was giving the sleigh a tune up for him &apos; .
  when i was 7 my asshole sister who was 11 ,  took me into my parents bedroom 2 days before christmas and showed me the suit under their bed and the  &apos;love santa &apos; gifts in the closet .
  she told me they lied to me because i was stupid and they would all laugh together because i believed them .
 then she hit me me with  &apos;when have you ever seen a black santa besides here ?
  i was devastated and i felt so stupid .
  i stopped trusting my family because i thought they hated me or something for playing this trick on me .
 i never brought it up but i &apos;ve hated christmas since then .
 i &apos;m in my 30s and i still hate her .
  just a fucking cruel thing to do to a kid .
 santa is about 1 , 750 years old .
 he has seen a lot of pandemics i think he &apos;ll ride this one out ok .
 elves are riddled with diseases ,  most unknown to humanity .
  his immune system &apos;s just fine .
 and a mostly snow- and ice-based diet rivals the mediterranean in health benefits .
  he only has the cookies and milk one night a year .
 idk that coca cola version of santa where he and his polar bear friend both wear sunglasses while they jet off in a 1950s corvette style sleigh seems like he could give him a run for his money .
 the power of santa mixed with the oozing sexuality of elvis is just too much for this world to handle
 just imagine if they did a santa/deadpool crossover; santapool would annihilate all of existence !
 macadamia butt cookie
 pretty sure santa is odin in this realm .
 magic always comes with a price !
 well hopefully an elf helps him get facebook soon so he can become a disease specialist .
 gotta get those elves started on making a vaccine .
 if they can pump out licensed toys and electronics and cars without getting the pants sued off of them ,  they can probably make a vaccine .
 don &apos;t forget about the stds from the easter bunny and the tooth fairy .
 you demorats want there to be more coronavirus deaths ,  if santa got hit by a car while he had covid you would mark it up as a covid death .
 sure ,  santa had covid but he was going to die anyway .
 /s ,  just to be safe .
 i’m told that’s a very real thing .
 my family didn’t do the santa thing when i was a kid ,  but my husband is really into it for our kids .
 i’ve had friends say (not directly to us but in general) that it would be easier if parents would make a cheap gift the “santa gift” and the expensive ,  big gifts like the bicycles and play stations from mom and dad .
 that way ,  kids from poorer families don’t wonder why santa got them less .
 really made me think .
 we usually only give the kids one gift from santa but i never specifically paid attention to things like that before ,  so now i do .
 goddamnit ,  now that fucking song is stuck in my head for the umpteenth time .
 take your fucking upvote ,  asshole !
 picturing kevin in home alone wearing a mask while setting up his booby traps .
 amazing ,  but now i have that stuck in my head .
 i have no money but here &apos;s some gold .
 he &apos;s okay with fuck but not goddammit .
 ah yes a man of culture to !
 my kid asked me that this morning !
 i knew he was planning something so i said magic lol
 damn it ,  i just wanted to be loved .
 no ,  just like every good jewish new yorker knows ,  they hired italians to do it for them .
 did the school want a jewish jesus to nail to a cross for the christmas play ?
 never did get to play games ,  like monopoly .
 we left out beer instead of milk at my house .
 he &apos;s not immortal .
  just whoever kills him and takes his suit receives the old santa &apos;s powers and responsibilities .
 it &apos;s on the card .
 a friend of mine has been growing his for most of his adult life ,  over 20 years .
 he slicks it together in a braid or mini ponytail type thing and tucks it away .
 he had to get masks that were a bit bigger ,  or the neck wrap kind .
 hope you can grow it back soon !
 i &apos;ve had my beard for years and i had to shave it ,  wearing a mask with no beard is a completely different and more comfortable experience than wearing it with a beard .
 or at least that &apos;s what i tell myself as i cry myself to sleep every night for not feeling the gentle caress of my beard hairs against my pillow .
 i miss my beard .
 give this man an award .
 he &apos;s already in enough pain .
 i was just starting to grow mine longer .
 had just gotten to the longest guard on my razor .
 one day it &apos;ll grow back ,  friend .
 i have to shave mine for an ultrasound .
 if the persistent lump is a recurrent lymphoma i’ll lose the beard i grew to celebrate recovering from cancer to chemo :(
 that &apos;s why i just fold a bandana in half and tie it around my head .
 it &apos;s two layers ,  i can tuck the bottom tip into the collar of my shirt ,  and it covers my whole nose ,  face ,  and beard .
 plus it looks cooler than a mask .
 and there &apos;s no way in hell that i &apos;m shaving my beard .
 my head would look like a testicle .
 already went through that when i went through chemo .
 i too trimmed off many inches in favor of a 1/2 &apos; beard because of a mask .
 i forgot what shape my face was .
 i think the metaphor has gone too deep
 rip gharakh the devourer ,  you will be missed .
 the reindeers telling everyone ,  that it wasn &apos;t that bad ,  didn &apos;t help either .
 just because it hasn &apos;t reached the stables yet ,  doesn &apos;t mean ,  they &apos;re safe forever .
 im starting to think we arent talking about santa anymore .
 this is trying way too hard to be funny ,  but to be fair it is really funny so i forgive you .
 i like the take that santa at least at some point had an elf named gharakh the devourer .
 measles is far more contagious and we basically eradicated that from the us and europe with widespread vaccination .
 it &apos;s only coming back in small pockets because of  f̶u̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶d̶i̶o̶t̶s̶ antivaxxers .
 if we vaccinate as heavily for this i believe we could get rid of it in one generation ,  but i fear too many people won &apos;t get the vaccine due to micro chipping paranoia .
 i want the masks to stay .
 got so many pretty ones ,  and it seems like a waste
 unfortunately i have gotten stuck with santa giving the best presents .
 she will ask for something a little pricey ,  to which i would say  &apos;what do you think i &apos;m made out of &apos; and she will reply ,   &apos;well the elves make everything so santa gets it for free &apos; :( cant argue with that i suppose .
 honestly it never crossed my mind as a kid ?
 we were never dissapointed with whatever we got and i think in our house christmas was more about the family anyway rather than what santa did or didn &apos;t bring us .
 it was nice ,  although somewhat boring after a while ,  which is why i would like to bring a little more magic to the celebration for my own kids
 that is a sad phrase .
 you guys have hand sanitizers ?
 left a mask for the tooth fairy last night
  corona virus started last oct/november .
  so how are we going to keep the kids from asking if santa is the og super-spreader .
 as an american ,  i grew up with a family that got up especially early on christmas day to celebrate .
  my wife &apos;s father was german ,  and her family celebrated until the wee hours on christmas eve night .
  we had to celebrate with both ,  in the interest of family diplomacy .
 i had many christmas mornings wishing that santa had brought me a double espresso .
 in my family ,  the christkind rings a bell when we &apos;re allowed into the living room .
 i &apos;m sure an additional wait to allow it 2 meter distance would work .
 i just posted a similar response but i wasn &apos;t sure if it was just a norwegian thing since i live in norway or if it was also a german thing since my family is half german we never went to church ,  but santa usually came around the time we were done eating or when we had just started opening gifts oor kinda in between eating and opening gifts when we were just talking (and as kids we just sat there ,  impatiently waiting for santa and to be allowed to open gifts)
 with global warming and the melting ice cap at the north pole ,  santa had to pick up stakes and move christmas village to germany .
  he doesn &apos;t know just about who &apos;s been bad or good ,  he also knows which countries have dealt properly with covid and which ones were naughty .
  germany was near the top of the list for good countries .
  besides ,  germany is renowned for its toy makers and he figured some of the elves could use a fresh perspective and a few pointers .
  santa continues to take precautions of course .
  you don &apos;t get to be a couple of thousand years old without knowing how to do things safely .
  not just for good little boys and girls ,  for everyone .
 \- every single 3+ year old
 the speed he goes any virus would be burned off between houses anyway .
 he definitely has the agelessness of a d&d monk ,  but he also seems quite good with exotic animals (flying reindeer) and can navigate the world unerringly .
 a paladin punching someone is reasonable too
 paladins are more stabby .
 as long as you punch with devotion then it &apos;s paladin territory too .
 whoa where’s this story from
 skill check ,  i think it’s either perception or investigation
 definitely a bird .
 just mix ethanol with boric acid it should be green
  &apos;macedonian dominates young boy ,  and everything else .
 gay anal ,  most likely
 anything with 300 guys and a hunch back .
 definitely rough guy on guy stuff .
 the spartans were notoriously gay ,  they believed male on male relationships between soldiers strengthened their bond and made them fight harder .
 which it probably did ,  but that &apos;s not definitive .
 this dude raises kids
 i almost did that once when i was tiny .
 mum told me santa wouldn &apos;t come if i was awake .
 i was scared to see santa so i wouldn &apos;t go to the toilet .
 it was 7pm in case you were wondering
 that &apos;s an acceptable trade .
 just have billy sleep in the garage .
 i tried to convince my parents i totally still believed in santa until i was 13 because i liked opening presents at 6am on christmas morning after we opened the rest on christmas eve lmao
 my parents always said ,  “if you don’t believe in santa ,  he won’t bring you anything .
 i got gifts from santa until i moved out at 21 haha
 i don &apos;t know what makes that bad ?
 family traditions are a lot like games .
 we play pretend together all the time; santa is just an example of that .
 feel like if the bubonic plague couldn &apos;t get him ,  covid sure won &apos;t .
 are we 100% he doesn &apos;t cause this every so often in order to lighten his workload ?
 it all makes sense now !
  &apos;look at you beaming away like you &apos;re father christmas !
  &apos;  &apos;who says i &apos;m not ?
 red bicycle when you were seven .
 there’s a group of daleks searching the house and you just see this obese elderly man dressed in red pajamas jump out from behind a door and bolt it to the door with a sack on his back
 “red bicycle when you were six .
 -tenth doctor to rose tyler ,  new who season 2 .
 ten pretty much confirmed that he does ,  at least on some occasions ,  moonlight as santa .
 well ,  his bag would have to be bigger on the inside to carry all those presents - so ,  yeah ,  works for me .
 yeah ,  but on that one night he has like a billion cookies .
 that kind of binge eating can’t be good .
 the power of santa mixed with the oozing sexuality of elvis is just too much for this world to handle .
 i read the  &apos;jet &apos; word as jerk and now there &apos;s a very disturbing image in my head
 elvis is the next step ,  that &apos;s why it &apos;s called elvislution
 as long as it &apos;s not just dead santa floating face down in a pool .
  that would be some christmas at bernie &apos;s shit .
 the santa vs lobo (lobo paramilitary christmas special i think) crossover is probably pretty darn close to what you are hoping for .
 he is donnar vadderung ,  kringle ,  santa claus ,  and odin .
 he is a god level wild fae .
 the north pole is under no one &apos;s jurisdiction ,  so they can &apos;t sue him or the elves .
 the un would have to enact enforceable copyright/trademark laws in order to bring down the big red machine .
 wait did i miss a memo ?
 he only came once a year and it was always down a chimney .
 that &apos;s how it was for me growing up .
  i quickly realized santa wasn &apos;t real because of the gift disparity between me and my friends .
  they always got more than me ,  and one guy we all know ,  who was always a jerk ,  got enough gifts to make dudley dursley even question things .
 and wiping them down with disinfectant afterwards .
 laughs in bolsonaro
 every redditor be like
 you should have seen the bloodlust in their eyes after they figured out i was queer ,  too .
 and i laughed a little too hard at this .
 amazing story telling !
 after throwing santa off a roof ,  and a man named tim allen took over .
 pretty sure he’s still eating sugar cookies and banging mrs .
 you really earned your username
 username checks out .
 that sounds awesome !
 can i get a pic of one ?
 you &apos;re a god damn saint .
 we need more people like you .
 where do i sign up for the beard covering masks ?
 my beard would totally thank you if you have an extra one available
 i &apos;m having a bad day ,  and this just cheered the hell out of me .
 in case you haven &apos;t found it yet ,  r/momforaminute seems like the perfect place for a wonderful person like you .
 i like when the metaphor goes so deep it makes me a little uncomfortable .
 you can &apos;t just use devourer with a hard r like that man .
 read the current climate .
 you &apos;re allowed to wear masks whenever you want you know .
 i definitely think masks should be widely adopted or even required at events with a bunch of people .
 people always joke about  &apos;con flu &apos; when going to big conferences .
 maybe masks would help that .
 the masks will stay in some areas ,  but they &apos;ll be a fashion choice .
 in 5 years most people will have gotten the vaccine .
 workplaces will demand it ,  conservatives will bitch about their rights ,  and workplaces will say  &apos;you &apos;re free to find a different employer &apos;
 extra labour for one gift means less time for elves to make other gifts .
 that &apos;s why if you get something expensive ,  you get fewer gifts .
 pretty sure the elves unionized years ago ,  and now santa pays too .
 or delivery charges .
 reindeer don &apos;t work for free anymore .
 yeah ,  wasn &apos;t hard to find .
  clorox wipes on the other hand .
 because he knows when you are sleeping ,  he knows when you &apos;re awake ,  he knows if you have covid ,  he knows if you think its fake .
 dude don &apos;t say this too much or next thing you know trump is going to start talking about how it &apos;s all china &apos;s fault and santa is a ccp sympathizer who spread it all around the world to destabilize countries and jeopardize his re-election .
 immunity to disease ,  good with animals ,  friends with elves .
 he &apos;s an oath of the ancients paladin / shepherd druid .
 monk/paladin is already incredibly cursed with madness ,  forget ranger .
 take animal handling with a background pick instead .
 santa is a member of the fey .
 magical creatures such as the fey don &apos;t get sick; just don &apos;t make a deal with them .
 true ,  it &apos;s not totally outside paladin jurisdiction .
 let’s remember jesus flipped tables and chased moneylenders around with a whip
 in the council of nicaea (an important religious council) st nicolas punched a heretic called arius
 investigation is fine details .
 he &apos;d likely be proficient in insight as well ,  telling if someone is naughty or nice .
 birds aren &apos;t real .
 santa isn &apos;t real !
  &apos;three nights in helen &apos;
 you misspelled garbage
 i got presents from santa until my mom passed away .
 it was just a family joke at that point ,  but santa always brought the  &apos;big &apos; present .
 my dad had a similar method .
 i remember him saying  &apos;no kid ,  it &apos;s not an actual bearded dude flying around ,  but the spirit of christmas embodied into a legend .
 now that you &apos;re in the know ,  it &apos;s up to you to help maintain that spirit &apos;
 this is fucking amazing
 santa secret society
 if you don’t want to read through the 30 paragraphs of bullshit in that article: .
 tell your kids they’re old enough and mature enough now to be a santa themselves .
 tell them how being a santa is all about giving gifts to others without them knowing who gave them the gift ,  because it’s a selfless nice thing to do to others .
 let your kids find out the ideal gift for one of their friends/neighbors ,  wrap it up ,  and give it out as a christmas gift from “santa” themselves .
 it’s a great idea and a great way to teach your kids the concept of gift giving .
 i read this too and thought it was the best idea ever .
 if he did he &apos;s not a very good .
 he targeted the wrong demographic ,  now he just has less older people to buy the cookies to leave out for him !
 holy shit ,  i remember this line now but i don &apos;t remember which episode it was .
 extermin- what the ?
 all the while ,  he &apos;s pointing this little thing around the house that has a light on the front and makes a high pitch buzzing sound .
 and it was the ninth doctor .
 well ,  on that one occasion ,  anyway .
 having a time machine means he could have ad-libbed that on the spot and just gone back later to make it true .
 what a great episode !
 i watched dr who when i was really young ,  and was recently re-introduced to it by my daughter & we watched the 10th doctor series together ,  over the last year .
 (right after we binged the entire  &apos;good omens &apos; series) .
  i can &apos;t imagine liking any other doctor as much as the 10th ,  but i am going to try .
 i will share this thread with her .
 she &apos;ll enjoy it .
 thanks for the reference .
 who fans are such an interesting and entertaining bunch .
 an animal with a nose that gl .
 oh god ,  rudolph was k-9 !
 he &apos;s a unique being that only needs to eat once a year .
 that night ,  however ,  is a disgusting display of gorging .
 in the year 2020 this will be the new brand for santa unless we put a stop to it before it catches on .
 are you going to be the one to tell him he can &apos;t jerk off in a 1950 &apos;s corvette-style sleigh with this polar bear friend ?
 thr deadpool christmas special .
  santa and deadpool are fighting something from outside our universe .
  they are supposed to combo move at the right time to beat it .
  deadpool fucks up and santa gets sucked into the other universe .
  santa curses/transfers his powers to deadpool to save christmas and then get him back afterwards .
  deadpool has to take on santas role and gets the job done ,  but really sucks at it .
  deadpool enlists his  &apos;team &apos; to be his elves and help him because he &apos;s in so far over his head .
 futurama was right .
 santa is unstoppable
 i mean ,  we knew the tooth fairy was a ho .
 but the easter bunny ?
 not everyone have a chimney on their house .
 what does santa do when there &apos;s no chimney ?
 #he comes through the toilet bowl just like snakes and rats !
 wow this is the most upvotes i ever got .
 edit2: wow 100+ upvotes and my very first badge !
 super thx dudes !
 thx for the badge camper-ific
 very depressing that reading through there proved you right .
 i thought it was actually someone who believed that .
 fill me with your downvotes people !
 actually ,  thats just my hard exterior talking .
 deep down ,  i truly desire love from random people on the internet
 claus not change ?
 is it the same woman the whole time with these different random dudes every few decades ?
 there was a few more documentaries about how tim settled into his role as santa ,  didn &apos;t see them all .
 as far as i know tim &apos;s still at the north pole .
 i read it as momo fevery one 5 .
 why is momo getting all fever-y .
 yep ,  i &apos;ve been taking care of kids since i started teaching swim lessons in high school maaaany years ago lol
 you &apos;re welcome ,  now go wash your hands and try to eat your vegetables hon !
 idk about all that but thank you !
 lol i &apos;ll pm you .
 i &apos;m pm you ,  give me 5
 lol glad to hear it !
 i hope your day gets better ,  and if it doesn &apos;t and you need to talk just pm me .
 i &apos;m around most days !
 that &apos;s what she said .
 yes tp and hand sanitizer is all stocked where i am but i can never get a goddamn bottle of multipurpose disinfectant spray .
 every cleaner except like the specific shower foam or floor wax is always gone and i don &apos;t want to have to ration my spray when my dog pisses on the floor
 i can find a ton of hand sanitizer but not one damn type of clorox wipes .
  and i can actually find toilet paper it’s quite shocking
 from what i hear the makers of clorox wipes dropped production down and switched a lot of their machines to producing ppe for front line workers .
 so clorox wipes are going to be hard to come by for a while .
 santa leaves masks and coal for those who refuse to wear them
 bruh have you seen how much red he fucking wears ?
 even his lead reindeer is a fucking commie .
 presents for everyone that toes the line ?
 he &apos;s always been a god damn marxist .
 summon greater steed works for just paladin .
 he &apos;s just a big jolly high level paladin .
 u/moonpenny that &apos;s what i was thinking .
 wouldn &apos;t accepting presents from him invoke some kind of non-written contract ?
 i think we already do by letting him in our homes .
 ha ,  i have to say ,  important religious council feels like an understatement .
 but that aside ,  what &apos;s a good party with a brawl ?
 had to look this one up from the u .
 (hovid germisep is a disinfectant tablet is produced with pharmaceutical standards)   .
 lemme try:  &apos;ho-ho-purell &apos;
 paris watches like a cuck
  &apos;giant hole gangbanged by men and woman &apos;
  &apos;give them nothing .
 but take from them everything !
 fantastic ,  allons y ,  geronimo ,  shut up
 i &apos;m pretty sure it was the episode with the gas mask kid .
 “just need to use the sonic screwdriver to locate some more biscuits guys ,  won’t be a minute”
 who looks at a screwdriver and thinks ,  “ooh ,  this could be a little more sonic .
 wrong ,  he breaks the wall like kool aid man
 i gave you a downvote and then an upvote to make it better .
 i’ve brought this up so many times and i get to do it again .
 after the death of a mr clause she needs to be removed from the position .
 of course she knows all about what’s going on in the north pole so the elves will sacrifice her to keep their operation a secret .
 that’s the main reason why the head elf sounded so depressed after the new santa was made and why he waited to tell him about needing to marry until the last possible moment .
 he did not want to go through that shit again so soon if the new santa failed
 i think the new santa sacrifices her and puts her in the grave with the old santa ,  his chief elves as well .
  i can’t remember about his favorite reindeer ,  but it’s not out of question .
 it’s an ancient tradition .
 i laughed too much at this comment
 i feel like a ferry ,  or at least pre-pandemic me felt like that lol !
 edit- i can &apos;t read either !
 i think i need some coffee
 he drank the cactus juice .
 it’s the quenchiest !
 at first glance i saw mofo .
 too many leechy nuts .
 i don &apos;t wanna eat my veggies !
 you ,  my dear ,  are awesome !
 awh you just made me miss my mom from this comment .
 i’m gonna call her
 i &apos;m a woman with no beard ,  so i have no need of these .
 i just want to say you rock .
 spray bottle of bleach diluted in water ,  i think it’s 15 parts water to 1 part bleach ?
 as a grocery store employee ,  it is most likely they stopped selling the disinfectant wipes and spray .
 we pulled all wipes off the floor and expensed them for store use only
 nature &apos;s miracle has been consistently in stock on amazon .
  it &apos;s not a disinfectant spray ,  but works great for dog piss .
  might want to check pet co or chewy if you &apos;re not an amazon fan .
 that &apos;s the covid .
 yeah ,  and almost all the toys he brings are made in china !
 very suspicious santa claus .
 i mean technically you get presents if you &apos;re good .
 and coal if you &apos;re naughty .
 so in a way there is a deal in place ?
 rewards for good behavior .
 milk and cookies left as offerings .
 sounds like fey territory to me .
 haha yeah ik it’s a gigantic understatement but i didn’t really feel like typing more
 wait shit that’s a real thing ?
 damn i thought i was just making a joke lol
 don &apos;t be lasagna .
 are you my mommy ?
 do they not meet santa claus in some episode ?
 “it doesn’t do biscuits !
 “what do you mean it doesn’t ‘do’ biscuits ?
 damn that &apos;s wild .
 that &apos;s all crazy but it makes 100% sense and i have nothing to refute it .
 try a steam bag of peas from the frozen section and a little lemon pepper .
 and if you get the mixed veggies you can get cocktail swords and stab your food to eat it like the toddlers for some real entrainment while you eat lol !
 i hope she &apos;s doing ok !
 i &apos;m sure that will make her day
 y &apos;all got bleach ?
 i haven &apos;t seen that since february .
 huh ,  i never considered that maybe what happened .
 i heard he has labor camps in which ostracized groups of elves are forced to mass produce toys .
 there &apos;s also that he demands you make cookies and pour a glass of milk for him .
 no worries ,  just one of those times i couldn &apos;t help but comment .
 like calling the franco-prussian war  &apos;a series of increasingly heated disagreements between neighbours .
  &apos; you got a chuckle out of me !
 ok ,  you just went from  &apos;comedy genius &apos; to  &apos;amusing rube &apos; in one post ,  man .
 my favorite quote from the whole show .
  &apos;i want my mommy .
 that sounds familiar .
 wasn &apos;t that a capaldi episode ?
 yeah ,  sign me up for pre-order .
 that sounds delicious .
 i’ll have to try it .
 everything tastes better when eaten off a sword .
 that &apos;s the secret ,  seasoning !
 we don &apos;t have to eat our veggies plain !
 lemon pepper is the absolute best .
 this is one legit ass mom !
 bleach everywhere ,  clorox wipes never
 a gallon of bleach lasts a year+ at my house .
  haven &apos;t even had to re-stock since all this started
 well this definitely took a turn .
 so all elves are chinese ?
 is xi jinping santa for the west ?
 they are working the gay elves/dentists
 i mean i don’t wanna take credit for a joke i didn’t mean to make ,  idk why ,  it’s just how i work i guess

 it &apos;s probably not exhaustive .
    solidworks / inventor (students only) .
    sfm source film maker .
    iina (for macos only) .
 audibook / e-book .
    chapter and verse .
 os / infrastructure .
 added fusion 360 ,  r ,  python ,  unity ,  unreal engine ,  godot ,  sublime text ,  paint .
 net ,  solidworks ,  medibang ,  openstreetmap ,  potplayer and fixed sketchup position ,  as per comments .
 thanks for the silver !
 added brave browser ,  intellij idea ,  atom ,  lightworks and iina
 usps and ups both will deliver free packaging boxes ,  envelopes ,  bubble wrap ,  etc .
 literally doesnt cost a thing and you can get like 50 boxes at a time .
 this is the most useful post on reddit .
 endless free college books
 best adblocker by a mile .
 websites are 95% ads and 5% content nowadays but ublock brings balance to the force !
 works on all browsers even mobile !
 maybe not everyone ,  but for students zotero is a lifesaver .
 it will store your sources ,  import them to a bibliography in whatever citation style you need ,  and even create in-text citations in your paper .
 it saves hours of work .
 lots of free classic books .

 edu email through your school that uses gmail ,  you get unlimited google drive storage .
 library genesis ,  a great place to look for and download college/university textbooks for free ,  as well as other books .
 as commenters have pointed out ,  it has unfortunately been blocked in some countries .
 a vpn/tor could help in this case .
 removed direct link .
 wikipedias reading lists .
 the article itself often holds a pretty good collection of relevant information ,  yet for in depth research it can be hard to find proper literature .
 wikipedia always quotes their sources which often are the most relevant for a topic .
 unless you aren &apos;t researching for your phd .
 you can save a lot of time in literature research .
 i &apos;m going to save this like i have the other 100 useful reddit questions i didn &apos;t know i wanted to be answered ,  and never look at it again .
 reddit coins right now ,  just upvote shit and you may get some
 your local library almost certainly allows you to access free ebooks and audiobooks via overdrive (and the libby app) ,  hoopla ,  or borrowbox .
 all you need is a library card and a pin ,  which you &apos;ll probably need to get in-branch -- but really ,  is there ever a bad excuse to go to a library ?
 the selection might be limited ,  but if you want to splash out a little ,  you can get a year &apos;s out-of-state access to brooklyn public library for $50 .
 that &apos;s not as good as free ,  but it can be a lot cheaper than using audible ,  especially if you get through audiobooks at a real rate .
 youtube lessons on how to do anything your heart desires .
 there are thousands upon thousands of college courses available for free .
  some have a cost ,  but most of them have a free audit version where you get all the videos ,  lectures ,  content ,  but no certificate .
  so if you don &apos;t care about the certificate ,  you don &apos;t have to pay anything .
 i &apos;ve done a few computer science ones .
  i took a few coursea courses on machine learning ,  i took harvard &apos;s cs50 course ,  i learned a lot of software engineering and web development from free courses .
  another one i intend to take advantage of is called nand to tetris ,  which teaches how computers work from primitive boolean algebra to actual functional operating systems .
 codecademy is an awesome site to learn how to use some programming languages .
 doesn &apos;t get into the really advanced stuff ,  but it &apos;s good for a start .
 google maps and waze are so useful if still blows my mind that they are free .
 waze does have ads that show up when you are stopped but it &apos;s still free and had a lot of great features .
 they have slowly been moving the more popular features to google maps too like speed trap reports and current speed/speed limit .
 in the us ,  state controllers offices of unclaimed funds .

 creative commons search functions on websites like youtube and google .

 250 free coins for participating in reddit
 we take it for granted in this youtube era but just a few decades ago ,  music wasn &apos;t accessible to people at all and not even the rich had access to all types of it .
 now this globalized era has given us countless options

 courses on how to write software .
 we only need more of it as the years go by .
 software jobs will probably always be in high demand !
 mp3 juices takes youtube videos and converts them to audio downloads .
 i heard this online and is soon to try it .
 so basicly you add a  &apos;+1 &apos; or  &apos;+2 &apos; before the  &apos;@ &apos; in your email ,  the website should recognise it as a new email but all the emails from the website should send it to the email address without the  &apos;+1 &apos; at the end .
 this should alow you to have unlimited trials on one email .
 cards against humanity online .

 maybe give some much needed sage wisdom ?
 all for the low low price of nothing at all .
 everyone knows wikipedia is free but did you know you can download all of wikipedia to view offline ?

 youtube ,  you can learn whatever craft or skill you want to learn for free ,  from a to z ,  you just need to know how to find the good material  .
 ncbi website ,  you can look up all kinds of medical research and if you are thinking about doing a surgery or something that isn &apos;t that necessary you can look up data and decide better rather than spending a shit ton of money asking specialists and just see a doc when you &apos;d made up your mind
 its free ,  accurate ,  information .
 that is so rare .
 its unbiased ,  its great for general knowledge and it bas practically anything you need .
 we need wikipedia .
 kinda redundant but reddit is a pretty valuable resource .
 be it for educational purposes ,  news or ,  well ,  porn i guess .
 or for crowdsourcing ideas for that article/paper/project by asking people on r/askreddit

 bored and need inspiration for your next research project ?
 gooooo to gootle scholar .
 not sure if climate change is really a thing ?
 google scholar has plenty of articles that prove it exists .
 anyways ,  google scholar is so important because people need to see what an actual scientific study looks like ,  what actual data looks like ,  and a real explanation on why the data matters .
 please please please !
 i know a lot of them are hard to read but practice .
 you &apos;ll be so more more informed about how stuff works .
 i saw this in a previous post .
 this should be a lot higher .
 it &apos;s taken me a long time to get used to the idea that i never have to pay for a book ever again .
 confirmed ,  i just downloaded two textbooks a few days ago ,  saved me about $300 .
 z-library seems to be a library genesis mirror ,  libgen has the same books ,  no download restrictions .
 this site nearly singlehandedly cured my fear of flying .
 this just kept me entertained forever !
 that’s a cool app .
 i use it when i pick up people from airport when they visit ,  it’s always more accurate than what the airport shows .
 also the buy nothing project on facebook .
 if available in your area it’s hyper local gifting and wishing for items .

 wow ,  that &apos;s a shocker .
 used to work at a ups store ,  and we charged a ton of money for boxes and bubble wrap .

 this thread has made me believe that the world is a fraction of a slight better than i thought it was .
 the podcast reply all has a fascinating episode about this .
 episode 144 breaks down how intuit has been doing it for years .
 why is filing taxes not free in the usa ?
 freetaxusa is free for anyone to use ,  no income limit at all .
 they make their money selling a deluxe package ,  which you don &apos;t really need ,  and charging $12 .
 95 to file your state taxes ,  which again ,  you may not need (in my state of nj electronically filing your state tax is free using the state &apos;s website) .
 didn´t know they also have books .
 we owe many thanks to genius russian women who started this .
 and russia for not interfering .
 sci hub is great .
 org has millions of books available to download as pdfs for free .
 two of my textbooks last semester were on there and i was pretty stoked .
 man ,  i love ublock origin .
 unfortunately it’s not available on ios because apple’s uses a proprietary extension system .
 if i had to use the internet without ublock i &apos;d probably just go outside and get proper hobbies and friends .
 also if you aren &apos;t already ,  start using firefox ,  chrome is removing the part of the extension api that allows adblockers to work because they want more cash money .
 #where was this when i was doing my research article ?
 and it integrates with google docs to auto populate your references
 uc berkely used to have 20 , 000 videos of their courses available for free online ,  but two employees from another university removed them by suing under the americans with disabilities act complaining that they didn &apos;t have closed captioning and therefore discriminated against deaf people .
 all 20 , 000 videos were deleted
 correct me if i’m wrong but they don’t give you any accreditation for completing their courses right  ?
 this would be school without the pressure of payments and grades ,  just strictly for the sake of learning  ?
 terms may be changed any time at their discretion ,  without notice to the user  .
 this should be illegal .
 you mean like all of us .
 does anyone read that stuff ?
 ah yes ,  the good ol &apos; reddit hug of death .
 this one is really incredible .
  such a diverse range of books from classic stuff like little engine that could to new stuff like llama llama .
  its pretty amazing what she &apos;s done .
 dolly is a saint .
 she has done so much for her community .
 i hate country music but i love that woman .
 tennessean here ,  we don &apos;t deserve dolly .
 by all accounts an excellent human being .
 i am so bummed that they don &apos;t have one in my area .
 i &apos;ve got a friend with twins who shares her books with me .
 but i &apos;d love to get a new book every month for my kid !
 dolly is the closest thing this world has ever known to a genuine angel .
 her program partners with my state deaf blind project and they sent all my daughters(she &apos;s deaf/blind) books with a braille overlay of all the pages .
 it was so amazing to get those !
 org and archive .
 a lot of free useful books and articles .
 i thought project gutenberg was a site dedicated to making more police academy movies
 does it use spaced repetition ?
 i have anki to thank for my entire degree .
 i used to work for american airlines ,  if you do use this ,  make sure you have a completely separate reservation for your return flight .
 once you miss a segment of your flight ,  airlines will usually cancel any other flights on that reservation because they assume you won &apos;t make them either .
 i fly a lot for work ,  i recieved a cease and desist letter for doing this saying i would be banned from the airline .
 be careful with this one
 scottscheapflights is another service like this .
 it specifically scans for extreme discounts ,  mistakes ,  and flights at odd hours .
 it &apos;ll email you discounts it finds for the destinations and departure locations you mark ,  so if you want to fly out of lax to paris ,  dubai ,  new york ,  or budapest ,  it will not be sending you info on cheap flights to buttfuck nowhere ,  indiana .
 recently found august/september dates for a flight to tokyo from denver for $450/$500 when they are at best usually around $1 , 200 .
 and about 1/3rd of them were direct flights ,  not a parade of layovers .
 yup - do it enough and airlines will block you from using them ;)
 just found way cheaper flights to africa on this .
 going to keep an eye on it an hopefully get a good deal .
 great tip and this can make a huge difference if your local aiport is overpriced or has a slight airline monoply (clt ,  cvg) .
 a few things to keep in mind if doing this: .
 \-do not check a bag .
 also you can get kinda screwed if they run out of storage space and you are forced to check at the gate .
 \-buy your return trip separately .
 \-don &apos;t do it excessively ,  (for routine business travel) ,  as you could get banned from airline or miles taken away .
 huge number of grateful dead bootlegs too
 also ,  you can use the student email for jetbrains and get the professional versions of all their ides like pycharm ,  clion etc .
 i ran my website on that digitalocean credit for 10 months ,  and i still use all the jetbrains stuff regularly .
 can &apos;t recommend it enough .
 excuse me what ?
 also amazon prime is half-price with an edu address .
 curse my school and their office 360 .
 i say this because i just don &apos;t care for office and try not to use it for anything outside of work ,  less one spreadsheet i have .
  some of the changes that they make to their software is just stupid to me .
  like the fact that in outlook ,  i can no longer sort my email by read/unread .
  yes ,  i can view just the unread emails on it &apos;s own tab but the ability to have my unread email at the top while still having all of my other things available was super useful for my own organizational purposes .
  having to create a filter or a rule to do some things that it already used to do just seems goofy to me and it drives me nuts .
 i will always upvote libgen !
 my first two semesters of college i went through amazon/on campus bookstore and then discovered libgen because of reddit ,  meaning i bought maybe $150 worth of textbooks for the rest of my undergrad totalling only about $500ish for all four years .
 unfortunately it doesn’t work for everyone since more classes are having online access codes nowadays .
 my roommate was spending $1000 on textbooks a semester solely for the access codes because his business classes all used them .
 mods removed the original comment because it linked directly to the website which is probably against reddit tos .
 it’s called library genesis so hopefully isn’t hard to find .
 alternatively ,  pm me and i can pm you .
 edit 2: just to clarify ,  this is piracy and not just cheap textbooks or anything and there is the chance that they won’t have your book/the link for the download doesn’t work .
 keep trying the provided mirrors if one doesn’t work .
 this would &apos;ve been really helpful while i was still in college
 this is so freaking cool !
 i love how seamless it is .
 when flipping through channels  it picks  random videos based on the  &apos;channel &apos; programming ,   and it does not always start at the beginning ,  just like regular scheduled tv .
 i &apos;ve been checking this out only for a few minutes but already have been introduced into new music i love - that i &apos;ve never seen previously and also seen commercials for movies i want to watch - also that i have never heard of before .
 totally different way of traversing the youtube rabbit hole .
 i killed a whole boring work day on here one day .
 i fucking love this !
 i flipped it on to 1998 and it was a marilyn manson concert - next channel was dexter &apos;s lab - next was an ad for all new reeses puffs cereal .
 what a grand idea this dude had .
 i don &apos;t understand the hate that teachers and professors have for wiki .
  like you said ,  i wouldn &apos;t want to use it as my doctoral thesis ,  but for most people it &apos;s fine as a starting point or if you &apos;re not in school it tells you about a topic that you only want a basic idea of .
 stuffinspace was a website that really blew my mind .
 i thought before then that there were maybe a few hundred satellites in space .
 didn’t realize how much shit was in orbit until visiting that site .
 it &apos;s great ,  but the files export in horrible quality .
 i was able to mess around with the spleeter code in google collaboratory to get good quality exports .
 it took a while since i had no coding knowledge ,  but it was still great to have completely in a browser .
 also ,  the website does work on mobile ,  at least when i tried it .
 they now make you pay for doing more than two songs .
 is there any website that does it for free ?
 i feel like all of the decent free stem separating sites eventually make you pay .
 what does credit karma get out of you ?
 if you use reddit .
 never in my life .
 surprised i had to scroll so far down ,  whenever i hear anyone getting a new pc or im replacing mine its always the first place i go just because i will forget to download some software and wont realise until i need it
 using ninite also reliably shields you from the &apos;untick this random box or you will get 5 shitty programs you don &apos;t need  &apos; bullshit
 i &apos;ve never heard of letterboxing until you had me just google it .
 and now i want to find a clue near me to get started !
 any specific places you &apos;ve found online for letterboxers to gather and for someone to get started ?
 that’s why i screenshot the ones that i want to remember so i can eventually come across it in my 18 , 000 photos on my icloud storage haha it’s ridiculous but at least i know it’s somewhere i can find it again 
 all day ,  every day ,  and nothing .
 i &apos;ve never heard of getting coins from upvotes .
 how does that work ?
 is it just some random reward / promotional thing ?
 i got mine yesterday randomly .
 what are their uses ?
 i &apos;ve had like three or four people tell me they randomly got 250 coins from upvoting my comments ,  must be good luck or something
 i never have luck when it comes to things like this - .
 upvoted ,  didn’t work
 it made me aware of the suit against equifax for leaking my data and that should be a settlement worth over a $100 .
 it won &apos;t be because of some bullshit around how it was set up .
 there &apos;s a cap on how much total money will be given and that amount will be divided between all the people who signed up .
 the settlement set aside a total of $31 million to give to affected people who signed up to receive the $125 .
 that means that you &apos;d only get the full $125 if 248 , 000 people or less signed up .
 there were 147 million people who qualified and could have signed up .
 if even just 1 million people signed up then you &apos;re only getting $31 .
 if 5 million people signed up (only about 3 .
 4% of those affected) then you &apos;re only getting $6 .
 they stated that signups were  &apos;overwhelming &apos; so i &apos;d bet the number was even higher than that .
 tl;dr you &apos;d be lucky to get $5 from it .
 i &apos;d be on somewhere around $1 .
 in other words ,  the equifax settlement that exposed you to identity theft will likely give you less value than the red bull settlement that gave you a case of red bull for free ,  which is a giant fucking middle finger to all of us poor people .
 thanks ,  this is cool .
 after browsing the gap one made me laugh .
 you can get a $6 or $12 voucher to their store .
 seems like they kind of win in that one .
 i was paid $3 for some class action lawsuit relating to bad tuna .
 i think it &apos;s still in my paypal account .
 your local library likely also has dvds that you can take out .
 if your library is really up to speed ,  they &apos;ll have an app that you can use to request items from other libraries in their system and they will alert you when the items are in .
 if your library is really ,  really up to speed ,  they might have maker facilities with things like a 3d printer .
 i &apos;ve done a lot of 3d printing by going to a library ,  finding a pattern on thingiverse ,  and printing it .
 they even supply the filament so it &apos;s entirely free .
 our local library has ebooks ,  audio books ,  dvds ,  movies ,  puzzles ,  magazines ,  travel books ,  movies with popcorn on friday afternoons ,  music by local artists on sunday afternoons ,  classes that range from yoga to finance to painting .
  libraries are more than just books .
 not all online ,  but i love to give them credit for all they do .
 i &apos;ve picked up woodworking entirely from youtube .
 any cut ,  joint ,  tool ,  or anything else i want to use ,  i can easily find several techniques for doing it and what works best for my needs .
 it also makes me happy that all these older men (predominantly) have this new avenue to share their decades of knowledge of their craft with the world .
 i &apos;ve learned some very basic car maintenance via youtube that has saved me hundreds of dollars over the years .
  i also use it to learn proper form on some workouts i do when i &apos;m alone .
  youtube is really ,  really great .
 i did like 10-20 moocs ,  mostly out of curiosity ,  how various online learning platform work .
 the best one ever was on edx ,   analyzing and visualizing data with excel .
 this one helped me to shine at work and was also fun for me .
 as a networker ,  cool platform to learn new technologies is cisco dcloud .
 i recommended this to my 14yo for the summer .
 i &apos;m interested in seeing what he learns .
 i completed the html ,  css and python courses on there - incredibly good for a free service .
 after just that python course i could create a text based game in a command prompt/terminal from scratch .
 so not advanced like you said but a very good start .
 google maps is a godsend .
  i love that they &apos;ve got public transit routes in there too - it &apos;s really helpful when i &apos;m traveling to other cities without a vehicle .
 you can also download maps for offline use ,  i did this when traveling abroad and i couldnt use data .
 waze has been pissing me off lately .
 sent me right into a traffic jam this morning .
 to add to this ,  a non-browser ,  free image editor is gimp .
 wow ,  all in the browser .
 that &apos;s pretty sick .
 i use pixlr ,  have done for years .
 same features ,  don &apos;t see any big advantage or disadvantage over photopea but they both deserve a shout out !
 tank wars every time
 run 2 was the life
 cool math games now has poptropica .
 what a time to be alive
 pfft that &apos;s nothing - canada post will charge you double the retail price for them !
 how exactly does this process go ?
 yeah this is amazing .
 i was owed $2 , 700 by the university i went to because i had dropped some classes late and at the time was told i couldn’t be reimbursed .
 got a check in the mail a few weeks later .
 i had dropped out of school about 12 years earlier .
 i just spent waaaaaaaaaay too long looking up my friends names 
 i actually work for a law firm in florida that specializes in locating unclaimed money and the owner or their heirs if the owner is deceased .
 i get paid to give people money .
 it’s an amazing job that i started 11 years ago .
 if anyone needs advice about the claims process ,  send me a message .
 and their digital equivalent /r/efreebies
 man freebies these days are no good compared to what they were giving out years ago .
 i remember getting free shirts ,  free full sized snacks ,  good magazine subscriptions (time ,  wired ,  popular mechanics) .
 one hell of a list
 wait till you get to higher level math .
 then it doesn &apos;t work anymore !
 be careful ,  most of them get exploited and your emails passwords ,  and ips get leaked .
 source: me after 5 different dudes all over the world tried to log into my email .
 after a quick search i found out it was cpr
 there &apos;s also libreoffice .
 personally preferred over open office .
 i think i used google docs in college more than word ,  even though i had word through school .
 being able to collaborate on the same project at the same time was awesome
 while google docs wins for making documents collaboratively ,  as a power user i have yet to come across anything that holds a candle to ms office in any other basis .
 i forgot this was the name of a service so i thought you were from the south .
 there are a couple of game apps for that .
 it &apos;s really entertaining while you even might learn something .
 the wiki game and wikigame on android .
 this can be a very dangerous spiral though .
 you &apos;ll start off reading about john f .
 kennedy and then somehow half an hour later you &apos;re looking at the lifespan of conjoined twins .
 there &apos;s a very simple cheat-code to  &apos;win &apos; the various  &apos;connecting random wikipedia articles to each other &apos; game .
 almost every article will have a link to a country in it .
 almost every country &apos;s article will have a link to their involvement in wwii .
 from there you can get to almost any other country - and then just reverse engineer your way back to whatever the second topic is .
 after i realized this ,  playing the  &apos;connect a random wikipedia article to hitler &apos; game is no longer any fun .
 it still can take some figuring out to connect two different random articles ,  though .
 this is way too far down in this thread .
  so many resources available .
 how do i get these free coins i keep hearing about ?
 i remember waiting to press record with a tape ready on the radio .
 and then that fucking dickhead radio dude started talking near the end of the song .
 every time i hear someone say  &apos;i was born in the wrong decade &apos; because they like older music ,  i get irrationally irritated because no ,  you werent ,  you were born in a decade that lets you hear that music anytime ,  anywhere ,  as many times as you want .
 so shut the fuck up and listen to more of whatever music you just needed to be born 30 years earlier to appreciate 
 definitely ,  back in 2012 i was taking a chemistry class at age 60 !
 i had a lot of problems figuring out the proper formula for certain calculations .
  been a nurse all my life i was very comfortable with algebra and equations .
 well these were not equations .
 my brain didn’t want to go there .
 i struggled for a while .
 i found khan academy towards the end of my class and i was able to pass the whole course with a b .
 their math courses are better than any college course i &apos;ve taken .
 the instructor does a really great job of making math approachable
 edx is another very useful resource for getting high quality university courses for free
 my daughter plays with kahn academy kids on my wife &apos;s phone and she loves it .
 warning: lastpass is owned by logmein and has been trialing capping free users at only 20 passwords .
 it was bought out by a capital group ,  so shit &apos;s rolling downhill fast .
 bitwarden is just the better solution now .
 i &apos;m moving today .
 would recommend bitwarden over other password managers .
 it’s open source and the major features are free
 channel names by any chance ?
 i cant believe how much i watched them dig that hole .
 before i purchased any textbooks ,  i always searched for a pdf version of it online
 blender is a 3d creation suite ,  if you are specifically looking for a free video editor check out blackmagic davinci resolve 16
 i used that to make a low poly car lol
 am i the only one who doesn &apos;t like gimp ?
 i tried it and really wanted to like it but the ui is so hard to navigate .
 even the most basic tools were difficult to use .
 i got so frustrated googling every step that i ended up uninstalling it .
 i wish adobe wasn &apos;t so greedy and had a basic license for ps .
 i wouldn &apos;t mind paying $100 or something instead of their ridiculously overpriced subscription fees .
 i play everyday :)
 i think most already do
 i &apos;m happy to hear that .
 how did it cured it exactly ?
 maybe is it because you now can see how many planes fly each day and realize that the odds of  a crash are very low ?
 if you saw how much work goes into making sure commercial aviation is safe you wouldn’t be concerned .
 just search ups free box delivery and it should pop up right away
 just wanted to comment that while these are all great resources ,  and i use them all the time ,  make sure to double check the photo is actually posted by the photographer .
 i’ve heard of instances where people will post copyrighted photos ( taken by others ) on sites and people will use them assuming they are copyright free .
 anything you like .
 no copyright etc .
 honestly it’s actually probably worse than you think because in most countries the government does your taxes for you and sends you a receipt to check over .
 the only reason we still have to our own taxes is because companies like turbo tax have lobbied the government to keep them in business .
 free file is part of the compromise they made with the government so that they can keep screwing everyone .
 there are free ways to do it ,  but it can seem daunting or complicated to people who don &apos;t know how it all works ,  don &apos;t understand the various forms ,  don &apos;t know which deductions they qualify for ,  etc .
  a lot of people pay places like turbotax and h&r block to do it for them .
 there have been repeated attempts to make the process much simpler ,  but turbo tax lobbying crushes it every time .
 hijacking this comment to say - if you are ever looking for a pdf of a research paper and you can &apos;t find it (paywall ,  not on scihub) just email the author of the paper .
 you &apos;ll find the corresponding author info on the page for the paper (ncbi or elsevier or whatnot) .
 shoot them an email and they will almost certainly be happy to share their work .
 almost all academic libraries are part of a consortium with other libraries and have the ability to get students books and articles that aren’t in their current collection for free .
 articles are generally delivered in pdf format via email 1-3 days after the request is made .
 look for information on inter-library loan on your library’s website .
 source: am a community college librarian .
 and it has plugins to export stuff either for bibtex or biblatex so it also works nicely with latex !
 i just looked up the story .
 thankfully the videos were archived in several places and are still available online .
 imagine being the guy who has to caption college lectures .
 you could basically get multiple degrees just by doing your job and paying attention .
 that &apos;s fucking insane .
  i &apos;m completely sympathetic to those with disabilities ,  i have numerous folks in my own family who benefit from the ada ,  but if the most cost-effective solution to comply is to delete a massive free resource you &apos;ve helped no one .
  that &apos;s not a  &apos;reasonable accommodation &apos; you are asking for .
  sometimes it just fucking sucks to be deaf or blind ,  and it &apos;s nobody &apos;s fault .
 that drives me nuts
 it reminds of what happened in toronto a long time ago .
 a wheelchair advocated sued all the old movie theatres to try and get them to install elevators (stair lifts were degrading in her opinion) ,  with the result that most of those theatres had to close because they couldn &apos;t afford the renovation or because it was physically impossible to modify the building &apos;s footprint to include an elevator .
 after they closed ,  she claimed it wasn &apos;t her intention ,  but the damage was done .
 i see it as an alternative source of learning for when you already are in college or uni .
 maybe you didn &apos;t understand something in your class and search for a better explanation or you just learn better from those free sources .
 nothing to loose .
 especially considering that you &apos;d still be in violation of the tos if they changed it and you didn &apos;t read it again because you didn &apos;t get notified of the change in the first place cause it &apos;s up to you to keep abreast of the changes !
 is this from george carlin ?
 my daughter has even got bilingual ones (we live in florida ,  there are a lot of people who speak spanish) so it &apos;s super helpful for her to be learning a little bit of spanish as well .
 she just got a llama llama book this month !
 i just moved to east tennessee ,  and she is a legend here .
 roads named after her ,  a statue in downtown sevierville ,  and everyone knows when she is in town .
 well deserved ,  as she has done everything in her power to create jobs and lift the area out of poverty .
 i liked her before ,  but now love her more then ever !
 she &apos;s a national treasure
 while we &apos;re talking about books ,  most libraries have an e-reader program like libby or overdrive .
 i have seriously increased my reading this year after i found that out !
 just today i finished some cards that i won’t review again until 20 days from now .
 anki singlehandedly popularised srs
 yeah ,  and it allows you a tremendous amount of control over how often cards come back for review .
 you can set a really aggressive schedule if you want .
 more often than not shit like that isn &apos;t called out
 yeah my girlfriend almost got stranded in brazil because of this .
 she missed her connecting flight and had to buy a new one way ticket into brazil ,  no one told her her entire trip had been cancelled ,  bought a one way ticket to the international airport in brazil 9 months later to come home where her return flight would have left from and found out it had been cancelled .
 didn’t have enough money for an entire new ticket ($2000ish) ,  luckily talked it down to like $600 with customer service ,  but it was some bullshit .
 that should be illegal
 oh wow ,  that &apos;s crazy .
 it &apos;s so dumb - if airlines ,  as private businesses ,  are allowed to price fares as they please ,  customers should be able to buy fares and use (or not use) individual legs as they please .
 in your case with all the flights ,  wouldn &apos;t racking up the miles with standard tickets behoove you instead of skiplagging anyway ?
 i second this ,  although it &apos;s a bit different from the op .
 i got a rt flight to china for $300 ,  hong kong $450 ,  and japan for next year &apos;s cherry blossom season for $600 ,  all way cheaper than the usual prices from the west coast of the us .
 thank you for the highly intelligent action of incorporating links in your comments .
 my dad recently had a debilitating stroke ,  and i feel like i &apos;ve lost him .
 your comment reminded me that he reviewed a few dead concerts on archive ,  and i &apos;m headed over right now to listen to them .
 thanks for reminding me these were out there .
 back in 2005 ,  i started a podcast (way early in the game) .
 i used archive .
 org as the host .
 those old eps are still there and playable .
 i’ve used it several times for small business podcasts .
 massively unappreciated resource .
 shit i didn &apos;t know this .
  the community edition has been working well for me regardless though .
 quick fix ,  install 30 flag poles in capital parliament hill .
 i’d hope that would reduce the wait time .
 i assume there’s a couple of flag poles right now and they give away the flag after it flys for a day .
 so 30 should decrease the wait time significantly i’d hope .
 obviously no quick fix on the pence one .
 unless they’d want to switch the flag halfway through the day or fly 2 flags at once .
 start flying an absolute fuckton of flags over the parliament .
 that should help .
 i don &apos;t want free space in the sky .
 i don &apos;t want to see blue ,  i want to see red and white and leaf .
 i just ordered and it said  &apos;exceeds 100 years &apos; lol .
 #canadians get a free canada flag that was flown on parliament hill .
 only a 40 year wait tho .
 they require additional information now .
 i think it &apos;s because some schools slow alumni to retain their edu address .
 i still have mine and it &apos;s been about 4 years since i &apos;ve taken any courses there .
 for those saying i &apos;m wrong ,  it might vary based on the domain ?
 or some are saying you only get 4 years regardless .
 it might also vary on your location .
 but overall it looks like most of the replies i &apos;m getting are from people who have had the same experience i did .
 couldn &apos;t even spring for 365 ,  huh ?
 assuming your school only has the free plan ,  you get 1tb of onedrive storage .
 if your school is paying for 5 or more users ,  you get unlimited onedrive storage
 guess that was the first lesson of business class .
 if you can artificially create an inelastic demand ,  and strangle the market so you have a monopoly ,  you can milk someone for every cent they have .
 students in the u .
 really are getting fucked .
 i payed roughly $300 tuition per semester to attend one of germanys best universities ,  and that included a ticket for public transport (worth about $400 if i had to buy the ticket directly) .
 i sometimes had to buy books (about $50 per book ,  maybe 8 in total) but in most cases everything was scanned and available at copy shops or online .
 if you went to the copy shop you had to pay a little fee and the printing costs ,  so about $5 per binder .
 i think there is a system behind making education so inaccessible ,  especially for the working class .
 omg you just made me happy !
 damn i love this thread !
 my god this is life changing
 i assume most of the ire is because some dumb dumbs cite wikipedia and not wikipedia &apos;s citations .
 but also ,  wiki made it easier and more convenient to find sources so time spent researching a topic was cut down a lot .
 i feel like some of my teachers saw it as a slacker &apos;s approach to assignments and were bitter that the student &apos;s lives were now much easier than theirs had been .
 they &apos;re advertising different cards to you i guess .
 don &apos;t worry ,  this person is just helping the people who will be writing this up as an article on another website !
 this is going to make my job 10x easier .
 i want to know it too
 is it because upvotes make your comment appear higher in the list ?
 the redditers with the gold are more likely to see it and give you coins ?
 you can give awards .
 (silver ,  gold ,  platinum ,  and sub-reddit specific awards .
 i think mine showed up 2 days ago .
 idk they are randomly giving away coins
 yes but i don’t care .
 i already have free credit monitoring .
 i want equifax to mail me a check and if it costs them more to process ,  print and mail that check then i actually “profit” then good .
 i don &apos;t have access to a workshop or fancy tools ,  so it &apos;s great to find tutorials of people doing stuff with the  &apos;basics &apos; instead of with equipment that a) i can &apos;t afford ,  and b) i &apos;d have nowhere to store then if i could !
 having said that ,  i do enjoy seeing people doing stuff that i might never have the opportunity to do .
 but it &apos;s also great to find wood-working tutorials for  &apos;the rest of us &apos; !
 i use youtube for car repairs as well .
  it’s saved me thousands .
 that &apos;s some catch me if you can shit lol .
 every time i look for tutorials related to microsoft office software ,  i &apos;m greeted with an indian accent .
 and teenage girls who are better at doing makeup or hair than they should be .
 they seriously upped my skills so i can make my face and hair look less like an orc .
 give him some ideas or challenges what to use his coding skills for .
 it can become quite school-like (boring) to learn coding by coding just for codings sake .
 it &apos;s super useful in europe where public transit actually works .
 i never once had to visit any city &apos;s public transit website to get information on how to get where ,  i just put where and when i need to be and google maps handles the rest .
 wow okay i will definitely check this citymapper app you guys are talking about !
 wow i never heard of that
 i use gimp for quick photo editing at work ,  since our office has only one license and the marketing department uses it .
 only weird part was asking my boss for admin privileges so i could install gimp .
 definitely a bit of a weird name
 yes ,  gimp is the current king of free photoshop alternatives .
 only issue is that for people familiar with photoshop &apos;s layout and workflow ,  gimp can be tough to switch to ,  at least initially .
 i understand the core engine behind gimp is very well fleshed out ,  however from memory gimp was initially written for another engine ,  so a lot of potential functionality (lossless editing for one) is yet to be realized .
 any way you look at it ,  photopea is ideal for small jobs ,  then move onto gimp or photoshop for bigger jobs
 net is amazing as well ,  been using it for years .
 it &apos;s creator is ivan kutskir .
 he has done two ama &apos;s as well and he is awesome .
 one user asked him -  .
 do you take feature requests ?
 (triple-click to select a full line or sentence of text would be nice .
 ivan - that sounds like a great feature !
 i just implemented it .
 guy is cool as fuck .
 no account sign-ups either ?
 nowadays it &apos;s more likely to find jesus christ himself

 the legends combine .
 this is what the singularity looks like
 i haven &apos;t tried open office in some time .
 when i switched from that to libreoffice ,  it seemed open was recreating office 2003 ,  and libreoffice was based on 2010 .
 bless your heart .
 i think the browser version is called ‘4 clicks to hitler’ .
 yeah yeah i know ‘nein clicks to hitler’ is a better name but that’s way too many
 if someone was wondering ,  there have been cases of conjoined twins living for over 70 years .
 they have a normal lifespan .
 i know this because i have an interest in presidential assassination attempts .
 connect to hitler (or any one thing) starts to be solvable .
 as you memorize the end paths to hitler .
  but connecting apple to shakespeare ,  and the helen hunt to giraffe .
 that can go and go .
 although some are not solvable .
 that’s the downside .
 there are ,  i believe ,  many enclosed pockets within wikipedia .
 maybe why getting the app someone mentioned would be best .
 it &apos;s actually crazy .
 didnt discover it until my last year and made a world of difference so i like to let people know to use all the resources that are available
 reddit has been semi-randomly giving out coins (the things you use to buy gold) to users who upvote a lot or something .
 fuckers would talk in the middle of songs .
 i &apos;ve hated radio djs since i was a teenager because of that shit .
 patrickjmt &apos;s youtube channel was a godsend for the math courses i had to take in my me curriculum .
 some of my math professors were brilliant but couldn &apos;t verbally explain what an integral was actually doing .
 patrick was able to explain it in 10 seconds .
 shit ,  i hadn &apos;t heard that :(
 can &apos;t remember any ,  it &apos;s been a few years .
 just search for something like  &apos;newton raphson method lecture &apos; on youtube and go with the guy with the best accent .
 i had it on my phone all day at work and had the same conversation dozens of times .
  &apos;what are you watching ?
 people dig a hole .
 because they &apos;re digging a hole .
 because people are paying them to do it .
 so that they dig a hole .
 it was endless fun .
 with google ,  you can do your search and append  .
 and it will list only pdfs .
 i have gotten several textbooks this way
 +1 for davinci resolve .
 its a professional-grade video editor that &apos;s free ,  from a company that makes highly-respected pro-video gear .
 has literally hundreds of useful features .
 wait ,  you work for tesla ?
 basically exactly that - watching all the planes ,  all the thousands of planes at once ,  not crashing ,  day after day .
 i went from not flying for ten years to moving to a different hemisphere ,  i don &apos;t know if i would have been as calm about it if not for that app on my phone .
 sure ,  nerves still come up every time ,  but it &apos;s nothing like it used to be .
 that sounds more like it .
 for a while i used h&r block every year to file my taxes .
  only because i had multiple jobs ,  lived and worked in multiple states ,  had military pay ,  had children ,  was attending college ,   received rental income ,  and all kinds of other fun stuff .
 the i simplified ,  sold my rental home ,  settled into one job ,  graduated ,  kept my investments in a 401k ,  and left the military .
  it took me three years to realize that for $25 ,  turbotax could do the same thing in less time .
 it took me another two years to realize that i really didn &apos;t need turbotax either .
 here ,  we file taxes via a website from the official tax office .
 no extra software or fancy mumbo needed ,  most of your information has already been filled in .
 one time ,  my email was responded with a private google drive link with not only the paper i requested ,  but all papers in that field the professor had written .
 dude was awesome .
 actually tried this a few weeks back and they got back to me with a pdf of the chapter i needed :)
 could you please provide a link ?
 you caption these videos in one minute segments along with 10 , 000 other mturk/crowdsource workers earning about 10 cents per minute of labor .
 man wait until you hear about ada trolls ,  who are not even disabled ,  who come to small businesses with tape measures and start measuring doors ,  mirrors in bathrooms ,  curb height ,  etc .
 and then sue the businesses ,  but of course ,  they &apos;ll  &apos;settle out of court &apos; for the right amount .
 another business that we share a parking lot with got hit by these guys .
  the company that owns the business park had to redo the entire parking lot in order to get the width of the handicap spots exactly right ,  and i think they had to add a few more handicap spots as well .
  the business that got hit had to remodel their bathrooms and make a ton of other changes ,  all because their mirrors were 1 &apos; too high from the ground ,  or some other absurd issue .
 i &apos;m all for businesses being handicap friendly ,  but this was ridiculous ,  they are blatant legal trolls .
 large public schools have also been hit hard by ada complaints forcing many to take down websites completely .
  many schools use free websites such as google sites and which simply don &apos;t have the tools to comply with all the ada requirements .
  it was a good thing that it brought the issue to light in that they need to do everything they can to be complaint .
  however ,  if you were not 100% complaint to their standards you were still in-violation of the rules .
  many don &apos;t have the resources to create new sites that comply ,  so they just took them down and rely on facebook and twitter .
 that’s literally the reason they have it that way .
 so they can lay down the law on any arbitrary point they want .
 jokes on them ,  i &apos;ll just tell them i changed the tos back without telling them .
 when she gets older (than the cuttoff) send her books in the mail yourself .
 use media mail ,  or just wrap it up and stash it in the mailbox .
 she &apos;ll still love it and you can personally direct which books she gets .
 and for movies ,  kanopy may be free with your library card .
  5 free movies a month and unlimited use of “the great courses” videos .
 what are your settings ?
 that should be illegal .
 i paid for it ,  it &apos;s none of your business if i don &apos;t use it or not .
 i get it when it comes to taking up space (seat on a plane) ,  but goddamn how hard is it to email/call the customer to confirm ?
 well it &apos;s not a matter of some law making it illegal .
 customers are allowed to buy and not use part of their purchase .
 private businesses are also allowed to ban people from their services for any reason they want .
 well the dude is basically a professional redditor .
 he &apos;s in every single thread with top level comments multiple times .
 that’s what they do at the u .
 s capitol building ,  they have a tiny flagpole and a flag flies for like 5 seconds .
 it’s only a few weeks wait to get it back .
 once more for the people in the back please !
 i have my school  .
 edu email from 2001 still active and amazon started wanting current enrollment info a few years ago .
 so now i have to pay full price for prime ,  like some sort of savage .
 my school gives us 5tb of onedrive
 this makes me unreasonably angry .
 in my nursing program we had a somewhat similar situation a couple semesters back .
 we were told the only way to get the syllabus ,  and therefore all of our assignments ,  rubrics and book lists ,  was to purchase an $800 packet that contained the books we would need ,  the syllabus and about 30 printouts for assignments .
 we even had a two hour in-service from elsevier and they mentioned that $800 packet about fifty times in that time ,  just to make sure we knew about it .
 well ,  turns out the students from the semester prior to ours were the beta testers for that packet and they organized a fb group to let as many people know that we could: .
 have the book lists from them ,  for free ,  and therefore could buy each textbook at heavily discounted prices .
 they told us which books were utter shit ,  and which ones they found to replace the crap ones .
 and finally they told us that a week into the semester all of the syllabus and assignments became available online for free ,  but needed to be printed out from time to time .
 what a crock of fucking bullshit
 bizarrely even canada suffers from this problem despite supposedly being a more socialized country .
 my degree cost upwards $20000 before rent ,  food ,  insurance ,  student fees ,  bus passes ,  and so on .
 goodness ,  what you pay in tuition ,  i pay in books in the u .
 for 3 years at a university ,  i &apos;ll rack close to 30k ,  and i &apos;m at a cheaper school ,  with the goverment giving a pell grant that pays half my tuition .
  if i did my entire program there ,  it would be close to 45k .
 i went to a community college to complete my first two years ,  and my pell grant was enough covered the full cost .
 wow ,  i &apos;m glad someone finally said something lol .
 it &apos;s a friggin scam
 bram stoker &apos;s dracula on librevox made my drive from idaho to georgia 1000% less shitty .
 credit karma is great .
 i had about 5 grand worth of joint debt from a roommate skipping out on rent when i was younger .
 disputed it through ck ,  and it was gone within a month .
 i &apos;ve been living off-lease ,  under landlords noses since i was 18 because no one would rent to me .
 my score went up 120 points ,  and i &apos;ve since gotten it to 700 and rising .
 of course who else would i be
 upvote me to find out
 no ,  this is the second post here like this .
 i believe people are randomly getting 250 coins .
 my point is that this is costing them basically nothing because of the insanely low amount of money they were told to pay out .
 $31 million is less than 1% of their yearly revenue .
 it &apos;s less than 0 .
 5% of the company &apos;s total assets in exchange for exposing highly sensitive information of 147 million people ,  nearly half of the entire us .
 hey guys ,  chrisfix here
 i love it so much .
 i did an excel tutorial from a guy who spoke beautiful indian english .
 i found it much easier to pay attention .
 plus ,  he always talked a little bit about his family in between lessons ,  how for example his son had just taken his first steps .
 there is a youtuber ,  micheal reeves ,  that does code based projects for fun .
 videos like his get me into learning basic code vs just doing it .
 another good youtuber is simone giertz ,  different style but both might appeal to your child or you
 as an actual computer science student ,  i &apos;ve browsed around codeacademy before i got to coding in my classes and tbh found it very boring and basic .
 i think it &apos;s great syntactically ,  but definitely can get boring if you don &apos;t really practice what you learn with actual useful stuff .
 i &apos;ve found some inspiration from geeksforgeeks website as to what projects to do .
 if you already have coding background ,  it &apos;s always good to do some leetcode or codingbat (codingbat is way easier/beginner level imo) .
 the name of gimp is probably what holds it back .
 i had real trouble convincing the local library they didn &apos;t need to pay crazy money out to photoshop in some sort of subscription based setup they got talked in to .
 upon hearing the name of gimp they closed down my attempts to make it the image editor .
 also ,  all they were using photoshop for was scanning  not actual image editing .
 i eventually came up with a solution for them ,  but it didn &apos;t involve gimp .
 i was going to put gimp in its own comment ,  but then saw this and figured it would be better to have both options in a single comment chain so people could choose depending on their need .
 thanks for saying why to use one or the other .
 it &apos;s early here and my brain hasn &apos;t fully woken up enough to be able to explain things meaningfully
 gimp is more fully featured ,  but i tend towards paint .
 net for my simple image manipulations .
 you just made me realize it is possible to highlight sentences by triple clicking in a browser .
 guy sounds awesome
 remember when it was pepperidge-farms .
 wow ,  just searched and i had about $45 earmarked for me .
 i had an estranged grandmother pass away and i put in her name into her state &apos;s unclaimed property website .
 her estate and assets showed up and i &apos;m going to file a claim as an heir and see if i was still in her will or not .
 the state is asking for some annoying-to-do paperwork ,  but if i come out with anything ,  it was worth it in my book .
 sun microsystems was the primary sponsor of openoffice for ages .
 after oracle bought them ,  a bunch of the openoffice developers left and forked openoffice to libreoffice .
 eventually oracle donated openoffice to the apache foundation ,  but at this point it &apos;s basically effectively abandoned (the last major version ,  4 .
 libreoffice is still well maintained and the document foundation (the nonprofit they started to manage it) seems to be doing pretty well with it .
 i randomly got 500 the other day .
 and i haven &apos;t been redditing all that much recently .
 maybe they &apos;re trying to suck me back in .
 and the fact that they most dont announce which song they gonna play before it starts .
 hey mr dj ,  put a record on and shut the fuck up !
 professor leonard is also great ,  he is a college professor and records his lectures and posts them all on youtube .
  he has an entire playlist of calc 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  stats ,  algebra 1 .
  &apos;go with the guy with the best accent &apos; lmfao .
 would you like to buy an ltt fleece ?
 i &apos;m still not over mine ,  but one fact that helps me out a lot is thinking of the number 75 , 000 .
 there are 75 , 000 commercial flights per day ,  just in the us .
 not 75k per year .
 or 75k people total ,  but 75 , 000 times a day ,  a hundred or more people get in a metal tube and fly somewhere at 500 mph ,  40 , 000 feet above the ground .
 and for (last time i checked) ten years ,  day after day ,  75k times each and every day ,  all of those hundred or so people have made it to their destination safely .
 as it should be .
 here in the us the big companies making tax prep software basically got to write the law that the us government is actually banned from making their own online filing portal .
 in exchange ,  the companies must offer free filing for people making $69k and below  .
 but they do everything possible to keep that option difficult to find .
 you can file directly to the government the old fashioned way - with mail-in paper forms ,  but they are complicated and lengthy to fill out ,  especially if you have a mortgage ,  multiple income sources ,  investment gains ,  etc .
 honestly most of us are just stoked that somebody is interested in what we do .
 this was a top /r/todayilearned  or a /r/youshouldknow post at one point (i forget which) but it &apos;s worth repeating: scientists don &apos;t get any money from journal subscribers or people who buy articles .
  we &apos;re not trying to sell our science ,  and most of us don &apos;t give a flying fuck if the journal makes money off of our articles .
 our currency is mostly citations ,  so we care that more people see our work .
 thus the reason why many scientists distribute their work privately (or put it on scihub) .
 it &apos;s not strictly legal (and in many cases strictly illegal) but it &apos;s kinda one of those things like sharing netflix passwords in that everyone does it anyway .
 yeah i assume it wasn &apos;t the deaf community fighting this ,  it was a lawyer who found a way to shut it down .
 part of the reason people tend to hate lawyers and lobbyists
 i don’t see how taking up space on the plane has anything to do with it except for the airlines’ hideous practice of overselling flights .
 it’s the overselling that should be illegal .
 you should be able to pay the face value and buy every seat on a flight and have it fly empty if you have the money and the whim .
 it’s insane that the airlines claim the right sell more seats than they have just because a few people usually cancel .
 it is somewhat true ,  they can ban you for whatever reason they want as long as these reasons are not race ,  religion ,  gender and a few other things along those lines .
 i believe i have seen these two posts at least 3 times i  the last year .
 easy gold i would say .
 he &apos;s also an askreddit mod
 # canadians get a free canada flag that was flown on parliament hill .
 only a 40 year wait tho .
 if you get medicaid or ebt - you can get it for $6 per month !
 your anger is completely reasonable .
 this is just one more aspect of how our country fails those who are trying to better themselves .
 how did they get you out of it ?
 the information exposed is classified as confidential ,  one step below secret .
 don &apos;t forget your blinker fluid and soapy wudder !
 not gonna lie ,  i may have watched part of that same one lol .
 helen hunt - next of kin (1989 film) - ben stiller - madagascar (2005 film) - giraffe .
 i must be reediting wrong ,  i &apos;ve been updooting things this whole time .
 and the fact that they play two songs followed by 95 hours of commercials
 professor leonard   .
 that the dude with the big ole biceps ?
 professor leonard is a fucking g .
 patrick is great as well but professor leonard is awesome .
 that dude fucks ,  can &apos;t sing his praises loud enough .
 statistically safer than travelling by car
 interesting but more importantly i love your username lmao
 they should make their catalog available on the web
 i work for a place that just gives you the whole damn video and you caption the whole thing .
 generally pays 50-90 cents per minute captioned ,  depending on the video .
 there is also just plain audio transcription ,  but i don &apos;t do that work .
 i got a ton of pms from this !
 i &apos;m sending everyone that pm &apos;d me details on this .
 so if you want the details ,  be sure to pm me .
 i might not get to everyone today but i &apos;m trying to .
 i &apos;m pretty much just copy and pasting the same message to most of them .
 a little detail: yes ,  it is work from home and yes ,  you set your own hours .
 this job really ,  really helped me when i was in hard times .
 there have been two times in my life where i &apos;ve found myself suddenly and unexpectedly unemployed and ,  since i live in a rural area and there &apos;s not much need for i .
 personnel around me ,  it took a long time to find a job .
 i worked for this place full time while looking for a new job ,  and it was fantastic for me .
 i even talk about it in job interviews now :d anyway ,  if you are interested and you pm me ,   you will get the details .
 i hope you are accepted ,  and i wish you best of luck .
 i really hope it helps you as much as it &apos;s helped me :d
 what did he gain by shutting it down ?
 i mean ,  in theory ,  limiting access to knowledge for others allows you to rise up above the rest ,  but with the internet and all the other schools it &apos;s hard to argue shutting down berkeley &apos;s site would actually achieve that .
 i just don &apos;t get people who have it out for others .
 mine is just under $70 , 000 in ohio ,  usa .
 i have my bachelors and my masters .
 i’ll be dead before that all gets paid off
 credit karma helps guide you through disputing items on your credit reports .
 if a credit bureau doesn &apos;t respond to a dispute within 30 calendar days of receiving it ,  the fair credit reporting act requires the disputed item be removed from your report .
 credit bureaus are busy this time of year ,  so it &apos;s a good time to file some disputes if you have any .
 you can contest anything on your credit report ,  and they &apos;ll usually just remove it .
 until they get the same item reported again next month ,  then it goes right back on .
 that &apos;s essentially what all those  &apos;fix your credit &apos; scams do - they just dispute everything for you ,  and there &apos;s a pretty good chance that a decent percentage of them won &apos;t come back (because actual banks aside ,  who keeps reporting their deadbeats from five years ago ?
 i saw a sign at an auto repair shop that said  &apos;eye drops are technically blinker fluid &apos;
 considering how politically biased and inherently manipulative reddit is ,  this wouldn &apos;t surprise me at all .
 i’d keep an eye out bruh .
 epstein didn’t kill himself ,  and your into some big boy shit
 i &apos;m a cancer biologist and would love to do this for scientific videos .
 i feel like there are a ton of things that even algorithms get wrong in that realm
 it wasn &apos;t the lawyer it was another university who hired a lawyer .
 i guess they didn &apos;t like there being free courses .
 hurts their bottom line .
 yay for-profit universities !
 it &apos;s on their prime signup site ,  and they tell me that with a link every time i try to buy something without prime .
 absolutely scientific words are difficult as fuck to say/hear/write ,  and algorithms don &apos;t get to see them enough to learn .
 initially read as  &apos;difficult to fuck to &apos; ,  i &apos;m sure that is also true .
  &apos;uc berkeley has all these old lectures recorded ?
 not only is that a really cool thing ,  i can use these if i go there to augment my learning ,  review a topic ,  or just catch up on a lecture i missed !
 that makes me want to go to uc berkeley instead of other university !
  &apos; - prospective student .
 that &apos;s what the other university stopped by doing that .
 nah ,  talk science to me aww yeah that &apos;s so hot
 solar energy + desalination + gene therapy .
 all 7 of my honeybee colonies are currently surviving the winter ,  and today they’re bringing in the first pollen of the year .
 also ,  please support native bees (for why and how at home ,  check out: bringing nature home by douglas tallamy) ,  as well as butterflies like the monarch ,  and bats !
 the good news is often quiet and subtle .
  the bad news is always loud .
  i try to remember that .
  they handle a complex ,  globally interconnected society in ways  &apos;my &apos; generation (undergraduate at university in the 1970s) couldn &apos;t hold a candle to .
  any color ,  any sexual orientation ,  any (dis)ability ,  any nationality .
 it &apos;s all good ,  so long as they &apos;re not an asshole .
 we may be approximating dr .
 martin luther king &apos;s hope for a world where people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin .
 bee population is on the rise .
 if we could work together to save the bees ,  we can deal with climate change .
 i mean ,  i haven &apos;t heard much about isis recently .
 that &apos;s gotta be a good sign .
 advancements in medicine and gene therapy .
  the crispr technology has me very excited .
  also ,  the james webb space telescope is going to bring about many new discoveries .
 advancements in health studies and science for health has improved living conditions ten fold and continue to do so .
 so that makes me pretty optimistic .
 so much is unknown right now .
 excited to see what can come in the future .
 understanding of history .
 we are at a certain point in time ,  during which we are well aware of what happened in the past .
 this is a newly available ,  highly usefull feature of our generation .
 hopefully it lasts(censorship) .
 mental illness awareness is growing rapidly ,  and people are more and more willing to assist those in need .
 the fact that humanity is getting another mini space race going on .
 i’d love to see a man set foot on mars in my lifetime !
 that ,  and of course just getting to spend time with all my friends to play dungeons and dragons every week .
 ey im fine with my top comment being about d&d and space .
 lets do d&d in space bois .
 i &apos;m reminded of sam &apos;s speech to frodo in osgiliath in the two towers:  .
  &apos;it &apos;s like in the great stories mr .
 the ones that really mattered .
 full of darkness and danger they were ,  and sometimes you didn &apos;t want to know the end .
 because how could the end be happy ?
 how could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened ?
 but in the end ,  it &apos;s only a passing thing ,  this shadow .
 even darkness must pass .
 a new day will come .
 and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer .
 those were the stories that stayed with you ,  that meant something ,  even if you were too small to understand why .
 folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t .
 because they were holding on to something .
 that there’s some good in this world ,  mr .
 and it’s worth fighting for .
 shared collaborative projects like wikipedia proving that people are inherently good .
 people are beginning to realize that things don &apos;t change on their own .
 more people are taking action to help out and change the world as a whole .
 there &apos;s still people like you that donates like half of their money every year ,  or whatever .
 reruns of bob ross and mr rogers
 that every day millions of people go to work in order to provide for their families ,  come home ,  talk about inane things ,  etc .
  the world over consists mostly of people with similar wants and similar needs no matter from where they hail or what they look like ,  and the vast majority of the time it just _works_ .
  one tiny lapse in coordination and it could all come crumbling down ,  but mostly the world marches on .
  it &apos;s a brilliant blue ball of common humanity ,  and it pays to remember sometimes that for all that &apos;s horrible in the world ,  we &apos;re surrounded by a lot of good .
 i think we &apos;re making great progress with renewable energy and am hopeful that the my children &apos;s generation will have a chance to fix the mess we made !
 as someone with mental health issues ,  i love that the field is getting more attention and there &apos;s becoming less of a stigma of having a mental illness :)
 the plummeting price of solar and wind energy .
 thanks for the gold !
 i will be investing it in solar 
 i quit smoking today .
 this is the most peaceful time in human history .
  and it is getting better
 the better angels of our nature .
 and the fact a billionaire has a platform to communicate 1v1 with everyday people .
 thank you reddit .
 /r/upliftingnews exists ,  and it still gets content .
 we should be circulating good news rather than constantly refreshing bad news .
 internet forums like reddit ,  where a one line question can pump out a thousand nice answers ranging from global improvements to cat pictures in 30 minutes .
 also ,  my children and how they already have it better then i did when i was young .
 even though i didn &apos;t have that much problems back then either .
 keep on rocking as a great man ,  bill .
 the growing acceptance of people who are different .
 it might be a long slow battle ,  but we are moving in the right direction .
 a lot of people are saying spacex and elon musk without really expanding ,  so i will .
 commercial spaceflight - its literally here right now ,  but its going to get even cheaper in the future .
 the next step will be space tourism ,  but that won &apos;t be accessible to the average person for a few decades at least .
 space construction - we &apos;ve already done this with space stations ,  but cheaper commercial spaceflight will encourage larger buildings in space .
 instead of launching completed modules like we have in the past ,  we &apos;re going to be launching subdivisions of modules that will dwarf even the iss .
 i &apos;m incredibly optimistic about whatever happens to be the  &apos;next iss &apos; .
 asteroid mining - this one we probably won &apos;t see in our lifetimes ,  (unless the futurists are right ,  and the first person to live to 200 is alive today) .
 however ,  the potential of asteroid mining is astronomical !
 there are individual asteroids with more platinum and tungsten on them than the entire earth has available .
 once we have these materials in excess ,  who knows what new developments we &apos;ll see .
 aluminum used to be exceedingly difficult to refine and rare .
 once a reliable refining process was developed ,  we found a myriad of uses for aluminum that changed the world .
 i predict we &apos;ll see similar benefits from improved access to rare metals found abundantly in asteroids .
 space tourism - now that we &apos;ve got commercial spaceflight ,  and space construction is on the horizon ,  space tourism will become a booming industry .
 i &apos;d be excited to spend a week on a luxury space station in the future .
 mars - we &apos;re definitely going at some point ,  whether it is publicly or privately funded .
 i doubt there are any monsters there ,  or that we &apos;ll have any visitors forced to grow potatoes with their excrement .
 however ,  mars is the next logical destination for humanity &apos;s domination of the solar system .
 i hope i live to see the first colonization effort !
 the constant technological advancement we &apos;re seeing right now ,  especially in fields like medicine .
  giving away so much money is truly commendable ,  and i thank you for it .
 the fact we still are allowed to have negative headlines .
 my girl scout troop .
 they bring me hope that the future generation gives a shit .
 whenever there &apos;s a grim news story i always remember mr .
 rodgers &apos;s mother &apos;s advice .
 i look for the helpers .
 it &apos;s a great reminder that people are inherently good and human ingenuity will get us where we need to go .
 i &apos;m three months pregnant after the second round of ivf .
 the fact that my wife and i are going to have a baby together makes me ridiculously optimistic about our future .
 marijuana legalization for the usa which will reduce crime and non-violent offenders in prison ,  as well as a host of other widespread positive effects .
 the fact that bill fucking gates is taking the time to make an askreddit thread
 that video of a crow and a kitten who are friends
 medical science breakthroughs in alzheimer &apos;s and dementia .
 refocusing on space exploration .
 the future applications of automation and 3d printing .
 our increasing ability to share more complex ideas over greater distances in shorter spans of time .
 eta: renewable energy !
 realizing that bill gates is the op ,  meaning we can have personal conversations with people who used to be outside our reach .
 the world is getting smaller .
 ultrasound with the wife thursday !
 i am hopeful that microsoft will one day bring clippy back into microsoft word .
 i was born with a very rare muscle illness and am rooting very hard for a cure on a genetic level .
 that is why i participate in any study that is thrown my way by doctors .
 reading headlines on research going into human trials is very exciting and gives me great hope for the future .
 israel is now a net exporter of fresh water due to desalination technology .
 more people are actually choosing to believe proven sciences .
 working with people directly ,  i noticed a lot of them are good ,  generous ,  honest and benevolent people .
 these people give me the drive i need to handle things ,  because i know ,  we can shape a better future for the people ,  animals ,  and the planet .
 knowledge of the past .
 humanity has made more progress towards giving people longer and better quality of life globally in the last 150 years ,  than has occurred in the rest of human history .
 commercialized space travel !
 i am optimistic that the younger generation is more progressive than my fathers was .
  &apos;ah man ,  i got cancer .
 can &apos;t come to work today ,  boss .
 oh boy imagine the price: 1million per injection .
 “one of the agents is already approved for use in humans while the other has been tested for human use in several unrelated clinical trials ,  according to stanford school of medicine .
 my dad has stage four lung cancer ,  which is inoperable .
 he’s done some chemo but it’s damaging his body a lot .
 i’m trying to find more information on if/how he can get these treatments or clinical trials .
 does anyone happen to have further information on this ?
 the articles i’ve found don’t say what these drugs are called or where the trials are being done .
 let’s hope this can brighten and save the lives of thousands of people every day .
 i am glad you are sticking around !
 this really made me smile ,  because my experience is very similar .
 it’s an incredible realization ,  and i’m so happy for and proud of you .
 and i &apos;m going to fix mine ,  dammit !
 i really love your  &apos;fuck you &apos; attitude toward your life &apos;s problems .
 it may seem trivial ,  but that attitude reflects a change in beliefs .
 it shows you believe you are ultimately in control of your life ,  and that can make all the difference in the world .
 using gene therapy to build a human that can drink salt water and use sun light like a plant ?
 yes i await the day as well .
 just watched a documentary about the chinese undercutting the honey market by skimming product .
 keep making the good stuff ,  buddy !
  &apos;our headlines are splashed with crime yet for every criminal there are 10 , 000 honest ,  decent ,  kindly men .
 if it were not so ,  no child would live to grow up .
 business could not go on from day to day .
 decency is not news .
 it is buried in the obituaries ,  but is a force stronger than crime &apos;
 as someone who works in a news organisation ,  thank you for giving me this perspective .
 i truly appreciate it .
 the death of the american chesnut is also partially responsible for the severity with which the great depression struck appalachia .
 chesnuts were a primary food supply for backup reserves in the form of herds of pigs that were allowed free roam .
 the pigs could be sold or slaughtered to keep families afloat during hard times .
 the disappearance of the chesnuts killed the viability of the pig heards ,  causing the economic failsafe to collapse ecologically at the same time that the great depression made monetary reserves worthless .
 where can i order a good sapling ?
 i just hope there aren &apos;t too many invasive species to choke it out .
  us americans like our space !
 aww ,  you had me all excited about planting one in my back yard but i just saw that the american chestnut foundation sold out of saplings for 2018 last week :(
 let &apos;s start reintroduction .
 that tree supported a huge wildlife ecology .
 what happened to them ,  and how are they possibly returning ?
 i have been recently diagnosed with stage ii astrocytoma (cancer of the brain and spinal cord) .
 studies like this make me happy for our younger generations that they might not have to see so much suffering .
 thank you for sharing ,  i needed a lift up and you provided .
 i am very sorry for your losses .
 be well and eat those veggies !
 i see the same thing in my students .
 i teach preschool and today a little boy whose parents are from somalia ,  a little boy who was born in kyrgyzstan ,  a little boy from peru ,  and a little girl whose parents are from mexico built a castle together .
 they don’t care what color you are or where you’re from .
 they just like building together .
 i almost posted this: .
 teenagers make me hopeful ,  as odd as it sounds .
 they care about others ,  diversity ,  and our planet .
 i remember ,  in the mid-90s ,  a developmentally disabled young man quitting school because of the bullying he received .
 he was on my bus route ,  in a rural part of the us ,  and lived in poverty .
 i tell my students about him ,  and about how others treated him ,  and ,  shamefully ,  about how the rest of us looked away instead of stopping the torment .
 the reactions from all of them ,  even in the same rural and high-poverty county ,  were shock and horror .
 “how did you let that happen ?
 why didn’t you stand up to that ?
 ” it’s hard to have no answers for my teenage self .
 but their love of kids who are different makes me know that it’s getting better .
 i see them saying hi to the kids with special needs in the hall ,  sitting with them at lunch ,  having friends who are part of the lgbtq community ,  and loving those whose skin tones are not the same as theirs .
 we are raising a generation who are sensitive to diversity in spite of our earlier missteps .
 i take hope in that ,  pride in their commitment to acceptance ,  and it is humbling and a challenge to me to continue to identify my biases and work to change those negative thought patterns .
 i hope we can deal with climate change ,  but it is a much bigger problem than the bees ,  mostly because the bees aren &apos;t costing anyone billions of dollars .
 they no longer control anything meaningful anymore; they &apos;re just your garden variety terrorist group now .
 should we start calling them waswas ?
 thanks a lot ,  linda .
 they &apos;ve lost pretty much all significant territory .
 doesn &apos;t really matter though ,  isis was a sympton ,  not a cause .
 that &apos;s not a good thing .
 sadly ,  archer hasn &apos;t been the same since they changed the name .
 it feels like we haven &apos;t had a huge discovery recently ,  hopefully we get something big within a decade or so .
 as people have pointed out ,  we have made some significant discoveries recently
 i’m so fucking excited for the james webb space telescope .
 i have been excited ever since i was a kid ,  and i saw the space shuttle mission to repair the hubble telescope .
 i’m also somewhat anxious that something will happen to it during launch .
 i have one of those “invisible” illnesses so you’d never know how sick i am at first glance .
 i have glaucoma ,  osteonecrosis ,  & had a stroke in high school .
 when i tell ppl i don’t want to have kids to avoid passingly my bad genes they think i’m crazy but if my kid would be guaranteed healthy i’d consider kids .
 each day we get closer and closer to genetically engineered catboys .
 no one lives forever ,  no one .
 but with advances in modern science and my high level income ,  it &apos;s not crazy to think i can live to be 245 ,  maybe 300 .
 eta: this is a quote from talladega nights .
 i’m not being serious :)
 if things go as expected ,  the next few decades will yield some really incredible advances in healthcare .
 regenerative medicine ,  autologous cell therapies ,  and of course crispr-based genetic engineering could really be massive .
 and that doesn &apos;t even include medical devices !
 watched falcon heavy launch the other week and was amazed for the first time in a long time .
 checkout the following youtube channels: .
 crash course world history  .

 world war 1 channel .
 i love you back (not a channel but i &apos;m really feeling your comment)
 imma get some laser eyes !
 i could use a liver !
 but all jokes aside ,  best of luck to you and your organs .
 technology is amazing .
 i have two ,  what &apos;s your price ?
 also ,  crowd-sourcing organ donation a la kidney exchange is making it easier to get kidneys the traditional way .
 the idea of creating a scaffold for an organ using  non-antigenic cartilage and then introducing the host’s cells onto that scaffold to grow a new organ is mind .
 it essentially makes it much more likely that the organ will not be rejected by the host body’s immune system .
 humans are awesome sometimes .
 not only that ,  but people with mental illness are become less and less ashamed of said illnesses and actually seeking out help .
 stigma goes both ways .
 stop bringing up gun politics on my comment you god damned vultures
 literally just talked about this with a sweet old man at a cafe today !
 he seemed a bit lonely so we chatted for a while .
 he must have been at least 80 .
 turns out he has bipolar ,  which was out of control for most of his life .
 but in the last two decades ,  he said he &apos;s seen a massive positive change in the uk national health service .
 there is now much better treatment offers and understanding for the mentally ill .
 he now hasn &apos;t had a bad episode for 15 years .
 he &apos;s stable on medication ,  and maintains his health with regular checkups and a peer support programme .
 i work in mental health (and i also bipolar ,  currently stable) ,  so i always see the flaws in the system .
 but he &apos;s right that a lot of progress has been made .
 just signed up for my first initial consultation earlier today for monday .
 i have my weekly dnd game tonight !
 it &apos;s the highlight of my week that i always look forward to :) roll for initiative !
 i also think on these two quotes when looking to be optimistic about the world: .
 “some believe it is only great power that can hold evil in check ,  but that is not what i have found .
 it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay .
 small acts of kindness and love .
 why bilbo baggins ?
 perhaps because i am afraid ,  and he gives me courage .
 “when i was a boy and i would see scary things in the news ,  my mother would say to me ,  ‘look for the helpers .
 you will always find people who are helping .
  to this day ,  especially in times of ‘disaster , ’ i remember my mother’s words and i am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers — so many caring people in this world .
 “i can’t carry the ring mr .
 but i can carry you .
 ya know ,  i &apos;ve had a really shitty couple of weeks and was ready to give up on something ,  this helped a lot .
 this reminds me nicely of a quote from the grapes of wrath .
 the last clear definite function of man — muscles aching to work ,  minds aching to create beyond the single need — this is man .
 to build a wall ,  to build a house ,  a dam ,  and in the wall and house and dam to put something of manself ,  and to manself take back something of the wall ,  the house ,  the dam; to take hard muscles from the lifting ,  to take the clear lines and form from conceiving .
 for man ,  unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe ,  grows beyond his work ,  walks up the stairs of his concepts ,  emerges ahead of his accomplishments .
 this you may say of man — when theories change and crash ,  when schools ,  philosophies ,  when narrow dark alleys of thought ,  national ,  religious ,  economic ,  grow and disintegrate ,  man reaches ,  stumbles forward ,  painfully ,  mistakenly sometimes .
 having stepped forward ,  he may slip back ,  but only half a step ,  never the full step back .
 this you may say and know it and know it .
 this you may know when the bombs plummet out of the black planes on the market place ,  when prisoners are stuck like pigs ,  when the crushed bodies drain filthily in the dust .
 you may know it in this way .
 if the step were not being taken ,  if the stumbling-forward ache were not alive ,  the bombs would not fall ,  the throats would not be cut .
 fear the time when the bombs stop falling while the bombers live — for every bomb is proof that the spirit has not died .
 and fear the time when the strikes stop while the great owners live — for every little beaten strike is proof that the step is being taken .
 and this you can know — fear the time when manself will not suffer and die for a concept ,  for this one quality is the foundation of manself ,  and this one quality is man ,  distinctive in the universe .
 of all the characters in lotr i like sam &apos;s ending the most .
 aragorn becomes a king ,  gimli ,  and legolas lead lives of adventure ,  frodo goes with the elves and gandalf .
 sam goes back to the shire ,  grows potatoes ,  and tell his kids about mr .
 frodo ,  just like he said he would .
 sean astin shined in that speech ,  i cry every time
 you can &apos;t just drop samwise gamgee on a thread like that .
 it &apos;s not just any inspiring speech ,  ya know ?
 that man is an inspiration .
 i &apos;m in tears right now
 i have a neuropace in my brain to help control seizures .
 responsive neuro stimulation .
 i &apos;m on the first few steps of transhumanism and i wake up every day realizing that this cutting edge technology in my skull will one day be the  &apos;pegleg &apos; of neurological procedures .
 press forth my friend .
 it’s great to hear that you are so passionate about the intersection of health and technology .
 to me ,  the ability of science to prevent and cure disease is magical .
 last year i saw some amazing work at the cdc using virtual reality to help develop a universal flu vaccine .
 i &apos;m a computer engineer ,  and have always sucked at biology and chemistry ,  but holy fuck medicine is cool
 my dad just had an operation to clear out his sinuses .
 the last time he had one 30 years ago it took 14 hours and he had to stay overnight in the hospital at least one night .
 this time it took a little over an hour and he was home that afternoon .
 having waited through both i was thrilled at all the advances that have been made !
 wikipedia- you &apos;re welcome college students .
 wikipedia has substantial problems but in terms of time it only took 0 .
 5% of america &apos;s yearly television consumption to get the encyclopedia to where it was in 2008 or 2010 ,  i forget which .
 just let that sink in for a moment .
 forget the problems for a moment .
 half a percent of our annual tv consumption created a massive aggregation of summaries and citations of human knowledge .
 what could we do with 1% of focused human effort ?
 just sat through a domestic abuse/violence seminar this morning .
 i can certainly appreciate that we as world people can see an issue ,  and raise the red flag and wave it vigorously .
 no more of this “well ,  that’s just the way it is” business .
 rape ,  abuse-whether child or partner ,  racism ,  discrimination ,  etc .
 we are able to stand up and say ,  “hell naw-shit ain’t happening on my watch .
 there is help out there .
 you’re be problem ?
 there are so many avenues now that are there to help any problem you may be having .
 everyone has problems .
 that’s the only thing that stays the same .
 it’s important that we recognize this ,  and put aside our pride and get help .
 and that is what makes me have hope for the future .
 it’s easier than ever before ,  in the history of the world ,  and it will continue to get easier !
 when that promo started my first thought was ,  “no way the boat can travel that far so fast !
 the more people travel ,  the more compassion and open mindedness they have .
 people complain  &apos;flying sucks because you &apos;re not waited on hand and foot anymore like in the 50 &apos;s &apos; .
 yeh ,  and tickets don &apos;t cost $5 , 000 to get to la anymore ,  suck it up .
 a fist bumb is a fist bump that &apos;s so energetic it leaves your fist numb .
 i donated to wikipedia for the first time last year .
 3 bucks is close to half of what i make .
 got drunk one night and watched some bob ross on netflix and it was a revelation ,  man .
 it &apos;s impossible to feel bad when you &apos;re watching him paint .
 i guess that &apos;s why they called it the joy of painting .
 time for a fusion show .
 i just wish this were more reflected on a geopolitical scale .
 if nation states spent more money on cooperation instead of invasion of each other so much good could come from it .
 my friend once had an unstable man try to attack her in a coffee shop bathroom .
 she screamed and about 10 men went running to help her .
 she got away safely and the men surrounded the guy until the cops showed up .
 there will always be bad in the world ,  but most people are trying their best to be good and jump at the chance to help .
 this reminds me of the misleading statistic that more and more people are dying of cancer every year .
 only cause they &apos;re not dying of other stuff like minor illnesses/violence etc .
 life expectancy and general health will shoot up tremendously if we can find a more reliable cure for cancer
 sadly ,  the media doesn &apos;t report uplifting news as much as it should ,  because reporting  &apos;four dead in mass shooting &apos; gets far more clicks than  &apos;man saves lives of four people .
 a relative of mine checked into a mental hospital yesterday for depression and bipolar disorder .
 the amount of support he received from friends and family was very encouraging .
 i myself have mental illness too .
 i remember the first time seeing a commercial for mental health awareness and it had glenn close and some other celebrities .
 i remember feeling goosebumps thinking that maybe one day soon the stigma would dissipate .
 i still think we are very misunderstood but it takes all of us to fight the stigma !
 it &apos;s a relief that mental health is being taken more seriously .
 i believe that my sisters and i will be the end of our family &apos;s cycle of mental illness and abuse .
 acknowledging the impact that untreated mental health illnesses has is important and will i hope i can help others along the way .
 i hope someone has sent you a nice spiderman op :)
 in australia there has been incredible penetration of solar power in the last 10 years ,  all driven by the economics of solar power .
 in the last 10 years .
 well ,  2018 is even better than the last 10 years in terms of prices ,  pay-off periods; and sales of solar panels have reflected that .
 people are installing their panels en-masse with zero subsidies .
 businesses big and small ,  covering their roofs .
 it is so crazy ,  there may be a glut of power in sa (when the sun shines ,  at least)( sa=south australia ,  thx /u/royalhghnss) ,  in as few as 5 years time ,  considering the rate of growth .
 on one sunday ,  a few months ago ,  50% of all power in sa was generated by rooftop solar alone: that &apos;s not even including wind and other large-scale renewables (we dont have hydro in sa) .
 the magic of all this is that it only took a few years of government investment .
 the market has ramped up ,  partly in thanks to those subsidies ,  we are reaping benefits ,  and we will be for years to come .
 i quit last month after smoking for 20 years .
 couldn’t be happier !
 keep it up ,  you got this !
 quitting smoking is easy ive done it hundreds of times
 it &apos;s because op is bill gates .
 best of luck to your mum
 i think the fact that in 7 minutes there is already 300 comments about good things really says alot about us .
 you just gave bill gates an answer from bill gates .
 you know ,  with all the cynicism and the stories that the media put out these days ,  it almost feels like humans are failing .
 for example ,  i can’t count the number of times someone has said ‘i’ve lost faith in humanity’ after watching something like black mirror ,  but we really don’t realize that we are probably living in the best time and that humanity as a whole is improving .
 we are not getting worse ,  and stats like these strongly suggest that .
 the best is yet to come ,  and we will get there .
 to all those who think i’m shitting on black mirror: i don’t necessarily think it’s a bad show .
 i think it serves as a good warning and food for thought (spawning critical thought and such) ,  but i do think many people also get a wrong message from it .
 i don’t think that’s the shows fault though .
 i was just using it as an example .
 thx u/the_popcorn_pisser for pointing that idea out .
 edit2: some people are pointing out (rightfully) that blind optimism and blind cynicism are both bad .
 i agree ,  and this post i made isn’t an attempt to be complacent .
 we still have a ways to go ,  i’m just trying to call out blind cynicism .
 thx u/redherringdetected and u/discontentanon for pointing this out
 these are some incredible statistics !
 i had no idea of most of them .
 it would be great if you could include some sources or further reading material—but i &apos;ll be doing a bit of research regardless .
 thanks ,  my day is looking up already :)
 i’m glad that you found this list .
 if i could use only one number that proves how life is getting better ,  it would be the first one – 122 million .
 i wish more people knew about this mind-blowing success .
 thanks for sharing it here !
 the better angels of our nature is the best book i &apos;ve ever read .
 i &apos;ve never had something completely change the way i view the world .
 it puts everything into perspective .
 usually those headlines bring you down while bringing you up .
 dog recovers from years of abuse .
 mother jailed after torturing children
 picture or no pup         .
 top ever comment on puppers ,  no regrets 
 that &apos;s a weird name for a dog .
 everyone is a weirdo and i love weirdos 
 furthermore ,  people are beginning to realize that we’re not all that different .
 skin color ,  or eye shape ,  or religious views and whatever else have you don’t make you different: everyone just varies the norm .
 it takes all kind of people to make a world .
 oh shit that was bill gates .
 no wonder it &apos;s #1 in 20 minutes
 it &apos;s honestly heartwarming to see a man with incredible amounts of money devote himself so fully to the advancement of society .
 this comment is very underrated .
 as long as the bad news are still news ,  it &apos;s all good .
 not to mention undercutting cartels .
 seriously someone close to me lives in near constant pain .
 i am absolutely certain that marijuana would help her but it &apos;s still illegal in my state .
 my hope and dream is that in 10 years weed would be legal in all 50 states .
 even for somebody who &apos;s disinterested in marijuana such as me ,  this is still a great thing imo because it &apos;s more personal freedom ,  and much less tax dollars spent on incarcerating people for a pointless cause .
 hey isnt he that guy who created microsoft ?
 whats he doing on reddit
 can &apos;t wait to see another  &apos;leaking again xd &apos; post on the rs reddit 
 i kind of want a clippy pixar movie .
 i decided to go this route several months ago .
 i even log into facebook a lot less ,  and i &apos;ve never been more satisfied with my life .
 the launch of falcon heavy gave me goosebumps .
 i found it amazing that the landing of rocket boosters now feels routine everytime i watch it
 young people seem to be either more progressive than my generation &apos;s progressives or more right wing than my generation &apos;s conservatives (i &apos;m an older  &apos;millennial &apos;) .
 they seem more polarized and extreme in general .
 it &apos;s deeply unsettling .
 at least they &apos;re politically active ,  i suppose .
 pshh go get your shit and get in here !
 i swear i will remember this comment if it becomes a thing !
 nah ,  that was the cure for hiv .
 its actually relatively cheap .
 i didn &apos;t see that anyone got back to you but as someone who works in clinical trials your best bet would be to contact the pharmaceutical companies or the university groups who can point you in the right direction .
 i &apos;m not sure what type your father has but i know astrazeneca are doing some lung cancer trials .
 as the article in this is so new i doubt they have fully functional trials right now ,  they generally take years to setup .
 the best case is that they have some phase 1s on healthy volunteers .
 like i say have a look at the big pharmas ,  novartis ,  j&j ,  astrazeneca ,  pfizer ,  lilly ,  etc .
 see if they have anything that would be suitable and they should have contact information .
  &apos;jim that &apos;s just grass .
 people drastically underestimate how much we should be saying  &apos;go bees &apos; ,  .
 this is really beautiful ,  what is it from ?
 this sounds like a dissertation
 why did they dissapear ?
 and i think it &apos;s also an important lesson (that has maybe not been learned) for western politicians who are being lobbied by lumber companies to cut down huge swaths of forest before they are destroyed by bark beetles .
 bark beetles are devastating ,  yes ,  and they render the forest dry and fire-prone with a bunch of dead timber .
  but among all those millions of trees ,  there are certainly some resistant ones .
  we &apos;ll only find them if we let nature take its course (without clear-cutting all of the rockies .
 omg dude ,  don’t even get me started on invasive species .
 spent a year in americorps trying to get rid of reed canary grass ,  english ivy ,  himalayan blackberry ,  nightshade ,  yellow flag iris ,  etc .
 only to have them spring up again ,  fighting to create a monoculture ,  trying to destroy the biodiversity of all the trees and shrubs we poured our literal blood ,  sweat ,  and tears into planting all winter .
 the war never ends .
 and then i go to college and my environmental studies professor has the audacity to defend the buggers !
 i just about burst a blood vessel .
 blight (fungus) introduced from chinese chestnuts first part of the 20th century .
 it &apos;s estimated that 3-4 million trees were wiped out .
 new trees would constantly start back up but wouldn &apos;t live long .
 the asian bark fungus was nearly 100% lethal .
 scientists have ,  through gene modification ,  created a 95% american chestnut tree using genes from the asian chestnut ,  which has a resistance to the fungus .
  they &apos;ve been working on this for years .
 and apparently they &apos;ve been successful .
 stay strong friend !
 if you haven &apos;t already been there ,  r/cancer is an awesome support sub .
  we are there for you if you need us .
 (i know this thread is old) .
 if this was a scene in a 1990s cartoon ,  people would say it &apos;s  &apos;forced &apos; and  &apos;unrealistic &apos; to push diversity .
 but there we have it in real life .
 good kids being great with each other
 why do we even have that garden‽‽‽
 good work linda .
 they’ve not had territory in iraq since 2017 .
  i think they’re on their last gasps in syria too .
 isis is nothing now .
 yeah ,  but it was a pretty awful symptom that has been mitigated .
 its something to celebrate when your fever goes away even if the virus is still giving you a runny nose .
 i &apos;ve just finished the first season ,  and i &apos;ve gotta say the name does seem out of place .
 i wanted an isis vs isis episode .
 possibly mallory trying to sue or attack the terrorists over stealing their name .
 idk man ,  evidence of the higgs boson and the gravitational wave detection from ligo were both pretty big news .
 the search for truth is slow and methodical .
 they say the first human who will live to 150 has already been born .
 i believe i am that human .
 i just realized bill gates was the one who asked this question .
 thanks bill ,  for all the karma .
 heck ,  i just read in the newspaper that they put a pig heart in some guy from russia .
 do you know what that means ?
 wow ,  that &apos;s a lot of responses that seem to think i was serious .
 it &apos;s a continuation of the quote the parent comment made .
 those that continued the quote - \m/
 i &apos;m really hoping that genetic engineering can stop and reverse aging enough so that we could live for 10 , 000+ years
 are we about to get it on ?
 crispr was definitely my answer to this question !
 so many possibilities in the medical field from  &apos;curing &apos; aging to stopping the appearance of diseases like alzheimer &apos;s and even cancer !
 scientists are already breeding mosquitoes that can &apos;t transmit malaria and releasing them into the wild to spread their genes .
 it is a huge step forward in stopping one of the most deadly diseases in human history .
 i don’t think they’ve actually released any mosquitoes into the wild yet .
 more likely into small controlled populations of non engineered mosquitoes to test the spread of the resistance throughout the population .
 i literally screamed and cheered watching falcon heavy like i would at a football game .
  it was amazing to witness .
 i saw the one launch from california the other day .
 i’ve been huge into space and sci-fi my whole life .
  however pathetic it sounds ,  star trek (every series) has been a colossal part of my life .
 but i’d never seen a rocket before .
 so i heard the falcon was taking off two hours away and i thought it’d be amazing if i could catch a quick glimpse of it before work that morning .
 because even though it’s two hours away ,  i figured i still might be able to see it from los angeles .
  since it was so big and going so far up .
 so i stepped outside my apartment and walked a bit down the street until i had a better view of the sky .
  i was facing the general direction of where i knew it was taking off from and had the live stream on my phone .
 countdown ,  liftoff ,  i’m searching the skies for it .
  but i can’t see it .
  i figured maybe there was too much fog in the atmosphere or it was too far or— there it is !
 way off in the distance ,  but still clear as day ,  the rocket flying up with the huge burst of red flames behind it .
 i stood there on the sidewalk watching in amazement until it faded away into the blue sky .
  people were walking past me ,  cars going about their business ,  nobody looking up and checking out this incredible thing .
 it was mind blowing .
  one of these days i’m going to drive to a good viewing point near the launch site and watch it from closer .
 imma be a repoman !
 i already can find listings for laser eye surgeons in my city .
 i just want a bionic eye to replace the one i lost during a brain surgery .
 i lived 15 years with complete eyesight ,  now i want it back .
 plus ,  you know  .
 how fucking awesome would a robot eye be
 yeah these stem cell doctors better hurry their asses up because my liver can &apos;t take this kind of alcohol  punishment forever .
 about tree fiddy ?
 i wish i was born 200 years in the future ,  or could at least visit .
 i &apos;m really interested to see how much changes and if we have huge health leaps .
 seems like we &apos;re a century away from being able to live for much ,  much longer and age much slower .
 i feel like we &apos;re going to eventually have immersion rooms where it &apos;s all virtual reality with no headgear .
 just these worlds you can touch and interact with .
 and then nobody ever leaves their room again .
 because they &apos;re banging their crush and flying a plane in their immersion room .
 god i &apos;ll never forget the day i called off at work because my anxiety was flaring up hard .
 my bosses took it seriously ,  sent me a nice email saying they understood it was serious and thanking me for how hard i was working .
 they &apos;ve got my loyalty for life because they took it seriously .
 i have mine tonight also .
 im just going to assume that you &apos;re a member of my party .
 all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us .
 i love listening to this quote because i always immediately go ,   &apos;and i now decide to spend the next 9 hours of my time watching the rest of the trilogy on a tv screen .
 that last one was my senior quote 
 the second quote reminds me a lot of the boston bombing .
 how it simultaneously showed us man at his worst and at his best .
 his worst because some sick individual decided to maim and kill innocent people .
 the best because people put themselves in harms way to help total strangers .
 some of them literally went the extra mile by running somewhere to donate blood for the injured .
 where &apos;s the second one from ?
 i can &apos;t quite recall .
 i &apos;m currently researching poverty and they say that one of the biggest things that determines the crime levels of a street in a city ,  is how much its residents care about it via an unspoken social contract .
 i also read that the best way to support a democracy and fight tyranny or fascism is to care and have hobbies .
 say hello to people on the street .
 it &apos;s those little ,  tiny things ,  that creates a healthy social network ,  community ,  and democracy .
 about ten years ago i was diagnosed with a irregular cornea on one eye (that topmost layer) .
 the doctors said that a transplant was not advisable at the time ,  but told me  &apos;to come back in 10 years &apos; as progress was made .
 i checked back 2 years ago ,  and truthfully ,  transplants were now well developed .
 1 year later ,  i got a new cornea .
 it still can &apos;t grasp that a field can move so fast !
 i have a implantable cardioverter defibrillator in my chest .
 weird to think it is always keeping an eye on my heart rhythm and once a year it wirelessly connects to a box in my bedroom and uploads info to the hospital .
 we are the early day cyborgs my friend .
 though yours sounds like a way more high tech bit of kit than mine .
 just remember to use the sources given in the wikipedia page ,  not wiki itself as your reference .
 wikipedia- you &apos;re welcome insert pretty much anyone here
 and yet my commute still takes 90 min in friday rush hour traffic .
 self-driving cars can &apos;t come fast enough .
 wow i’d actually never thought of this .
 i can’t think of any travelers i’ve met who’ve been rude or close minded .
 i mean i’m sure they still exist but it’s such a cool and wholesome thought :)
 i started travelling a few years ago ,  you realize that we &apos;re all just people .
 doesn &apos;t matter what race or where we &apos;re from ,  we &apos;re all just doing the best we can .
 was flying really that expensive ?
 i didn’t notice until i saw a comment that said “hi bill” and even then i first thought the person must just have bill in their name .
 happy little trees .
 bob ross is my hero .
 i fall asleep to his reruns all the time .
 so two weeks ago on wednesday i watched mr .
 rodgers &apos; neighborhood on a whim .
 one episode on youtube .
 he had a sock puppet character on there who was afraid of going to school because he doesn &apos;t know everything yet .
 for a lot of personal reasons that span my entire life on this earth ,  i cried for the rest of the episode .
 couldn &apos;t even watch another one right then ,  it tore me up too bad .
 so now i &apos;m trying to sit down for one episode after work every day .
 i haven &apos;t made it every day ,  but that &apos;s ok because i know fred doesn &apos;t mind .
 it &apos;s been having a pretty huge impact on me .
 i &apos;m less irritable ,  driving is less frustrating ,  and i hate my mornings a lot less .
 there &apos;s something amazing about that guy .
 he and bob ross are both something special .
 isnt bob &apos;s burgers a thing ?
 i &apos;d say we are experiencing an age where the vast majority of nations do just that .
 sure what is happening in syria is terrible and there are several other nations in some of the poorest least connected parts of the world that operate on a similar level but on the whole war and invasion are becoming obsolete as all the nations of the world who are connected both through trade ,  technology and culture find it incomprehensible to invade one another .
 sure bad actors like russia try and circumvent that through dog and pony shows like what they did in georgia and ukraine ,  and china challenges other nations autonomy by invading the ocean ,  but on the whole since the second world war and especially the fall of the soviet union more and more countries are spending money on cooperation ,  and most of the money spent on the military by these nations is meant for defense of this new world not invasion .
 so thinking of it like that makes me optimistic about the future .
 sure it could all go wrong just like it did in 1914 but i believe that on a deeper fundamental level we are all more connected and its those countries that refuse to join this new world that cause the conflict not the great powers anymore .
 i read every response before scrolling up and seeing it &apos;s bill gates .
 right there with you space whale .
 he linked to it from the ama he just finished
 don &apos;t leave us hanging .
 more clicks than  &apos;man saves lives of four people .
 vaccine saves lives of forty thousand people .
 i checked into a mental hospital last year for depression and anxiety .
 the amount of support from the doctors ,  therapists and staff was wonderful !
 my psychiatric helped get me on the right medication and made me realize it &apos;s ok to ask for help .
 i was so scared to go but i &apos;m so so thankful i did .
 my therapist once told me ,   &apos;breaking the cycle of abuse will be one of the most important and proudest accomplishments in your life &apos; .
 i &apos;m very proud of you and your sisters as well 3
 i &apos;m in a class called abnormal psychology and many of the students have had experiences with their own disorders .
 it &apos;s funny how we &apos;ll talk to each other so casually about ourselves ,  like i &apos;ll say  &apos;good morning !
 started on an ssri a couple weeks ago ,  it &apos;s working so well for my gad &apos; and she &apos;ll reply  &apos;oh that &apos;s so awesome !
 i remember medication worked so well of my ocd .
 it &apos;s so casual and light ,  and such a new experience for me .
 nothing but acceptance and sharing our journeys 3
 cries in american
 three years quit as of last month ,  after about 30 years .
 ah ,  didn &apos;t even see that !
 it &apos;s looking hopeful ,  they &apos;ve caught it very early
 at first i thought you were joking but then i looked at op &apos;s profile and holy shit !
 til bill gates is a karma whore ,  not happy with him only getting kajillions of upvotes for his ama :)
 its an amazing world we live in isnt it
 well i &apos;m sure bill would have posted that article himself ,  but no text is allowed in the textbox
 i totally missed that !
 bill gates is the op !
 take a look at gapminder .
 you can find a lot of statistics there quite well visualized .
 i would like to make a plug for r/itsnotallbad as well: i made it several years ago while depressed in grad school ,  and am just getting it running again .
 it &apos;s happy news ,  both in the news and personal stories from reddit users .
 there is a small blurb in  &apos;the week &apos; called it &apos;s not all bad ,  which inspired this subreddit; and every new issue of the week i try to go find the primary stories related to the weeks little blurbs so everyone can read them .
 pretty sure the creator of /r/upliftingnews is a troll .
 every headline is a slightly positive event happening after something truly terrible
 photo or no toto
 answer the question please
 also his word wide internet satellite program .
  elon musk is single handedily giving me faith about the future and that there are good powerful rich people out there working hard to make the future a better place .
  god bless that man .
 gates and buffet are also great for their humanity investments .
 turns out the richest people on the world are also richest in karma too
 never really thought about it like that .
 personally ,  i suffer anxiety ,  depression ,  ptsd and intrusive thoughts .
 all of this makes me tense and prevents me from enjoying my life and existence ,  and prescriptions weren &apos;t helping .
 since i turned 21 (and live in a legal state) ,  i started to use marijuana .
 i can not even explain to you all of the ways this plant has saved me .
 my night terrors have transitioned into mild nightmares ,  i can eat and sleep ,  i laugh with my husband and dogs ,  i can get myself to go for a walk .
 even throw out my prescriptions (please do not do this without consulting your medical doctor) !
 all i want is for marijuana to become federally legal .
 i am certain it could make a positive change in our country in more ways than we know .
 my mother had multiple sclerosis and she had it since she was 18 until she passed away in her 60s .
 the only medicine that she said actually helped her with pain without some ridiculous side effect ,  such as suicidal thoughts or the obliteration of her appetite ,  was marijuana .
 i &apos;ve seen it help people with mental illness too .
 they &apos;re happy ,  they &apos;re motivated ,  they &apos;re not trapped .
 marijuana legalization will help so many people .
 the tax income is merely a bonus .
 people come to the middle as they age .
 generally speaking though ,  i think generations get more and more liberal .
 i honestly believe it’s less polarized and more an extremely vocal minority that can’t be reasoned with .
 hiv by the way can actually cure you of cancer .
 may i ask how cheap ?
 you mean seaweed .
 seawater would kill grass .
 this is in the intro of a vid from pornhub
 seriously this is amazing !
 more like a depressertation  .
 chestnut blight ,  a fungal disease that afflicts asian chestnut trees ,  but does not decimate them .
 the disease was introduced by europeans .
 paraphrased from the wikipedia page ,  to give an idea of the scope: .
 it was estimated 1 of every 4 trees in the appalachians used to be american chestnut .
 by 1904 when it was discovered in the bronx zoo ,  3-4 billion trees were dead .
 nowadays ,  the largest crop of trees is only about 2500 in wisconsin ,  with a few small individual trees around elsewhere .
 they’re currently trying to selectively breed for a blight-resistant tree to be reintroduced ,  which will be composed of all american chestnut genes (vs .
 crossbreeding in the resistance from asiatic chestnuts)
 they are sold out .
  mark your calendars for february next year .
 i would love to build something with american chestnut wood !
 in the analogy the garden is our lives ,  isis are the garden variety weeds .
 if we give up the garden to the weeds then they &apos;ve won .
 can &apos;t believe i &apos;ve seen someone use interrobangs with my own two eyes - this is the real sign of progress .
 my goodness i can &apos;t wait to say that out loud
 there are still plenty of islamists in the same vein still running around in syria ,  although perhaps not as bad as isis .
 plus there are plenty other terrible islamist terror groups in places like libya ,  somalia ,  yemen ,  nigeria ,  with a few of them even being offshoots of isis .
 yeah ,  the kurds fucked them up over the summer .
 the search for truth is slow and methodical .
 this would make an insanely good slogan .
 thanks for this .
 the most exciting phrase to hear in science ,  the one that heralds new discoveries ,  is not “eureka !

 lit-terally that human ?
 always appreciate pnr references .
 that he doesn &apos;t keep kosher ?
 that we are one step closer to fully edible people .
 no ,  i don &apos;t know what that means .
 i guess ,  longer life .
 eh ,  i dunno ,  living for 10 , 000 years might start getting a little old after a while .
 but yes ,  it &apos;d be amazing if we could pull it off .
 ditto ,  i live in alabama ,  and i was even more excited watching this than i was watching doug jones win .
 both of these events give me hope .
 i started crying .
 let me tell you ,  i rarely cry over anything that isn’t a loss of a family member/large events involving something very sad .
 i was crying happily and literally cheering and jumping up and down .
 i’m so excited for a new space race .
 zydrate comes in a little glass vial .
 ohhh wow ,  my first gold ever !
 o_o thank you kind stranger !
 i &apos;m pretty young and i &apos;m at the point where i seriously need to evaluate my relationship with alcohol because i know my liver can &apos;t keep up forever .
  you get old fast; one day it &apos;s keggers in college then in be blink of an eye you realize you &apos;ve been a happy hour every day of the week and we &apos;ll drink all weekend in excess .
 the moment i feel best about as a boss was the day i had a good employee with lots of promise stop his meds and fall off a cliff and showed up hours late ,  still drunk and fell to the floor sobbing .
  his supervisor did great and just kept him calm but he was all but restraining him from leaving .
  i get there and we just sat on the floor of that office for a couple hours .
  he told me he was fucked because he he fucked up ,  like he always did and now he burned his last good chance .
  i talked to him about his life and past for a bit and then told him about my therapy session from the day before .
  i told him that morning had officially never happened and that he could come back tomorrow or later if he needed time and get back to his job .
  we talked about suicide and having already decided not to .
 we talked about trying not to spiral down into a pit just because you fucked up .
 he left a little before lunch .
 i told his crew of techs who saw him that he had a bad day and that we should all remember our own bad days .
 they supported him beautifully and he’s been kicking ass ever since and prospering for it .
 i’ve fallen into a pit of my own now .
  that job is a big part of what got me here .
  that was one of the worthwhile times .
  i feel good about that .
 thanks for reminding me and sorry for the therapeutic word vomit .
 damn ,  that &apos;s such a hopeful thing to hear !
 your bosses sound amazing .
 i wish you luck with your anxiety :)
 do the extended editions !
 nearly twelve hours of pure greatness .
 you say that like it &apos;s a bad thing .
 my son &apos;s are 4 and 1 .
 i cannot wait for the weekend ,  years from now ,  when their mother goes away for a long weekend .
 some old friend &apos;s second marriage .
 or a nephew &apos;s hs graduation .
  something she feels compelled to attend ,  but we &apos;re justified in not having all of us go .
 i &apos;m absolutely looking forward to trilogy weekend .
 and the best part is that the boys will have no idea what i have in store .
 shit i should have quoted gandalf .
 fred mcfeely rogers .
  the best man to ever man .

 sam is the true hero .
 he’s the only one who carried the ring and came out unscathed .
 he was able to go back to real life again .
 he was simple and loyal and unswerving .
 it’s a bit like hermione in the harry potter stories .
 not the main character ,  but the best character .
 but yours has wifi .
 all of my teachers would always yell at me and get upset if they saw wikipedia open in the computer lab .
  &apos;anyone can edit that ,  i don &apos;t even want you on there &apos; .
 but ,  they leave references for me to go to and do my own research &apos; was never a viable answer either ,  and always upset me to see such ignorance in educators .
 my teacher in hs started letting us use wikipedia (as a secondary source) after figuring out the margin of error of our ap history textbooks was greater than wikipedia .
 i knew this girl who ,  for 9 years ,  commuted from the far side of la to irvine .
 this trip ,  for those unfamiliar ,  will consistently take 2-3 hours each way .
 although not feasible for all ,  my advice to you is to move closer to work .
 my commute is 7 minutes each way and i have so much more time for activities .
 it &apos;s very easy to hold hatred ,  blame or disdain for a person you &apos;ve never met and have only ever heard bad things about .
 it &apos;s very difficult to feel those things for someone right in front of you who hasn &apos;t given you a reason to do so .
 it &apos;s human nature to feel compassion for those around us; we are co-dependent ,  tribal creatures .
 similarly ,  it is human nature to feel fear or aggression towards those on the outside ,  who we know of ,  maybe have seen ,  but have never met; other tribes are a threat .
 compassion and contempt are innate parts of our being .
 the best way for compassion to win is to meet as many people as we can ,  traverse language barriers and cultural barriers ,  and treat each other like neighbors .
 as globalisation occurs to an ever-greater extent ,  we are all neighbors ,  and if you shit on your neighbor &apos;s lawn you might as well be shitting on your own .
 you little trees are happy and i love you ,  but you &apos;re terrible .
 you &apos;re all terrible .
 people get cancer because they now live long enough to get it .
 this blew my mind ,  but it all makes so much more sense to me now .
 not to mention ,  the vaccine doesn &apos;t just save the lives of 40k people ,  it prevents them from even contracting that disease in the first place (or at least ,  becoming symptomatic to the point of lost productivity) .
  so really we could only estimate how many people it saves by looking at how many people were killed by it per year extrapolating from that how many people would be killed this year based on things like population growth ,  density changes in major population centers ,  transmission rates given transportation changes ,  how insanely fucking fast those overprotective fucks in charge of madagascar close their ports ,  etc .
 so it &apos;s not saving lives like a fireman carrying people out of a fire ,  it &apos;s saving lives like a fireman going to schools and teaching kids about how to be safe around fire and how to avoid accidentally causing fires .
  how do you even measure that impact ?
  you know it &apos;s there but the exact amount of good is tough to gauge .
 don &apos;t cry too much ,  the federal government is still trying to peddle  &apos;clean coal &apos; .
 i &apos;ve been smoking for 14 years .
 how did you quit ?
 the last time i went cold turkey i had some crazy bad withdrawal symptoms - loss of appetite ,  it triggered my anxiety ,  i just felt awful .
 couldn &apos;t do it .
 that &apos;s good to hear .
 wishing her all the best :) .
 early diagnosis is one of the best scenarios when it comes to cancer in most cases .
 he &apos;s a billionaire !
 500k in karma is like $10 to him !
 someone gilded him too .
 lol as if there is anyone in the world more capable of affording a gilding .
 it &apos;s like poetry ,  it rhymes .
 that &apos;s so frickin adorable oh my god .
 can u imagine going through the notifications though ?
 came here to say medical marijuana .
 glad you &apos;re getting the help that you need .
 i live in sc and i think if everyone had some weed it would help a ton of people out .
 hell ,  we have so much farmland that we could probably supply the nation with weed were it legal here .
 it would go a long way to revitalizing the economy in some of the more rural parts of sc .
 i was reading about this !
 apparently it &apos;s possible to genetically modify hiv so it attacks the unstable cancer cells the same way it would normally attack the immune system
 that doesn &apos;t make it any more interesting ,  jim .
  &apos;that &apos;s so beauty-ful .
 hey ,  hasn &apos;t it been ten seconds since we looked at our lemon tree ?
 does this mean that in the future we might get our elm trees and ash trees back ?
 dutch elm basically took out every elm tree in my city .
 long before i was born but i hear lots of stories of their majesty .
 my dad has flooring in his house that is recycled chestnut made from old church beams .
 apparently they were popular in the high ceilings because spiders don &apos;t like it so they didn &apos;t have to clean up cobwebs .
 i wood love to do that too .
 i &apos;d also love to have even more chestnuts .
 this analogy was much more accurate than i first expected when i started reading it .
 i &apos;m really impressed .
 the real sign of real progress will be when we see someone use interrobangs in the wild without a bunch of comments about how they used interrobangs .
 now i want someone to re-word the song imagine to be about interrobangs .
 you don &apos;t have to wait .
  you can say it now !
 on a more optimistic note ,  i was reading recently that many of the school girls kidnapped by boko haram were rescued .
 i don &apos;t know how recent that really was (it was in the newspaper a few weeks ago) but it is good news .
 i also don &apos;t know how many members of boko haram were killed rescuing those girls but considering they still exist ,  the answer is certainly  &apos;not enough &apos;
 caught between pissed kurds and the iraqi golden division .
 almost feel bad for them .
 don &apos;t forget that for a while after the harnessing of electricity ,  no-one could think of anything better to do with it than party tricks and such .
 true ,  for now at least .
 if it &apos;s possible to harness the higgs field and gravitational waves in some way ,  that would be crazy (fingers crossed for mass effect irl .
 also ,  how in the hell did i forget the rockstar of recent biology that is crispr ?
 you &apos;re definitely right about that one !
 although i do have some reservations about it ,  the possible benefits are seriously immense .
 literally two of my favorite people on earth .
 you poetic noble land mermaid
 people are already edible ,  you &apos;re just not man enough to try :) .
 changed your to you &apos;re for the people who are fun at parties
 well no he didn’t live
 you could pull a total starlord and explore space eventually !
 i started crying .
 from launch to max q i had tears running down my face ,  with a few more at final separation .
 i cry even less .
 i have been to funerals for four relatively close family members in the last two years and never had anything affect me that much .
 and the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery .
 a little glass vial ?
 we welcome anyone ,  even lurkers over in r/stopdrinking !
 you were the person he needed that day .
 you got him out of his pit .
 if you need help getting out of your own pit i &apos;ll help you any way i can .
 fuck me mate ,  you &apos;re a fucking hero for doing that for that guy .
 one of the best bosses i ever had told me that everyone &apos;s entitled to a bad day now and then .
 you can &apos;t have them every day ,  because we &apos;ve got work to do ,  but now and then is ok .
 good for you for recognizing and understanding your employee &apos;s very bad day didn &apos;t define him .
 good shit man ,  you’re a wonderful boss and person just through that anecdote .
 i’m sure you have your faults too but kudos on that and on sharing .
 if you feel bad now find more moments like the above where you help others ,  volunteer or simply lend a caring ear to people in your day to day life ,  it goes a long way and at the end of the day even with all your problems you can feel a little better that you at least helped someone with theirs .
 i watched all 12 hours of it on my way to exchange in new zealand .
 when i got there i found out that this girl (which is now my girlfriend) hadn &apos;t seen it yet ,  so i watched all 12 hours of it one more time with her .
 within 2 weeks i spent 24 hours watching lotr and it was awesome 
 yeah whenever i feel down ,  i remember that i literally live better than many kings of the past .
 they might have had massive political and financial power ,  but they didn &apos;t have  hot water and plumbing ,  air conditioning ,  fridges and microwaves ,  they didn &apos;t have netflix or video games or vr !
 my life is good and i plan to be lazy as shit and enjoy the fruits of humanity &apos;s collective effort .
 i wish i could up vote that sentiment twice .
 sam goes back to real life for a while but does eventually leave to join the other ring bearers in the west .
  the ring still fucked with him .
 fuck you now i need to rewatch both lotr and harry potter thats -24hours
 prk for the win !
 best decision i &apos;ve ever made and that was 12 years ago .
 it &apos;s funny ,  my teachers tell us the opposite and encourage using the sources listed in it .
 but we &apos;re definitely not allowed to source wikipedia itself .
 who the hell would do that to themselves ?
 i might be taking a job in oc and if i do i &apos;m moving to oc .
 while i really like the part of town i live in ,  there &apos;s no way i &apos;m commuting 100 miles round-trip every weekday ,  even if there was never any traffic .
 i think there &apos;s a good reason for that ,  /u/pm_me_yo_butthole
 soo how many pictures have you got so far ?
 congrats on graduating hs and college u/blue_jay_jay !
 keep up the awesome work 
 similarly ,  when helmets were made standard issue in ww1 ,  there was a drastic rise in head injuries .
 because the only other alternative to getting injured when a piece of shrapnel or bullet hits you in the head is a lot less desirable .
 preventive measures save many more lives than reactive measures .
 the federal government is still trying to peddle  &apos;clean coal &apos; .
 please tell me this is a joke .
 i &apos;m two months with no tobacco after a 20 year habit .
 i &apos;ve been vaping as needed ,  usually 3-4 times a day .
 it allows me to slowly reduce the nicotine level of the oils and it satisfies my desire to smoke without totally destroying my lungs .
 i &apos;ve been out drinking (the ultimate test for me) and had zero desire to smoke tobacco .
 we think that because billionaires like bill gates are celebrities ,  they never take time out of their day to do something cool for the general public ,  but realistically he has so much money he can do whatever he desires .
 til bill gates will always stop to pick up even a single karma on the ground
 maybe jeff bezos did it
 they just upload into his brain
 spiders don &apos;t like it .
 hang on while i build an entire house out of chestnut .
 i &apos;ll see you at the eolian .
 oh you are a card .
 i have a few friends in the ligo collaboration that i &apos;ve partied with ,  now i want them to do gravitational wave party tricks !
 if it &apos;s possible to harness the higgs field and gravitational waves in some way ,  that would be crazy (fingers crossed for mass effect irl .
 aren &apos;t gravitational waves extremely weak ?
 like distorting the length of 4 km of space by about the width of a proton ?
 fingers crossed for the discovery of a huge machine that makes space travel easy and propells technological advancement ,  but then the huge ass space robots who made the machine come to  &apos;harvest &apos; us all and turn us into a pulp for new robot blood ?
 you are a beautiful ,  talented ,  brilliant ,  powerful muskox
 and the zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy 
 a little glass vial !
 thank you very much for the offer .
 it helped to write it out .
 it helps more to be heard .
  i’m down but ,  mercifully ,  surrounded by support .
  pass mine on to the next please .
 your comment is the true answer to ops r/askreddit  .
  thanks for making me optimistic about the future .
 that’s a great way of putting it .
  it didn’t define him ,  but he didn’t see it that way .
  he’d put months of work into being someone he’d wanted to be and succeed time and again ,  but the one bad day was all that mattered .
  i’m going to have to hold that mirror up to myself later .
  thanks for the insight .
 this entire situation you &apos;ve described is my dream .
 i once saw some photos of a 19th century aristocrat in paris who died in his home and no one found him for a long time and no one cleaned out the house .
 they had a tour of his home and i just kept thinking how much better i have it .
 at least we can &apos;t know how those mother fuckers in the future are living .
 i &apos;ll do it for you .
 i don’t remember this .
 it’s been too long since i read it .
 i just remember him having heaps of children with rosie .
 tell me that frodo was waiting for him there ,  please .
 that would be perfect .
 thanks for the correction .
 i always loved how the ring tempted him .
 when it gave him visions of his most wild dreams and ambitions ,  it was to be the best goddamn gardener in the world ,  where people from all lands would come to see how green his hedges were ,  or how large and delicious the tomatoes that he grew .
 this made the gift of the mallorn ( ?
 ) tree even better in the end .
 and you probably shouldn &apos;t be allowed to .
  wikipedia articles can have vandalized information for a while before they &apos;re corrected .
  you may run across such a page in your research .
 that said ,  it &apos;s one of the most reliable information sites anywhere ,  and teachers should be teaching how to use it as a provisional source .
 the journalistic rule of having at least two independent sources is a good one ,  not just for journalism but for life .
 similarly ,  in ww1 (or 2 ,  i cant remember) they were trying to armour planes against bullets .
 when deciding where to put more armour ,  they looked at where the planes coming back were getting hit ,  and were gonna build there .
 then ,  some smart ass said wait !
 put the armour everywhere else !
 and he was right .
 because the planes that made it back could obviously survive the hits .
 the ones that didn &apos;t make it back ,  would &apos;ve been hit elsewhere .
 head injury vs headshot fatality ?
 now if we could just get some people in congress to listen to this !
 if it &apos;s stupid ,  harms the general population and can be profitable ,  you can bet your damn ass that the american government will defend it beyond what &apos;s reasonable .
 fortunately ,   &apos;whatever he desires &apos; is usually some initiative or project that &apos;s very beneficial to society 
 shoutout to /r/longboyes  !
 that &apos;s a hell of a slogan .
 good god that would be amazing .
 you cunning ,  pliable ,  chestnut haired sunfish .
 you beautiful rule-breaking moth !
 and when the gun goes off ,  it sparks ,  and you &apos;re ready for surgery .
 whoa ,  i did the website for tdc with darren/terrance - i loved repo (watched it after working with them) .
 never thought i’d see a reference in the wild .
 and the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery .
 yep ,  they went and hung out forever as best bros .
 yup all people who were ring bearers were permitted to cross the sea .
 back to your original argument though i would say the only reason sam didn &apos;t get jacked up was that he was only a ring holder for a short time ,  the majority of that journey was frodo carrying it and i imagine that is why it took so much more of a toll on him .
 who knows how messed up sam might have become .
 i went from not being able to see the giant e on the chart to reading a clock on the drs wall in minutes .
 you definitely shouldn &apos;t as that &apos;s not what wikipedia is for .
 it is to provide summaries of material from other sources .
 it itself is not a source ,  so should never be cited as one .
 reluctant high five
 abraham wald i believe it was ,  at least apocryphally .
 i mean it is a joke ,  but it &apos;s also not a joke
 do you have a jot to cover my entrance ?
 get out of my head
 i &apos;m not even sure what it would be ,  but it would be a wild ride .
   &apos;did you see that ball oscillate on a zeptometer scale ?
 you beautiful ,  naive ,  sophisticated newborn baby
 magic ring 1 : marriage ring 0
 sorry to burst your bubble but they did not live forever .
 the undying lands don &apos;t make you immortal ,  it &apos;s just the land for immortals .
 in fact ,  sam and frodo &apos;s lives were shorter because of them going west .
  &apos;and were you so to voyage that escaping all deceits and snares you came indeed to aman ,  the blessed realm ,  little would it profit you .
 for it is not the land of manwe that makes its people deathless ,  but the deathless that dwell therein have hallowed the land; and there you would but wither and grow weary the sooner ,  as moths in a light too strong and steadfast .
 this is better .
 he is also one of the few ring bearers to willingly give up the ring while it was in his possession .
  i think maybe bilbo is the only other one ?
 ( tom bombadil doesn &apos;t count :p .
 please wash hands first
 i figure the numbers didn’t match up to common sense .
 no armor around the cockpit and fuel tanks ,  but heavy armor for the wingtips and landing assembly ?
 this story is commonly told as an example of bayesian reasoning ,  and is a great way to get across how easy it is to make logic mistakes in interpreting statistical information .
 and it &apos;s a kinda fascinating story ,  because thomas bayes original work was mostly ignored until laplace adopted and popularized it .
 even then it was considered almost a heretical view on statistics by many people .
 but boy did it become useful by the time of ww2 .
 the  &apos;game &apos; alan turing and other codebreakers at blechley park  &apos;played &apos; before they built their computer ,  was in essence a bayesian inference problem computed with paper cards and hole punches .
 so it &apos;s not just a story of some clever smart ass somewhere: it &apos;s connected to some surprisingly deep ideas and the computing revolution itself .
 though in this story ,  the smart ass was abraham wald ,  who was most definitely a seriously smart person .
 a round of vintish wine is on me
 i should just start doing that .
 sometimes i wonder why i even bother .
 sometimes i wonder why i need you at all !
 favorite comment thread ever !
 and amber sweet is addicted to the knife .
 i love repo so much and rarely find people who enjoy it as well ,  or have even heard of it .
 so it &apos;s always nice to find .
 look at this fella .
 he &apos;s of the hairless variety !
 rare and silky smooth to the touch ,  he actually likes when you rub his head !
 look at his leg going !
 get a load &apos;a this sheila !
 i can imagine this one spending all of her free time sleeping in her lil &apos; hidey hole ,  only coming out five times a week to spend hours at a place where she probably regrets being at in the first place ,  n &apos; she &apos;ll do this most weeks of her life allllll the way up until she dies .
 this ones pretty big for a female too ,  bigger than most average males actually ,  don &apos;t think that gives her any luck during the mating season .
  laughs in australian 
 i don &apos;t care ,  he calls me a beaut and i really needed to hear it
  &apos;oi ,  now lookie here !
 notice how he seems almost entirely apathetic to my attack .
 that &apos;s because he spends almost every waking moment pretending not to be bothered by the current situation he is in ,  despite the fact that he is incredibly irritated .
 to him ,  this is just another monday morning staff meeting !
 he is truly a gorgeous example of mental endurance !
  &apos;isn &apos;t he a beauty ?
 you &apos;re alright ,  fella .
 this guy is out looking for a sheila but he isn &apos;t having much luck .
 he &apos;s coming in late to the party .
 “this little fella looks upset ,  but he actually craves physical contact !
 lot of you weirdos are into thumbs in buttholes .
 “oi ,  be very careful mates .
 we have to show dominance .
 if we show any affection towards this creature he’ll get attached to us and never leave us alone .
 truly one of the most terrifying beasts in north america”
  &apos;this little bugga simulates reproduction up to 5 times a day !
 almost exclusively without a mate .
 then i imagine he would shove a dorito in my mouth ,  and chuck me back into my bedroom .
 this lil ranga is quite the sneaky little one !
 this particular type of animal can hide in a dark room all day and never even see the sunshine .
 she will do as much as she can to avoid others of her kind .
 i don’t remember what he called gingers so i fixed it ,  thank you for correcting me fellow redditors
 oi ,  this ere is a common member of ‘is species ,  and as you can see e’s got a fairly advanced case of fur loss ,  especially concentrated ‘ere at the top of his ‘ead .
  many males you find in the wild with this condition will try to compensate by growing the fur around their faces ,  and this fella is no different !
  this one looks like he spends ‘is days being poked and nipped at by ‘is wee ones !
  note the characteristic paunchy belly and the general lack of muscle tone !
  this fella can spend up to 12 hours a day grazing ,  and trying to find a nice spot to curl up for some shuteye .
 apparently i’ve accidentally reimagined steve irwin as a 19th century cockney bootblack ,  but i’m leaving it
  &apos;ohhhh ,  he &apos;s angry !
 calm down big fella .
 ain &apos;t gon hurtcha .
 yeah ,  there we go .
 see he likes when i give his noggin scritches like this .
 yeah ,  these guys like to get all big an blustry ,  especially in front of a keyboard .
 they &apos;ll be real mean to each other ,  but they &apos;re good folk though .
 just gotta let them know ya care bout &apos;em .
 everyone acting like steve ever said something bad about the animals .
 that &apos;s not a thing .
  &apos;now i now what yer thinkin &apos; ,  this here fella looks like an absolute killa .
 he &apos;s big ,  he &apos;s covered in hair ,  and if he wanted to ,  he could probably knock mah block off with one swing .
 the truth is ,  his kind look far more scary than they really are .
 despite their size ,  they &apos;re actually quite timid ,  and will only attack when threatened and backed into a corner .
 truth is ,  he just wants to find a sheilah he can settle down with and ,  who knows ,  maybe have a coupla kids .
 sadly ,  this fella hasn &apos;t had much luck lately .
 he &apos;s the last of his line ,  and it would be cryin &apos; shame if he never got a family of his own .
 \puts ps2 controller in my hands\ .
  &apos;luckily ,  here at australia zoo ,  we have a state-of-the-art gaming room ,  where this fella can play the video games of his youth ,  and relive his days as a juvenile ,  when life seemed so full of possibilities .
 typed this just before i went to bed thinking i was far too late to the party to get noticed .
 thanks for all the upvotes and awards !
 i hope this made you laugh and i &apos;m sorry if it makes you sad .
 if it did ,  please be kind to yourself ,  life has a way of untangling itself .
 steve would want you to care for yourself just as much as he &apos;d want you to care for nature .
  &apos;this one right here ,  can put up a fight if you put a bowl cheetos within the area .
 good thing is that this bloke is actually calm because he ate a full bowl of cheetos .
 this unusually large example of his species is known to consume enormous quantities of cheese in one sitting .
  he is a very stealthy creature ,  with the ability to sit in one spot at a computer for up to 8 hours at a time .
  this number has been drastically reduced size the introduction of a mate and offspring into the nest .
  this animal lives in a dilapidated bachelor pad and is capable of eating his weight in pudding over a weekend !
  &apos;   thanks for the gold and the little angel thingee !
 this is the biggest chinese i’ve ever seen !
 at a whopping 6’3” and 210 pounds ,  this bugga has a nasty habit of eating all his brother’s food .
 camera pans to my anemic brother
 this creature’a diet consists of almost all caffeinated beverages !
 and would you give a whiff of the stench coming from his bathroom !
 it seems this little creature eats so little fiber that its shits come out as an earthy ,  putrid gaseous substance !
  &apos;this big guy is quite greasy due to his natural habitat of an engine bay .
 i believe he is extreamly angry due to the loss of all his 10mm sockets !
  &apos;he &apos;s getting quite angry when he &apos;s getting poked with a stick !
 \pokes me with a stick\ .
 this fine specimen was a hard one to catch !
 now ,  let &apos;s look at her .
 as you can see ,  changes make her stressed and anxious ,  thus more aggressive .
 if provoked ,  she &apos;ll attack on sight .
 she has the appetite of a great white .
 she &apos;s an omnivore ,  but eats meat more willingly .
 one off thing about her diet is that she loves broccolis .
 she eats anything that &apos;s prepared with them .
 see this is why you take physical exercise seriously kids .
 if you act like him and sit in front of a computer all day it’s really easy to pull a sneaky one in ya .
  &apos;this lad drinks too much .
  &apos;we have an indigenous person to the americas out of his reconstructed habitat .
 they were contained to a small portion of land only for this bugger to free himself from such limited space and find himself tangled in debt &apos;
 im sitting in my chair looking at reddit on my laptop .
 ive had a few beers ,  smoked a bowl and am relaxing .
 steve jumps out from behind the chair ,  tackles me and gets me in a headlock .
 steve:  &apos;easy ,  fella .
 easy ,  there mate &apos; .
 me:  &apos;what the fuck dude &apos; .
 steve (looking at camera that isn &apos;t there and struggling):  &apos;awww ,  look at  &apos;im ,  hes nervous ,  but that &apos;s all roight &apos;  &apos;youre all right ,  fella &apos; .
 steve:  &apos;this here is a common specimen ,  you can tell by his surroundings that he &apos;s given up on life and is just passing time until his eventual death &apos; .
 me: no longer struggling ,  because who cares .
 steve:  &apos;notice how he has given up struggling .
 listen to that .
  &apos; (steve puts his ear to my mouth dramatically)  &apos;that is the wheezing of a man who hasn &apos;t done any activity in ages .
 notice his surroundings .
 empty beer cans ,  crumbs on the chair ,  a bottle of lotion and crumpled up tissues .
 i think i have found his nest &apos; .
 my wife walks out of the bedroom to see steve on top of me in the living room .
 steve:  &apos;aww look at that !
 there &apos;s his mate .
 this is a middle aged housewife who looks to be giving up a bit  &apos;erself &apos; notice the frown lines and her faded nightgown &apos; .
 wife:  &apos;fuck you ,  asshole !
 steve:  &apos;aww youre alright !
 steve turns his attention back to the camera that isn &apos;t there .
 steve:  &apos;now each of these specimens is a little different ,  but judging by the items in his nest and his mate ,  we can tell that he hasn &apos;t had his yearly loveless sex in quite a while ,  and is probably suffering from mild undiagnosed depression &apos; .
 wife:  &apos;i &apos;m calling the cops .
 steve:  &apos;ah crikey !
 i seem to have upset his mate ,  so i should probably release him into the wild before i get into too much trouble out here in the bush &apos; .
 yeah ,  its some australian guy in cargo shorts and he &apos;s beating up my husband .
 steve:  &apos;you &apos;re alright .
 you &apos;re alright ,  aint ya &apos; .
 wife:  &apos;yeah ,  he &apos;s talking to a wall like there &apos;s someone there .
 no i don &apos;t know .
 yes ,  thank you ,  please hurry .
 steve picks me up and guides me back to my chair .
 steve:  &apos;i know i have seen these specimens many times in my career ,  but they always amaze me .
 look how he sits there beautifully while he searches the internet for increasingly disturbing porn .
 can &apos;t blame him ,  he &apos;s just trying to feel something .
 i &apos;m always in awe how resilient these specimens are .
 my wife sobs in the corner holding her phone as i just stare at steve irwin .
 steve leaves the house ,  backing away slowly .
 wife and i are just left wondering what the fuck happened
 this creature is an easy one to spot ,  always in the same spot on the sofa ,  most commonly seen with either reddit or animal crossing .
  &apos;because of the general mess of the surroundings you might be surprised to know that this little fella here ,  actually build or repaired almost all this surprisingly nice furniture in this place .
 this species is tasteful ,  yet disorganized .
 she &apos;s a little shy but we got her !
 feed her some sugary breads and she &apos;ll calm right down even with a temper !
 now her primary predator is a spider ,  once they see her they go right for her ,  in response she will aggressively scream at it until another of her species comes by to kill it .
 this one has been known to scream for at least 5 minutes straight even in the middle of the night .
 as you may have noticed ,  i caught this one on her own ,  that &apos;s because she screams at spiders while her neighvors and roommates are asleep .
 i don &apos;t have an answer to this ,  but congrats .
 this is probably the best question ever asked on reddit .
 this bloke is in a completely relaxed state .
 not a care in the world .
 the female is home and he forgot to pick up the groceries !
 e’s in for it now !
 i &apos;m really upset that most of these comments boil down to  &apos;i &apos;m a fat ,  lazy incel that just sits at my computer all day .
  &apos; steve would love each and every one of you and he &apos;d have lots of interesting stuff to say about you .
 even if you are a fat ,  lazy incel .
  &apos;now lookie what we  &apos;ave here !
 this gorgeous specimen is genuinely happy !
 a real gem to find in it &apos;s kinds age range .
 woah boy woah ,  this ones got some confidence alright ,  and look at its gut !
 a true king here .
 i tell ya ,  a real chippy one this one !
 i am happy and i know thats not cool here ,  plz don &apos;t downvote too much thank you (;
 “this animal’s nipples are the size of small dicks ,  blimey !
 this lazy bastard hasnt done laundry in weeks ,  or checked his email !
 av a look at this beaut !
 this magnificent specimen spends whuay too much toime wawtching the awfice !
 me: what the fu- .
 steve: oi ,  check this fella out !
  &apos;e &apos;s struggling and struggling ,   &apos;e &apos;s a nervous feller all right !
 but  &apos;e doesn &apos;t have too much muscle ,  or fat for that matter ,  so a skinny bloke like  &apos;im doesn &apos;t take too long to subdue .
 me: oh god please don &apos;t hurt me .
 steve: it &apos;s alright ,  it &apos;s alright ,  i ain &apos;t gonna hurt ya .
 this young feller never grew up with much interaction other than  &apos;is immediate family ,  so that &apos;s why  &apos;e &apos;s so scared and nervous .
 but don &apos;t feel bad for  &apos;im ,  since leaving his natural habitat  &apos;e &apos;s matured and  &apos;is finding his new habitat ,  and sooner or later he &apos;s gonna find a nice sheilah !
 me: oh fuck oh fu- wait ,  what ?
 steve: see ,  once you give  &apos;im some assurance he calms down ,  he shows his true nature !
 a calm ,  confident fellow who only wants to prove himself to his neighbors .
 but little does he know ,   &apos;e &apos;s got a fine future ahead of  &apos;im ,  and he &apos;s done more than enough to prove himself .
 i appreciate it .
 steve: not a problem ,  you &apos;re alright mate !
  &apos;crikey , we got a big one !
  &apos;  &apos;we &apos;ve just caught a 220lb degenerate weeb from its habitat known as the bedroom .
 this fella eats instant noodles and rice only and sleeps with its figurines , rem and astolfo body pillows .
 when it do sleep that is &apos;  &apos;this kind of weeb with especially whats going on in the world , can watch 3 seasons in a day and still have time to play games instead of finishing its homework &apos;  &apos;welp imma let this beauty go back to its natural habitat now &apos; .
 this animal sleeps 12 hours a day and looks at different sizes of screens in the time he is awake .
 now the trick to not being overpowered by this wild beast is to hold your breath .
 it emits a noxious fume that will render you unconscious if smelt or induce vomiting if tasted
  &apos;aahh ,  the north american neck beard .
 he must have run outta chicken tendas and left his nest in search of more .
 they &apos;re fierce shitposters but lack necessary survival skills for the wild .
 usually a karen ,  their mother ,  will do the scavenging for them due to their lack of competence .
 this one &apos;s a beaut .
 now don &apos;t pay the thrashing any mind ,  this sheila gets very confused when having to interact with any human but if she broke free there wouldn &apos;t be any danger ,  she &apos;d just stare awkwardly for a few minutes before scurrying off .
 now what &apos;s really weird about this animal is the spikes ,  clearly they were meant at some point for self defence but easing of selection pressures for this species has meant these spikes are almost completely pliant .
 sometimes this poor sheila &apos;s spikes can bend completely and stab her when she &apos;s trying to defend herself .
  &apos;look at this handsome devil !
 it &apos;s a little known fact that this fella is capable of operatin &apos; on as little as 3 hours of uneasy sleep !
 i &apos;ve also observed him eat an entire mixing bowl of fried rice ,  passing out for the night ,  then waking up and still being hungry !
 crikey ,  i know it &apos;s hard to imagine but this bloke makes it look easy !
 honestly ,  i &apos;m just scrolling through and looking for any comment by u/yourdailydevil at this point
  &apos;why ,  ain &apos;t she a bitter but ,  gave up right quick didn &apos; she ?
 this on here dyes her hair a vibrant red colour ,  because other members of her species compliment her on it every time she leaves her burrow !
 which is important ,  as it encourages her to fight against her depression !
 that &apos;s a good girl ,  off with ya now !
 after he let &apos;s me go i &apos;d probably find a place to take a nap .
 my stamina is quite shitty ,  struggling would have drained me very quickly .
  &apos;now ,  this little creatchah is always looking for solitude and a way to escape human activity ,  so you can tell she &apos;s right pissed at me ,  look at her ears .
 you can usually find her hoidin &apos; out in the woods and rustling around the underbrush .
 howevah ,  we can &apos;t just let her do what she loikes ,  we &apos;re gonna move her to a new spot with loads of her kind ,   &apos;cause i believe socialization is real important &apos;
 look at the sexual dimorphism on this bloke !
 look at  &apos;em big beauuuuutiful wiskers on this adult male .
 we could take a look at his dangly bits to be sure ,  but it &apos;s typically only the males that exhibit this feature .
 another thing i notice right off the bat is this is one of the most pale examples i &apos;ve had the pleasure of dealing with .
 these humans tend to be very adaptive to their environments and come in all kinds of shapes and colors .
 the pale skin tells me this fella is likely nocturnal or at least spends most of his time hiding from the sun in some kind of den or cave or something .
 notice the prehensile thumb and the orange powdery coloring at the tips of his fingers .
 this likely means cheetos are his primary food source .
 humans tend to be omnivores and will eat just about anything .
 you &apos;re a big guy ,  aren &apos;t ya ,  mate .
 alright ,  he &apos;s thrashing around quite a bit ,  i think we &apos;ve stressed him out .
 i &apos;m going to let him go .
 look at him run .
 he &apos;s not very fast but look at the way he raises up on his hind legs to get around .
  &apos;naow this fella is long and lean ,  which would have suited him in his previous habitat ,  but he has had a bit of a spat with his fiesty sheila ,  and naow he lives out here in what we call a  &apos;trailer in the woods .
  &apos; these normally social animals can become very standoffish if they endure trauma like this .
 keep an eye on this sheila !
 if the mood gets her roight ,  she’ll bite yor ‘ead off ,  not with ‘er teeth ,  but with sahcasm .
 now look at this bugguh here ,  surrounded by electronic screens ,  the nerd is most comfortable in their computer hutch .
 from here they can see the world ,  people ,  and goings on without any direct interaction .
  much like the owl ,  the nerd sits and observes .
 unlike the owl ,  the nerd can &apos;t turn their head very far at all .
 she &apos;s a noice girl really but she gets really nervous !
 easy ,  easy ,  no one &apos;s gonna hurtcha .
 she &apos;s a noice girl she &apos;s just scared so she &apos;s tryna fight me ,  but i &apos;ve got her in a strong grip so she can &apos;t get me with those strong hindfeet .
 you wouldn &apos;t wanna be on the end of that kick !
 and now i &apos;m gonna just soothe her !
 easy ,  there ya go .
 see how she just relaxes ,  now she knows that i &apos;m not gonna hurt her .
 now we can get a good look at this girl ,  and the first thing you &apos;ll notice is how colourful the markings around her eyes are !
 she likes to use pigments to paint her eyes these byooootiful colours .
 scientists used to think she did this just to attract a mate but she seems to just do it for fun !
 she &apos;s a byootiful lil artist .
 you see in her paw there .
 its alright girl ,  i &apos;m not gonna take it from yer .
 you see in her other paw she &apos;s holding on to a pencil .
 she uses that to do gorgeous drawings !
 right i &apos;m gonna let her go now .
 now she knows she &apos;s not in danger ,  she &apos;s not gonna bite ,  and she &apos;s not gonna run away .
 and she just carries on with her drawin !
 and she &apos;s gonna let me sit and watcher .
 i don &apos;t care what he tells the audience ,  i just want him to take his finger out my butt
 “oi she just came off a 12 hour sleep but don’t let her fool ya ,  she’ll eat and go right back to it .
 be sure to mind your distance; this wild girl likes to bite if she’s woken .
 you guys are seeing history today folks ,  it’s extremely rare to see one of these leave it’s bedroom ,  let alone make the range of noises it made while i captured it !
 can i just say this is an amazing question
 “here we have a sorry lad .
 recently losing its mate ,  this bugga lays in its den all day long ,  weeping .
 “this lil’ beauty somehow managed to shed off the pounds since i last saw him !
 he’s got an amazing ability to read our emotions ,  as well as easily convey his own in astounding detail !
 one of his favorite meals is tuna ziti .
 what a unique lil fella !
 always a pleasure spending time with him” .
 then he shoves a pringle in my mouth and lets me saunter off to my gf .
 i cant beat myself down .
 oi ,  be very careful with this big boy .
 when every he feels cornered by a predator or a mate ,  he &apos;ll throw all of his emotional baggage as a defense mechanism .
  &apos;these north american breeds have highly complex social structures .
 much like bees or ants ,  but without the good-faith cooperation .
 its high sugar diet can make it unpredictable and dangerous .
 they &apos;re big fellas tho aren &apos;t they ?
 this amazing creature is known as the procrastinator in latin it is waitis longtimis .
 he is known for attending college for ten years and has yet to earn even an associates degree .
 the procrastinator has been known to take down more than a quarter ounce of weed per day sometimes more if he gets really bored or it’s shark week .
 be very careful leaving your food around this one .
 he will kill a burger and fries in the time it takes you to wash your hands .
 there are maybe a handful of these lazy ass creatures left on this planet .
 thank god for that .
 look here at this beautiful creature .
 many people misunderstand this little guy because any contact and he may shutdown completely ,  however if you approach slowly and quietly .
 look at that ,  give em a little scratch on his head and he &apos;s completely wrapped himself around me and fallen asleep .
 -falling asleep in steve &apos;s arms is the most comforting thought i can imagine .
 i envy all the animals that had that with him .
 the wild strawberrycocoa is known to drink 1/5th of his bodyweight in coffee a day
 ahh ,  this fella right here likes wearing his wife’s underwear .
 all right ,  look this here is one of em bachelor canucks .
 rarely ever seen outside of his one bedroom apartment for which he pays too much for and can &apos;t find a job because a pandemic has ravaged his society .
 now what &apos;s interesting is he &apos;s also what we call an insomniac and is afraid of romantic commitment with his kind .
 to cope with all this  &apos;anxiety &apos; ,  this canuck uses lots of cannabis as you can tell by his lethargic state and red eyes .
  &apos;you &apos;ll notice this wee fella isn &apos;t fighting back .
 that &apos;s because all of his fighting methods are rendered useless without a keyboard & mouse .
 the esportis streamajourus is a docile creature &apos;
 look at this one .
 he has 7 extra teeth than a normal one and is trying to grab at me with his toes .
 edit changed from 6 to 7 apparently that one that hadn’t breached yet had ,  never noticed .
 4 wisdom teeth and now 3 teeth in a second row two on my right side and one on the left .
 “this one ‘ere’s a rather tricky bugga !
 if left alone near an object it could use to harm itself , it’s quite prone to doing so .
 if it doesn’t , it will either spend its time recreating procreation without a mate or performing the interesting feat of eating up to three times its weight in food !
 “shhh ,  quiet with this one .
  see the way that one is curled ‘round ‘erself in the corner ?
  we have to be real careful with this one ,  she’s fragile .
 it seems she’s about to eat ‘er own young as a response to stress .
  let’s back quietly away ,  this could get real dangerous ,  mate .
 this one’s tough to get ahold of !
 they’re shy but compassionate individuals !
 they won’t come up to you or actively seek you out but if you go up to one of em’ ,  they’re the friendliest creatures i’ve ever met !
 they love to sleep a lot ,  but don’t wake em’ up because they’ll get a lil’ cranky .
 these guys love to be held so don’t be shy to pick one up if ya ever encounter one !
 “this ones a slimy one !
 he masturbates constantly !
 got a good laugh imagining steve irwin giving scritches to a bald man on the head ,  thanks mate
 aww did he find your spot ?
 but she &apos;ll find a fella who loves every bit of  &apos;er !
 just you watch !
 you &apos;re a beaut mate
 crikey thats a beaut beardbeard if i ever sawhr it
 what a beauuuuty of a beard on this specimen ,  just look at the eveness and how it covers the lower part of the face ,  absolutely beautiful ,  now lets just let it go back into its natural habitat ,  good bye you glorious bearded captain
 this is hilarious and i wish i couldn’t relate to it haha
 that &apos;s the spirit !
 how the fu fu fuck did i get 2 .
 5k upvotes for this lame comment ?
 it was sincere but still .
 i never thought a parody of steve erwin would resonate so much with me .
 ha well this one hit close to home
 holy shit ,  i found a male of my species !
 i laughed way harder at that last bit than i probably should have .
 “looking for a sheila” has me crying ,  cheers !
 steve irwin would give us all the validation we desperately need .
 this actually sounds like him .
 this is exactly how steve spoke ,  love it .
 i was gonna say .
 knowing steve he would say a lot of nice things and i would just start crying .
  &apos;hes a little sad righ &apos; now ,  why don &apos; you pet him ,  give  &apos;im a little rub &apos;
 “as you can see he has a little well known illness called “clinical depression , ” poor fella .
 he would rather avoid all physical contact so not to get hurt when we put him down and abandon him later .
 he’s also a little worried about hurting us when he decides it’s time to kill himself ,  which we hope will be never .
 he’s just too important to the rest of the world and much too beautiful ,  it would be a completely tragedy if we lost him too soon .
 the thumb in buttholes is a reference to a very old and hilarious southpark episode if you weren &apos;t aware .
 i’m gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now
 i don’t like how i feel attacked by this .
 so i’m going to jam my thumb right up his butthole !
 when i was a kid ,   my parents were about to get divorced ,  so i spent my time hiding .
 one day ,  i was so desperate for some human contact that i sat in a busy place on the playground and looked sad ,  hoping someone would ask if i was okay .
 man i miss that guy .
  towards the end of my tenure at the cum bottling plant we used to get huge purchase orders from his rescue habitats all over australia .
 steve ,  in a barely audible whisper as he gets low to the ground: .
 the u/squeeeeenis is an endangered fella ,  meanin &apos; there aren &apos;t many of  &apos;em left ,  and he most likely won &apos;t find a mate .
 nah if you watch  &apos;ere ,  he &apos;s trynna attract a sheilah .
 five minutes of silence as squeeeeenis stares at his screen ,  before typing  &apos;sup &apos; to the onlyfans girl he &apos;s subbed to .
 followed by more dead silence .
 better luck next time ,  little fella .
 if you see one of these in the wild ,  it &apos;s crucial you give them the space they need ,  as many of  &apos;em can be  &apos;ighly poisonous .
 no one believes that “almost .
 we must belong to the same species .
  &apos;you &apos;re ol right sweethaat ,  you &apos;re ol right &apos;
 how man times you pulled your horn today bud ?
 ballpark 6 to 8 ?
 you &apos;re a fuckin animal .
 now what i’m gonna do is jam my thumb right up his butthole ,  if i get bit out here i’m 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital; i betta be real careful jamming my thumb in his butthole .
 ah ,  the fapalotus ,  very common in this area .
 sometimes a man just wants to lay in bed ,  masturbate and eat doritos all day
 man are all gingers the same ?
 stop exposing me ,  i &apos;m trying to hide !
 except he would call you a ranga not a ginger
 i didn &apos;t need personal attacks ,  ok ?
 (tho i &apos;m an artifical redhead it still hurts .
 yet another ginger checking in to agree .
 we don’t seem to take well to sunlight or others of the human variety .
 the ones with four legs and fur ,  though ?
 as a fellow redhead ,  i was looking for something like your post .
 “this ginga porcelain skin burns with even 20 minutes of uv exposure without intervention .
 in the summa-time ,  shoulder freckles multiply 10 fold” or something along those lines lol
 ginger female here whos eating pizza in the dark .
 i feel emotional .
 the first half of this hits too close to home .
  &apos;nipped at by his wee ones &apos;  .
 i attempted to write this ,  but i &apos;m not as eloquent as you !
 maybe add in  &apos;this ones got a coffee dependence ,  see its just after 3pm and he &apos;s chucking back number 13 ,  and bet he &apos;ll throw back a few more and then grumble about a bad nights sleep later .
 this is not an australian accent .
 steve irwin wasn &apos;t a cockney .
 h-dropping is not a thing in australian english
 i love that you went with such a wholesome approach lmao
 i think that’s more just because redditors are self loathing
 everyone acting like steve ever said something bad about the animals .
 that &apos;s not a thing .
  steve irwin was the best and this question from op is golden .
 thanks for not going for the usual low effort self-deprecating angle ,  unlike most of the top comments
 that made me a little sad .
 as a fellow large hairy man this hits home
 that last paragraph is waaaayyyyy too relatable for my comfort .
 x i’m in this post and i don’t like it
 if my time trying to explain being childfree has told me anything ,  last of his line doesn &apos;t sound as good as  &apos;this bloodline dies with me &apos; like you are doing something for the good of the world .
 this seems to be an ongoing trend with alot of these (looking for a sheilah but unable to do so) .
 if me and my husband can find each other in the deepest of the interwebs ,  there &apos;s someone out there .
 it just may be a matter of time .
  &apos;i find it easiest to subdue one of these little fellas by withholding a local treat ,  mt .
 dew ,  till it settles down and plays nice &apos;
 do you just like grab a cheese block and chow down ?
 those are rookie numbers ,  i can do 12 .
 u/bigtimejohnny attempts to thrash about helplessly ,  trying to bite his captor .
 steve: nah ,  as you can see the little buggers tryna bite me ,  but as you can see here .
 pulls bigtimejohnnys lips aside to reveal his gums  .
 his teeth won’t do much to me as he lives off a diet of mostly pudding ,  so he’s a harmless little fella .
 off you go naw .
 he releases him ,  leaving bigtimejohnny to scamper into his burrow of unwashed blankets
 now these humps you see along the chest ,  belly and sides are actually fatty deposits .
 while many animals use these for sustenance through hard times like winter or drought ,  bigtimejohnny seems to have no use for this collected fat except to ward off members of the opposite sex .
  &apos;you can tell where it nests by looking for the empty mountain dew cans and doritos bags .
 buy some frosted mini wheats
 10mm sockets are a lie propagated by snap on marketing department .
 i welded a washer flat against the side of a 10mm 3/8 socket and put it on my key ring thinking i had won .
 lost my key chain the next day
 why the hell is it always 10mm .
 lets see steve irwin find and catch those sneaky bastards .
 i believe he is extreamly angry due to the loss of all his 10mm sockets !
 /r/justrolledintotheshop is leaking .
 now i &apos;m going to shove my thumb up it &apos;s butthole ,  that &apos;ll really piss &apos;em off
 i think it &apos;s important that we agree that you don &apos;t talk to steve irwin this way on reddit .
 steve picks u/sileo009 up from his hind legs as he thrashes about before giving up .
 steve: nah isn &apos;t this a beauty .
 just look at the stretch marks on this big fella .
 nah this  &apos;ere &apos;s what we call a redditor ,  an despite their size they &apos;re not particularly dangerous ,  see .
 steve begins stroking sileo009 &apos;s head ,  mesmerizing him into a calm ,  accepting state .
 while naught common out in the wilds ,  these fellas like to stay in their little burrows where its safe .
 have to say he &apos;s more scared of you then you are of  &apos;im .
 sileo009 just sort of flops ,  limp on the ground ,  staring ahead and licking his lips .
 the redditor can grow to three times the size of a human ,  truly remarkable ,  as it &apos;s always preparin &apos; to hibernate .
 this is why so many people think they &apos;re dangerous ,  is they &apos;ll catch  &apos;em digging through their trash tryna find somethin &apos; to eat ,  but really all this fella wants is a little love .
 steve: as ye can see ,  this poor fella &apos;s diet consists mostly of jack daniels ,  which makes him relatively harmless in the wild .
 poke u/jacksagain with a stick .
 the sad creature tries to fight back with a wave of the arms ,  then gives up .
 this makes the boy relatively  &apos;armless ,  so if ya see him in the wild ,  don &apos;t be scared ,  just wave yer arms about to confuse him like this: .
 the sudden arm waving causes jacksagain to vomit and roll over ,  defeated .
 you and wifey good bro ?
 i started out reading this with a smile thinking  &apos;finally ,  here is someone who is just as much of a failure as i am !
  &apos; but then i got to the part about the wife and was like  &apos;nah ,  this guy still has a little bit of hope ,  way more successful than me &apos; .
 still enjoyed it though; very well written !
 this has to be the best one yet
 fuck dude ,  brutal ,  well written ,  and i am sorry
 dude ,  do you need to talk ?
 well shit ,  if you &apos;re self aware ,  you can fix all that .
 another member of my species ,  i see !
 this whole thread has made me laugh again and again .
 prepare to see it reposted every two months from now on :/
 steve and the camera crew quickly scamper to a corner ,  in a  &apos;legs out arms out wide stance &apos; .
 steve: looks liyk these two are boutta have a bit of a tumble .
 might wanna give them some space .
 u/thirty_helens_agree s begins hissing madly ,  teeth bared as she claws at his face .
 mr thirsty helen bounce-hobbles a few meters away ,  head low .
 naw look at the size of that sheilah ,  if ya see  &apos;er in the wild ,  its best to give the girl plenty of space ,  as she can rip ya to shreds .
 mr thirty helen roles onto his back ,  submissively .
 ya see its  &apos;ere that the female primarily brings the food back to  &apos;er dependent cubs an mate .
 wit claws like that ya really don &apos; wanna get on the wrong side of  &apos;er ,  thats for sure .
 much more along the lines of jumping down on the couch next to you or throwing you in a back hug .
 have to let the camera see your pretty face !
 look at this right beaute !
 this shiny coat means she &apos;s been gettin &apos; good brushes lately ,  good girl .
 eatin &apos; well ,  aren &apos;t ya ?
 looks like she was here sunning herself ,  this particular species is known to lack vitamin d ,  so we &apos;re just gonna to put her right back in her lawn chair to keep warm .
 crikey ,  what a find .
 god spany mcjiggles ,  that was really heartwarming .
 i’m genuinely happy that you’ve found happiness !
 spread the joy ,  friend :)
 username checks out
 lol upvote cuz im rewatching the office as i write this .
 i just got to dwights mussolini speech
 steve approaches the bedroom quietly and low ,  beckoning the camera crew to come closer .
 this  &apos;ere &apos;s a gentle little bugga ,  not much of a fighta an mighty gentle like .
 very slow reaction ,  like this:  .
 steve begins waving his hands rapidly in front of the screen .
 u/hilaryswankisnothot has no reaction .
 ya see ,  these fellas like it where its nice an warm ,  where they &apos;ll lie for days at a time just feeding on the light .
 they need this light ,  or they &apos;ll die off .
 while not particuarly dangerous ,  if ya take them from their natural habitat ,   .
 steve readies a metal catchpole .
 in a flash ,  he switches the office to c-span .
 hilaryswank goes into an immediate frenzy ,  clawing at the air and howling .
 steve reacts swiftly ,  netting hilaryswank by the neck with a catchpole as she thrashes about madly .
 qwight a fighta ,  ain &apos;t she ?
 after minutes ,  hilaryswank is subdued ,  mad fear in her eyes as she drools on the ground .
 so rememba ,  while dey may seem gentle loik ,  if ya startle them ,  yer gonna be in fer a bad time .
 wow honestly i like that more than i thought possible
 seriously tho thanks ,  it was a ton of fun to make dumb jokes on an hour i had off ,  and am damn glad you enjoyed some of them .
 have a good one man ,  you made my day .
 obiviously you never watched south park .
 he put everything in a head lock
 i am so sorry for your loss .
 how are you doing today ?
 no ,  you &apos;re a beaut !
 that’s steve urwin to you ,  pal .
 at least you aren &apos;t the one thinking it might not be so bad to be pinned down by steve irwin .
 all of those years watching him paid off somewhere aside from the love of animals and conservation .
  &apos;oh this ones a beauty !
 look at those tears !
 i can just see two crocs discussing it now: .
  &apos;why didn &apos;t you bite him !
  &apos;he said i was gorgeous !
 why can &apos;t you ever say things like that !
 his was the very best and really only memorable comment i can recall from all world leaders ,  celebrities and people after 911 .
  he simply said ,   &apos;i &apos;m sincerely sorry mate .
  &apos;  and he said it with great sadness on his face .
 i &apos;m crying right now thinking about it .
 i cant think of a positive for myslef but steve &apos;s amazing my caring and gentle heart would .
 and that makes me happy knowing people like him exist
  &apos;don &apos;t worry little fella ,  i &apos;m not gonna hurt ya .
 what a beauuuuty ,  look at that gorgeous moustache .
 red rocket red rocket
 breaks down in tears  &apos;you were my hero growing up ,  i wanted to be a marine biologist but i was never good at school .
 i want someone to pick me up and give me a little rub :(
 ive been having a few tough nights ,  like really tough depression nights .
 thanks for this .
 god damn onion ninjas !
 hope you &apos;re alright there ,  friend .
 and your steve conscience is right .
 it would be a far darker world if you left it .
 hang the fuck in there .
 posts like yours are the best .
 that’s enough ,  i hope ,  for today .
 cries in  &apos;this is so relatable what the fuck put the feels back &apos;
 i did something similar that i can &apos;t even bring myself to fully explain .
  i don &apos;t think i really recognized how lonely i was .
 while this comment may be a joke animal semen is in fact jarred and cooled for shipment .
 while i don &apos;t think there is a such thing as a cum bottling plant ,  there could be .
 saw either this one or one of your comments on r/usernamechecksout
 thank you for reminding me that steve irwin referred to females as sheilahs
 if you knew how hard i laughed at this .
 you &apos;d be proud of yourself
 i bet he didn &apos;t even tip on that  &apos;sup &apos; message ,  he &apos;s never gonna make it .
 u/squeeeeenis isn’t poisonous ,  it’s toxic .
 this is great ,  oh man
 the only reason i didn &apos;t burst out laughing at this is because here it &apos;s half past ten in the evening
 this is one of the most insulting things i’ve ever read
 talk about the most unnecessary adjective we’ve seen today .
 or just  &apos;a dorito &apos;
 nor is it  &apos;up to 5 &apos; .
 we all know that is the bare minimum

 i was born with these blazing locks
 20 minutes ,  i feel your pain .
 i hear people willing go into these beds that have nothing but uv light !
 so ,  i don &apos;t exactly trust the light of the full moon not to burn me .
 btw ,  when you run out of room for shoulder freckles ,  they invade your arms .
 ask me how i know .
 just wait till you start experiencing the second part .
 i write curled up on the floor next to my two year olds bed at three in the morning (she &apos;s ill and require constant soothing ,  no we don &apos;t know if it &apos;s corona) .
 my wife is in our bedroom with a squeeling three week old .
 i fell asleep during a lecture today .
 not one i sat as a student .
 a lecture i was giving .
 as an australian ,  it could use some work .
 however the cockney accent was supposedly the main english influence on the development of the australian accent .
 i was looking for this comment .
 hagrid is the fictional version of steve irwin .
 love how i can hear it in my head in both of their voices
 wholesome is the most realistic version of steve irwin .
 there isn &apos;t a person alive i hate more than me lol
 that made me a lot sad .
 i started welling up a little at the end ngl .
 i need to smoke some weed now .
 fellow chia pet here .
 hairy men feel gross because society tells us men are supposed to be hairless now .
 i &apos;m not gonna shave my whole body to fit an unrealistic standard of male body image .
 thanks but i &apos;m not as down as this makes out .
 just had a shitty day yesterday and was sort of venting .
 given the state of the world atm ,  i &apos;m really not doing so bad compared to many people .
 first world problems ,  eh ?
 nice of you to reach out though ,  that &apos;s the kind of compassion we need more than ever right now ,  i hope you &apos;re doing okay .
 it &apos;s an american tradition .
 all through my kids’ childhood we would periodically have “medieval dinner” which was me tearing a loaf of italian bread in half and giving them that with a hunk of cheese and a hunk of unsliced salami .
 it was a surprisingly popular meal .
 nah ,  it &apos;s gotta sliced ,  and somewhat thin at that ,  but then i go to town .
 audible gasp from the dilapidated bachelor pad
 this whole thread is /r/suicidebywords followed by /r/murderedbywords .
 stop ,  he &apos;s already dead !
 snap on should be selling 10mm sockets in 6-packs ,  .
 12-packs ,  24-packs ,  and the costco edition 36-pack .
 well to be fair ,  if i was poked with a stick i’d be kinda pissed too .
 dont threaten me with a good time !
 i dont understand how the southpark clip isnt the top comment .
 steve knows redditors like head pats
 steve knows what he’s doing
 thanks for that beautiful description .
 except i wouldn &apos;t vomit; i hold my alcohol like an expert .
 i don &apos;t think anyone repyling to this question is ok
 just makes me miss him more
 i hope steve tosses snacks at the mated pair
 i love the things that you do
 i &apos;m hungover ,  but other than that i &apos;m grand .
 dick move by michael for not staying
 we are warriors !
 blood alone moves the wheels of history !
 now ,  i &apos;m gonna jam my thumb in it &apos;s butthole ,  and its gonna get really pissed off !
 better than the past few but still in the dumps nonetheless .
 thanks fellow redditor for asking ,  you made my day .
 you’re all beauts
 been scrolling for the first instance of this just so i could read it in his voice .
 thought it was steve orwin
 god ,  i &apos;d love to get pinned down by any of the irwins .
 the plus side to being bi .
 something to tell your sheila ,  “got pinned by steve irwin once ,  man called me a beaut ,  wasn’t wrong” .
 too bad they &apos;re crocodile tears .
 i can see this as a far side cartoon
 he was such a great dude
 this entire post is hitting way too hard; i still feel a sense of profound sadness whenever i think about steve .
 he had such a big effect on me growing up .
 i have a bestie like that- she can see the best traits buried  in a dumbdik !
 i &apos;ve called lots of her exes that ,  in fact xd    .
 ok that made me chuckle
 glad i wasn &apos;t drinking anything ,  that might have been messy .
 you are important .
 you matter and you deserve to feel happiness .
 better days will come ,  even if they seem a lifetime away
 i &apos;ve been there myself lately .
 i hope you get to feeling better and power through it .
 as lonely as depression feels ,  we &apos;re never alone .
 i used to do this ,  but people kept coming over and asking me  &apos;are you ok ,  little buddy ?
  &apos; and that would annoy me because i didn &apos;t actually want to be around people ,  i just didn &apos;t want to feel lonely .
 bruh i went through such a phase when i was 11 years old that i walked through the fields near my school crying and screaming my crushes name .
 it &apos;s like i &apos;ve been starved for deep emotional contact and understanding with people for so long .
 i &apos;m only just realizing it now that i &apos;ve been in isolation .
 awwww guys i wish i had known the little versions of you guys .
 i woulda been your friend !
 nope ,  i guess i used this as an opportunity to pretend to be my own friend and when someone actually gave me attention i moved out .
 i used to pull this on a regular basis with different places .
 once in the park pulling the same ole shit ,  i saw this boy trying to be cool jumping off the fence .
 his pants got stuck while he hung upside down with half of his butt facing me .
 part of me wanted to leave but this time i decided to reach out and help him .
 we soon became good friends .
 the cum bottling plant .
 your mom got fired for drinking on the job ,  remember ?
 what ,  you think cum just ends up in convenient ,  resealable bottles by magic ?
 the cum bottling plant
 don &apos;t get it mixed up with the white sauce
 towards the end of his tenure at the cum bottling plant they used to get huge purchase orders from his rescue habitats all over australia .
 general aussie thing as well ,  i think
 i almost never laugh loud but i full belly laughed at “sup”
 they were two of the best back to back comments i &apos;ve seen .
 bruh ,  hes venomous .
 poison if you bite him and you die ,  venomous if he bites you and you die .
 the toxicity is what gets ya in both situations .
 almost is an adverb though .
 distribute some free literature .
 the irish really are the damned .
 i have a freckle for every soul i &apos;ve taken .

 thanks for starting my day with a lil prejudice
 a couple of gs ,  an r and an e ,  an i and an n
 prejudice by tim minchin .
 dunkin &apos; their ginger nuts in my ginger tea ,  yeah .
 and asking if they can call me ginge ,  and i say: .
  &apos;i don &apos;t think that &apos;s appropriate !
 who put you in that nutshell ?
 how &apos;d they get a nutshell big enough to fit you ?
 sounds enticing ,  lol .
 oh my ,  i &apos;m sorry i laughed at the last part ,  that sounds like something i would do .
 i hope your wee one feels better soon and that &apos;s it &apos;s not corona and you all get some well deserved rest .
 lot of impoverished londoners sentenced to transportation ,  and even the ones who came to aus by choice were broadly from se england over anywhere else ,  so cockneys aplenty and estuary for a relative minority .
 obviously it &apos;s been centuries for the accents to drift apart but the common roots are pretty clear .
 steve irwin definitely played up his accent too ,  though .
 as far as i can recall ,  irwin almost definitely vocalized h &apos;s at the beginning of words .
 if you really want to do the classic aussie accent ,  you &apos;ve gotta low key slip a number 19 in there somehow .
 many males you find in the wild with this condition will try to compensate .
 op put this ,  and this is how i &apos;d write it .
 menny mayuls you foind in the woild wiff this condishin ,  will troi to cohmpensayt .
 tbf cockneys love the word cunt too .
 or in their tongue  &apos;kant &apos; .
 i never put it together until now
 my daughter is the mini version of both .
 she was near tears when harry killed the basilisk (“the poor snake !
 it was so cute !
 ”) and she’s absolutely obsessed with twoey ,  the giant killer alien plant from little shop of horrors .
 like she coos at how adoooooorable it is .
 she is always saying she feels she’s a tiny hagrid .
 we’ve been meaning to show her some steve irwin !
 hagrid is the fictional magical version of steve irwin .
 newt scamander is too
 screw full games ,  i just want a hd remake of ps1 hagrid .
 no one lets me down more .
 sounds like a productive mindset
 it &apos;s sad because it &apos;s true
 got us in the feels bro
 as a sheila ,  i think chest hairs and beards are sexy af
 idk about you but i just like having a beard
 a man of cultured milk ,  i see
 canadian tradition too !
 audible gasp from his weight in pudding
 thank you ,  i guess .
 even if it was by steve irwin ?
 oi ,  that’s his mating call !
 so rare to hear it in the wild
 “you see ,  one of the reasons it’s so docile despite me putting a fair bit of weight on the fella ,  is because i’m distributing my weight over his body which simulates the feel of a weighted blanket ,  which for these beauts is incredibly calming .
 or something like that
 ah my mistake ,  lemme correct that: .
 steve gets real low to the ground ,  real low in a whisper ,  as he shifts his way through a den of drunks .
  &apos;ere we are among the drunk types ,  found on nearly every continent in the wilds .
 but if ya get real close like ,  ya can spot the difference  &apos;ere .
 steve shines a mini-flashlight on the face of a hockey-jersey clad girl .
 she immediately barfs a concoction of white wine and chicken nuggets .
 naw this is a defense mechanism rite ,  she stores  &apos;er toxins in a sack to scare off unwanted predators .
 but if you see on a fella like this ,  .
 shines mini flashlight on u/jacksagain ,  who waves his arms and groans .
 this  &apos;eres an irish-type .
 wit no natural predators except the english ,  these fellas store their toxins to turn it into nutrients .
 steve pats jacksagain &apos;s head as he returns to slumber .
 what’s the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman ?
 holy shit ,  i love your username .
 my favorite threat to my buddies is a falcon punch to the balls ,  so your name speaks to me .
 therefore none of us are a beaut .
 do you see what you’ve done .
 i &apos;m with you there ,  stranger .
 i &apos;m with you there .
 bindi is fuckin &apos; hot .
 i misread that as an “army of irwins” .
 you have to say it with a flawless australian accent or it won &apos;t work .
 i wish i was as clever as you .
 take my upvote and leave .
 starring topher grace and dan fogler .
 stop spilling the crocodile milk
 thanks man i needed to hear that .
 its been a couple of years since i &apos;ve been waiting for better days but there have been fleeting moments that give me some hope .
 this hit me in the feels .
 when you are little you don’t understand it yet .
 at least i didn’t .
 the ever-present struggle of the introvert: being among many is too taxing ,  too suffocating ,  and yet being among none ,  for too long ,  is the same .
 that’s why i used to stick to crying myself to sleep at night in my room ,  but when my parents tried to get me to join the rest of the family i’d refuse .
 then cry more feeling twice as alone .
 i am in this comment and i don &apos;t like it .
 i have never really heard someone express my issue so well .
 i &apos;ll bet that even so ,  it might be for entirely different reasons lol .
 i wanted certain people to love me .
 not just anyone ,  and anyone else  &apos;trying to help &apos; was annoying af .
 reach out and help him .
 i have nothing to say .
 this line speaks for itself .
 my phone background says  &apos;no one is coming to save you .
 its always been just you .
  &apos; a reminder that the only person who will help me is myself
 such low hanging fruit ,  but still hilarious
 she told me she worked on a dairy farm !
 always wondered where those bottles of cum i get delivered to my door every morning come from .
 understandable have a good day
 yeah you might drink the white sauce by mistake
 that cleared it up !
 a few years ,  one of my internet friends from the uk kept talking about how he was trying to get himself a bird ,  and how all his other friends had birds already ,  and so on .
 so for a period of about six weeks ,  i thought he was really wanting to get a pet parrot or something .
 so you can imagine my surprise and confusion when he started talking about all the birds he &apos;d have sex with when he was in university .
 yeah ,  turns out people from the uk refer to girlfriends as  &apos;birds &apos; .
 much like yee haw and y’all in the states - it’s a thing for people of a certain age ,  and certain regions .
 it’d sound as weird coming from a melbourne millenial as yee haw y’all would coming from a brooklyn millenial .
 yeah ,  nah ,  oh ,  nah ,  yeah .
 sheila’s are a top sort that bring you a tinny while you’re watchin’ sport .

 system of a down really ruined the word toxic for me .
 i cannot hear that word and not follow it up with ,   &apos;of our city ,  of our ciiitttiiiiiieeeeesssss &apos; in my head .
 i just got rickrolled by reddit .
 my favorite saying about the irish is “being irish ,  he had an abiding sense of tragedy ,  which sustained him through temporary periods of joy”  and i don’t think i’ve every related so well to anything
 but they got all the whiskey in the world in the bargain ,  so what &apos;s a soul compared to that ?
 irish i had a soul
 between alcoholism and good hearted spirits i never met one that wasn’t ok in my book .
 still don’t have one for yourself
 if you don &apos;t have a tinge of the ginge in your minge .
 this all makes me very uncomfortable .
 if you feed a pistachio tree exclusively with steroids ,  the pistachios can grow to be 11 feet tall ,  and the shell grows with it .
 this is against the geneva convention ,  though ,  since the pistachios typically gain sentience and start working out at gyms ,  without racking the weights after use .
 this always ends with the military having to launch a full assault on the pistachio due to just how sick their gains are .
 id like to know too
 i mean ,  anyone who tells you kids are the greatest are lying to some degree .
 also kids are the greatest and i wouldn &apos;t trade the experience for anything .
 you should have some .
 they both ways talk about how good natured every animal/creature is .
 same ,  and now i &apos;m bothered that i missed it .
 past me is a real dbag .
 future me is just a hater .

 no natural predators except the english  .
 fuck ,  that sent me sides into orbit
 it &apos;s 6:39 am ,  i &apos;ve been awake for 2 days ,  have a massive day ahead ,  & i &apos;m losing my shit at all your posts u/yourdailydevil   .
 when everyone’s a beaut \evil laugh  no one will be
 i completely understand .
 i &apos;ve had more bad days than good for about a decade .
 a lot of darkness in that time and i &apos;m only 35(f) .
 but the good helps me keep going .
 the birth of my niece ,  then my nephew a few years later are two of the biggest reasons i have hope because even on the days they are having a grouchy day ,  tantrums or attitude ,  i still love every single second with them .
 my cat is still with me and super healthy at 12 years old .
 i have a great relationship with my mom and can literally talk to her about anything ,  including my absolute asshole of a father .
 (they &apos;re still married) .
 my family adopted a dog from the shelter rather serendipitously and she had been abused and then abandoned .
 in 7 months time she &apos;s gone from a dog who was terrified constantly and didn &apos;t know how to play with toys to a running ,  tail-wagging ,  toy-loving ball of fun and she makes my heart happy .
 so many things are still shit and won &apos;t change anytime soon ,  but i love my animals ,  i love my niece and nephew ,  i love my mom and brother .
 i have great friends and while we &apos;re all in bad places these days ,  we talk every day and that helps so much .
 hold on to those little things and never skip a chance to tell the people in your life how you feel about them .
 wait i feel like this and i don’t understand it yet .
 should say i’m autistic
 feels weird to see someone have a similar experience .
 i cried all the time over being alone and i still turned everyone away anyways when i &apos;d be asked to do things .
 i still don &apos;t even know why .
 well if you could learn to love a little more gently you might be able to find lasting companionship a little easier .
 i wonder where he grabbed him by
 mine says   &apos;don &apos;t panic &apos; in large ,  friendly letters .
 yes ,  she did prefer the elderly comedians to anything else .
 idk he really elevated it imo .
 he picked the low hanging fruit ,  strapped it to a rocket and sent that motherfucker to the gd moon .
 hey ,  don &apos;t talk about my fruits like that .
 didn &apos;t you find it weird there were only bulls at the dairy farm ?
 what can i say except you &apos;re welcome !
 did you know that when pigeons have sex they die ?
 well the one i fucked did .
 yeehaw isn’t a thing anyone says .
 y’all though is all through the south and midwest .
 there is so much about aussie slang that sounds sexist and racist ,  but is usually just wholesome
 for me ,  it &apos;s britney spears .
 now i have that song stuck in my head again .
 i was hoping that was going to take me to a real sub that automatically redirected me to the video .
 the man could turn a hell of a phrase .
 not entirely sure why ,  but the first person i thought of reading this description was dylan moran &apos;s character in the show black books .
 did we just become best friends ?
 or your fringe ;)
 must be a big nut .
 the truest sentiment of a parent .
 it’s the greatest ,  and most rewarding ,  ass-kicking ,  exhausting ,  stressful job i have ever had ,  but ,  i wouldn’t trade it for anything .
 nothing worth having comes easy .
 i say this as a father to a toddler that sleeps through the night and today decided to screech loudly all the way home from daycare because we wouldn &apos;t let her take home her cup that stays at daycare .
 the cup stopped coming home on monday .
 welcome to parenting .
 my understanding is that it’s the 2 .
 5-13yo part and the 20+ part that makes the 0-2 and the 14-19 parts worth it .
 a problem shared is a problem halved ;) .
 joking aside ,  i don &apos;t want kids exactly because i don &apos;t experience things that way .
 without experiencing all that good stuff it will be like prison .
 sleep deprived prison .
 i would be one of those dads who will be relieved the weekend is over and he can go back to work ,  awful as that might sound .
 as someone in the midst of  &apos;trying &apos; .
 no not right now .
 this gives me such mixed feelings lol .
 sums up essentially what i &apos;m nervous about
 snape ,  severus snape
 guys ,  i think i solved world peace !
 we get all the world leaders together and serve cheese trays ,  and boom !
 i rub my hands because i know what goes into the pudding
 with the amount of time i spend on reddit during work hours ,  it was kind of inevitable .
 aha thank you so much ,  that means a lot !
 now get some damn sleep and good luck tomorrow !
 one of my favorite movie references
 you crave attention because your lacking it where you should have it such as parents ,  so you do things like sit in a park and act sad .
 people ask you if your sad but you don’t want their attention you want whoever’s attention your missing and so it causes this sorta anger .
 you want to not be lonely but not the attention of some random .
 when i was younger this was very confusing to me because even when i got what i “wanted” someone’s attention it’s not what i actually wanted so it can cause anger and frustration .
 i think i &apos;ve pin pointed it to me feeling them suddenly reaching out is too little too late; the damage (near constant emotional neglect) is done .
 i especially feel this as an adult ,  when my mother has seen the error of her ways and is begging for forgiveness and is trying to show affection .
 i want to forgive ,  but her attempts at affection disgust me .
 i can &apos;t help it .
 too little and way too late .
 he’s just an ordinary demigod !
 mighty polite of you there ,  kind redditor .
 shit thanks ,  had no clue what that guy said
 now i &apos;m singing britney right with you .
 i haven &apos;t heard that song in forever and i &apos;m loving all the  nostalgia .
 brb ,  heading to youtube .

 what a legendary comment .
 that’s definitely gonna make it to the reddit museum .
 and that guy got 2800 awards and almost 130k upvotes .
 the days are long .
 so ,  so long sometimes .
 but damn if the years aren’t just too short as well .
 the best way i have seen it described is that it raises the greatest of good times but worsens the worst of bad times .
 i didn’t even start liking my daughter til she was 13 and i could have a fairly adult conversation with her .
 now she’s 19 and in college & is a nationally ranked powerlifter with 24 state records and is simply the best human being aside from still being a dirty little shit that can’t clean up after herself ever !
 i mean i &apos;m excited to go to work because we have a  &apos;quiet room &apos; i can sleep in during my lunch break .
 if you wind up having kids i &apos;ll give you the single best advice about parenting you &apos;ll ever heard .
 i got it from my mom and she has nine kids .
  &apos;don &apos;t listen to all the advice you get &apos; everyone and anyone has an opinion about parenting .
 do what &apos;s right for you and your kid .
 accept that sometimes you &apos;ll fuck up .
 i felt like the worst dad ever this monday because i forgot that your supposed to pack both a breakfast and a lunch for kindergarten .
 it was okay we simply dropped by a store on the way and got some off the shelf kids meal .
 not the best ,  but it beats having a hungry kid .
 just do your best and you &apos;ll likely be fine .
 now that &apos;s just asking for another world war .
 i &apos;m french ,  we &apos;re very specific about what is cheese and how to consume it .
 the german cut their cheese incorrectly and american people make aerosol  &apos;cheese &apos; and put melted industrial cheese in everything and pretend that &apos;s not breaking the geneva convention (if it doesn &apos;t then it should) .
 i rub the thing that produces the pudding

 shucks guys i came in here to laugh at people getting headlocked by steve irwin not cry about being neglected
 thank you for this insight ,  its sharp and personally meaningful .
 i &apos;m having a real big aha moment .
 thanks for explaining what 3 years of therapy couldn’t
 i was abandoned by one parent and abused by the other .
 this puts into words how i have felt my entire life .
 at this point my anger burns with the rage of 1 , 000 suns .
 it’s like a renewable fuckin resource .
 counseling helps ,  and the weed helps me fall asleep ,  but that frustration and anger hurts me deep down to my soul .
 i’m gonna take a picture of your comment and show it to my counselor .
 it’s nice to be able to finally have words to express this .
 i wish i could give you an award for helping me .
 i have a very strong memory of standing in my bedroom and wrapping my own arms around myself to try to feel what it would be like to be hugged .
 i was probably 13 or 14 .
 i tried having sex with any of the local boys who were willing (of course they were willing they were also 13 or 14) but they always pretended that they didn’t know me after and it took me a long time to figure out that i was looking for affection in all the wrong places .
 it turns out it was far easier to allow yourself to be used for sex pretty much anonymously in the local woods but none of them were willing to hug me .
 i’m grown and married now (my husband knows about what happened i have had all the tests and thankfully there’s no physical damage from that time and i had lots of therapy to process what it all meant) i have a son who is hugged and kissed a million times a day whether he likes it or not .
 while there is breath in my body he will never feel lonely and isolated like i did because even on the day a queue basically formed i was still lonely .
 thank you for this .
 i &apos;ve always wondered what caused my issue of not wanting to be lonely ,  while simultaneously shutting people out .
 thinking on it ,  it &apos;s exactly because of this .
 i was always the 2nd kid ,  and then i became the 3rd favorite for my dad when my half brother was born .
 only attention i get from either parent is to ask me about my older brother 90% of the time .
 i &apos;m 20 years old and still couldn &apos;t quite crack it until now .
 i relate entirely .
 my dad vanished from my life for 8-10 years when my mom got custody of me and my brother .
 it wasn &apos;t by her doing either ,  he was allowed to call ,  write ,  visit ,  whatever .
 he lived in a different province and spent our last week there telling us he &apos;d see us as much as possible and he &apos;d call when we had a phone and did all the things we loved with us .
 some years we got a card or a call for christmas or a birthday .
 my brother got money to go towards sports camps and such ,  i wasn &apos;t interested so i got none of that .
 he reached back out and started to connect more when we were older ,  but it felt too late .
 i don &apos;t even hate him ,  i think it &apos;s more resentment .
 i still love him and i enjoy the contact and seeing him and hearing from him ,  but at the same time i wonder so often why he didn &apos;t want to be involved with us for so long .
 between frequent calls ,  texting ,  attempts to get us to visit as well as him visiting ,  gifts ,  etc i feel like he knows it too and is trying to make up for it .
 then with my mom ,  i &apos;ve always had her but she worked constantly ,  and my older brother was always more of a troublemaker and athlete while i was a pretty quiet and subdued student ,  so he got the majority of her attention and money .
 she &apos;s starting to realize how i &apos;ve felt of late ,  and maybe it &apos;s my fault for never telling her how i felt ,  but more often than not my brother got major favorite treatment still .
 it just makes me more naturally distant to most people in my family ,  honestly .
 it just feels like they weren &apos;t interested in me ,  so i have no reason to give them my time .

  &apos;how can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese ?
 - charles de gaulle
 everyone seems to think aerosol cheese is a normal thing we all eat in america .
 i think it just stands out in people &apos;s minds because it &apos;s one of the most horrifying things we &apos;re created .
 it &apos;s not an everyday staple ,  it &apos;s either a novelty or a sign that someone really isn &apos;t in the mood to cook .
 that said ,  french cheese kicks ass ,  i ate so much quality brie in just a few short days over there .

 it’s my personal experience so take it as is .
 hopefully my insight was helpful .
 took me years to realize it .
 hey i’m just saying it how it was for me .
 tbh the fact that anyone can get any help from one of my comments it’s amazing .
 be kind to yourself have have a good one .
 i &apos;m glad you wrote this out and shared .
 i just wanted to comment on the last bit - dont blame yourself .
 as a fairly new parent of two boys ,  i am constantly thinking about and concerned with giving more attention to one than the other .
 it is very easy to  &apos;accidentally &apos; give more attention to one child over the other because one might need it more .
 in your case ,  your brother was a troublemaker and you were a good kid so naturally your mother needed to give more attention to your brother to keep him straight and in check .
 however ,  even granting that ,  its on the parent to recognize this and compensate .
 i have to give way more attention to my older child because he &apos;s capable of getting into more crap ,  but after a particularly taxing day when i realize that i &apos;ve spent my whole day on him ,  i reflect on this at night time after they &apos;ve gone to bed and make a mental note to consciously put more effort toward ensuring the younger one gets a bunch of attention the next day .
 lastly ,  i &apos;m not saying your mother is at fault either .
 this was likely completely unintentional and accidental on your moms part .
 it is so incredibly easy for things like this to get lost in translation when you are working a full time job to provide for your children and then come home and continue to provide for your children in terms of attention and affection .
 hopefully this helps

 at face value i would think it &apos;s a good idea ,  but i saw someone pointed out a rather logical reason why it wouldn &apos;t: basically the wealthier representatives could wait out the poorer ones .
 a better solution would be to cancel recess for everybody involved .
 just to clarify ,  recess removing recess means that the senate cannot adjourn .
 i would prefer that congress can &apos;t leave the capitol until a budget is passed .
 i think that could turn into a game of big bank little bank .
  the wealthiest politicians could just wait out those with less money in order to get their way .
 the whole reason they don’t already is because then the richer congressmen would use it against the poorer ones .
 i &apos;d rather change the law so that not passing the budget defaulted to a continuing resolution .
  there is no reason a shut down should happen .
 no ,  but i &apos;m also against allowing critical federal employees to go without pay .
 i think if they &apos;re required to work ,  we should be required to pay them .
 regarding the  &apos;why not &apos; of politicians - we &apos;re finally starting to get some who aren &apos;t coming from wealth .
 i &apos;d hate for those people to get pushed out because they can &apos;t afford to be politicians .
 i want to see more representation of working and middle class people in our government .
 obligatory update: thanks for the silver ,  kind internet stranger !
 functionally - you would need an amendment rather than just a law .
 congressional members aren &apos;t paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked ,  but as their status as members .
 more importantly ,  members of congress are constitutional officers .
 the president (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the constitution .
 as such ,  they &apos;re all constitutionally entitled to pay .
 article 1 ,  section 6 of the constitution: .
 the senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for their services ,  to be ascertained by law ,  and paid out of the treasury of the united states .
 no law ,  varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives ,  shall take effect ,  until an election of representatives shall have intervened .
 it also functionally wouldn &apos;t do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (aoc for example) .
 the shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that need that money imminently ,  which is not the vast majority of congress and certainly not the president .
 so that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort .
 i personally like the canadian system .
  if their legislature ever fails to pass a budget ,  they &apos;ve failed at their primary responsibility of running the government .
  failing to pass a budget is treated as a failure of confidence ,  and a general election is triggered whereby every parliamentarian must face their voters and rejustify why they should have a job .
 not saying that would force all u .
 legislators to act ,  but it would probably incentivize enough to avoid stupid shit like this latest shutdown .
 this is a terrible idea .
 for one thing ,  most of them would not care .
 my senators are worth millions of dollars ,  they don &apos;t even notice their salary .
 for another thing ,  some congresspeople do really depend on their salary .
 this is their only source of income .
 see the problem here ?
 if we cut off their pay then the rich congressmen have a weapon to use against the poorer congressmen .
 there would be more government shutdowns and threats of shutdowns ,  and  &apos;vote with me or lose your paycheck &apos; would become a viable ,  common tactic for the wealthier members of congress .
 a better idea would be to just stop voting for idiots .
 or ,  more applicable to this audience: fucking vote .
 thank you for the gold and silver ,  and the great discussions !
 this shutdown is extremely frustrating for everyone ,  and there are no easy answers .
 but the more we talk about potential solutions ,  the more likely we are to find some that work .
 this simple argument against it is that newer or less corrupt congressmen would be the only ones to suffer .
 if you &apos;re making 500k selling your soul to a big corporation ,  than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought .
 mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer .
 so this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members .
 although why should they be exempt from suffering the way tsa workers or prison workers do ?
 i feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed ,  if a budget isn &apos;t agreed upon ,  than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget .
 if those 3 months go by and still no movement is made ,  then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency .
 something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president .
 this later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it &apos;s self to kick a sitting president out of power ,  such as republicans during the obama administration ,  and i suspect democrats during the trump administration .
 additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise .
 there should be no vacations ,  time off ,  or excuses with the exception of terminal illness .
 if a member of congress fails to show up ,  they would effectively be removed from congress ,  and if the sitting president or vice president is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget .
 i don &apos;t think the whole shutdown concept should even exist .
 budgets for projects with limited lifetimes should end ,  but operating budgets for ongoing departments and agencies should run along as-is until changed .
 there should never be a budget/no-budget conflict .
 it should be about how much we spend or don &apos;t spend on each individual thing .
 i support a law that ends shutdowns by continuing funding at previous levels if no new budget is passed
 i like the idea ,  but i don &apos;t think it would do a whole lot .
 first ,  there would be some constitutional issues with regards to the 27th amendment .
 i think you could phrase it so that you can comply with the 27th amendment ,  but there would certainly be court challenges that you would have to spend time and energy fighting .
 beyond that ,  though ,  senators ,  representatives ,  and presidents aren &apos;t really dependent on their salaries .
 the majority of them are either independently wealthy or make a ton of money off capital gains (ie investments) .
 i don &apos;t think holding their salary would change their standard of living in the slightest .
 i &apos;d be more in favor of holding an impromptu election like other countries do .
 if a congress can &apos;t work together to keep the govt open at a minimum ,  why not revote and whoever the public decides is the problem gets thrown out ?
 here &apos;s the thing: i only think it would work if you eliminated income from all sources ,  i .
 investments and outside revenue streams .
  basically you &apos;d have to put a freeze on the bank accounts of the politicians during a shutdown ,  and you &apos;d never have one again .
  at least half of our members of congress have such wherewithal that their congressional salary is meaningless to them .
 the cost of voting to shutdown the government should be the calling of new elections .
 how about instead of a  &apos;shut down &apos; ,  no one leaves the room until shit gets resolved ?
 and honestly ,  calling it a  &apos;shut down &apos; is such bullshit .
 all the employees (who aren &apos;t getting paid right now) still must come in to work .
 they still take taxes out of my paychecks .
 the military is still doing it &apos;s military thing .
 the border patrols are still patrolling .
 the usps is still shipping packages and mail .
 if the government was really shut down ,  none of that stuff should be going on .
 corrupt politicians would have advantage over honest ones .
 honest ones might find it easier to get money illegitimately than to solve the shutdown problem ,  which corrupt politicians would love .
 i &apos;m generally in favor of the idea that congress should be bound by every law it passes .
  they get to use the things they pass for the rest of us: health care ,  the retirement ,  hiring practices ,  etc .
  no exceptions for the  &apos;special people &apos; .
  as others have said ,  the problem with anything that punishes senators financially is that it encourages wealthy people to get involved in politics ,  and discourages less wealthy ones - or leaves them dependent on wealthy patrons ,  which is even worse .
 instead ,  when the government fails to pass a budget ,  everything should continue at previous levels (maybe even automatically increasing for inflation .
 )  this is not ideal ,  but defaulting to the status quo is far superior to having everything grind to a halt - people who want to implement changes should have to get support for them and shouldn &apos;t be able to use shutting down the government as a cudgel to try and force them through .
 the tons of long term millionaire congressmen would love to hamstring the newly elected like eoc that truly depend on their salaries in such a way .
 knee jerk reaction is yes .
 but actually it would be more  leverage for a manufactured shutdown .
 yes ,  i also think they should have to purchase insurance through the same markets as everyone else .
 i also don &apos;t think they should be able to vote for their own raises .
 how about we don &apos;t pay taxes during a shutdown .
 i would rather we just do away with the debt ceiling bullshit and not allow congress and the president to use these continuing resolutions to hold the government (employees ,  services ,  etc) hostage .
 its a ridiculously a stupid policy and serves as nothing more than a manipulation and bargaining strategy .
 do your negotiating and bargaining while drafting the budget and then stick with it until the following fiscal year .
 procedures can be put in place for emergency funding of unexpected events such as extreme natural disasters .
 government shuts down they all get fired .
 see if that motivates them to work together .
 how about remove all government paid travel and remove all pay/benefits ?
 insane that the secret service protecting these officials are not being paid as they fly around on taxpayers expense .
 insane homeland security and other law enforcement personnel are not being paid while having to work .
 if there cannot be made a budget within two weeks ,  after two weeks elapse ,  approval from the president is no longer required to pass a budget .
 and two weeks after that ,  congress is dissolved for special elections for all seats that will be up for election at the next election .
 no ,  because this whole process is fucking stupid and shouldn &apos;t have to happen in the first place .
 if they can &apos;t pass a budget ,  last year &apos;s budget should roll over and take it &apos;s place .
 this crap is rediculous .
 the president should have to vacate the white house during a shutdown and be sequestered in a motel 6 with congress until everything is solved .
 everyone has to share beds .
 the government shouldn &apos;t even be shut down in the first place .
 there should be a law that just rolls over the previous year &apos;s budget if an agreement can &apos;t be reached on a new one .
 worse yet ,  the representatives whose lobbyists have the bigger pockets can keep them afloat .
 like you ,  i initially thought it would be a good idea .
 however ,  as many people have said ,  the wealthy representatives wouldn &apos;t care ,  while those not so wealthy representatives would struggle .
 trump already donates his 400k/yr salary anyways ,  so for the current president this proposal would have zero effect .
 the current speaker ,  pelosi ,  is worth $120 million ,  so the current proposal would be useless on her too .
 so this proposal would only hurt some of the current political figures and none of the important ones .
 more importantly ,  the wealthier ones won &apos;t care at all .
 if you &apos;ve got 10m in the bank ,  what &apos;s a couple months of paychecks ?
 she can &apos;t afford not getting paid .
 or better yet ,  prevent the speaker of the majority leader from being the sole person who can call a vote .
 mitch mcconnel has prevented the senate from voting on a bill that the senate approved 100-0 .
 no one person should have this power .
 6 days a week 8-10 hours a day ,  in a federal building with a published schedule ( at the end of the day is fine for security reasons) .
   the only exception would be when their district is declared a federal emergency due to a natural disaster or the like .
 make it a double whammy .
 this shutdown shit happens way too regularly .
 stop paying them and tell them they have to keep working - i mean ,  that &apos;s what happens to the government employees affected by this politicking .
 make it like how they select a pope - lock them in the capitol building until white smoke appears .
 edit holy shit guys i struck a nerve !
  i’m glad i’m not alone !
 it &apos;s not a bad idea ,  but we also have to include the president ,  since he has to sign it to make it law .
 like with papal election .
 lock them in and feed them nothing but bread & water until they do their job .
 not only can they not leave dc ,  they cannot leave a single building .
 if things go long enough ,  the president ,  vice president ,  and cabinet will all be added to the building .
 if it continues ,  the only food provided will be from taco bell .
 all but two bathroom stalls will be blocked off .
 we will have out budget ,  or they will be in as shitty a situation as they are leaving everyone else .
 and then after a week they have to hold bags of sand equaling 25% of their bodyweight over their heads for 15 minutes every hour until shit &apos;s resolved .
 yeah ,  the problem with taking away their pay is that it only encourages them to have additional forms of income (like bribes) .
 keeping congress (and the president) on what would effectively be house arrest would achieve the same effect without encouraging bribery .
 they should not be allowed any vacation of any kind until a budget is passed
 unfortunately i think this would lead to a lot of crappy budgets passed just so they can all go home .
 and the president .
 he doesn &apos;t get to say he will veto a current agreement ,  then leave .
 i don &apos;t think many care about the pay .
 most are very wealthy .
 bigger bank diplomacy
 apparently this is actually the exact reason that they still get paid during a shutdown ,  so the rich politicians can &apos;t hold the non-rich ones hostage over certain issues .
 (or so i have heard ,  maybe that &apos;s wrong) .
 it &apos;s been pointed out that almost everyone in congress is rich enough that a couple months without pay would have practically no impact at all .
 the  &apos;rule &apos; i mentioned seems outdated nowadays .
 yeah ,  this is my thinking as well .
  those with deep pockets and rich donors would have a leg up on dictating legislation ,  which we need less of not ,  more .
 i &apos;d be more supportive of a law that automatically sets an appropriation for federal employee salaries every year ,  regardless of any other operations appropriations .
 exactly ,  and i wouldn &apos;t want the little guy to feel strong-armed into something that may not be the right decision just because they wanted to pay rent .
 it &apos;s the same reason that fines for some crimes are an easy write off for the wealthy but can place the poor into debt slavery .
 big bank little bank .
 is this a real game like  &apos;playing cops & robbers &apos; or just an expression ?
   the easiest way to fix the issue would be to require that in the event of a government shutdown ,  a new election is triggered .
   i believe canada and numerous other democracies have this clause in their constitution .
  now i &apos;m with those who think they should stay in session until it &apos;s resolved .
  not saying no one can leave ,  but they don &apos;t get the  &apos;cover &apos; of not being in session .
  and the senate can vote to bring a spending bill to the floor for a vote if the majority leader is blocking it (looking at you ,  mitch ,  you asshat) .
 i &apos;ve never thought about this .
 in canada ,  if a situation like this happens ,  rather than a shutdown ,  an election is triggered .
 if the government can &apos;t do their job: govern ,  then everyone gets removed and we vote new people into office .
 this way ,  the government will avoid these situations at all costs .
 if you &apos;re putting pressure on your politicians to have to choose between  &apos;do the right thing &apos; and  &apos;get evicted from your house &apos; ,  it &apos;s not really a fair government .
 the rich and powerful senators who have been in power for decades won &apos;t notice the paychecks missing ,  it will be the first-term representatives who are actually trying to make a difference that will get hurt the most .
 instead of blackmail between congress and the president it &apos;ll be between the congress and congress .
 the wealth of congressmen would determine the bill .
 this would be quite the pickle 
 same exact reasons that benjamin franklin wanted a pro bono congress; he was rich and wanted his rich friends to help him govern as a defacto bourgeoise ruling class .
 yes ,  if we &apos;re passing laws about this that &apos;s the one i &apos;d vote for .
 no other country operates this way ,  there &apos;s no reason we have to 
 agreed completely on this .
 if they &apos;re being forced to work ,  they need to be paid .
 can you imagine working any other job where they forced you in and didn &apos;t pay you ?
 there would be an uproar .
 i feel like they should be allowed to delay pay increases .
 but they already have income agreements in place .
 regular wahes shouldn &apos;t be delayed because the government can &apos;t get their shit together .
 it should just be paid as it was before the shut down .
 combine that with a shutdown triggering either a lock down or reelection ,  and you really end up with the only ones losing out being those who are causing this shit .
 this would probably be a great thing for a dem to add to their running platform .
 ensured payment for all government workers during shutdowns .
 that would be a very sweet point for military .
 if i’m not mistaken ,  that’s why we started paying members of congress in the first place .
 so that working and middle class could afford to serve in government .
 except that would allow a minority party to force a new election in the senate anytime .
 but what if your constituents are electing you for the shut down .
 some constituents ,  like in my area ,  want the shut down in order to prevent trump for governing .
 and the ones who are struggling for money could be held hostage by the richer ones .
 suddenly you see shutdowns all the time and every time the poorer reps would have to capitulate after too long
 i don &apos;t think article 1 really applies since it says compensation is determined by law ,  but you make an interesting point about the 27th amendment .
 that wasn &apos;t the point of the 27th ,  but by the letter of it ,  it does seem to apply .
 i &apos;m not totally sure what judicial recourse would look like if such a law was challenged ,  though .
 can the courts compel the treasury to spend money that wasn &apos;t appropriated by congress ?
 that seems like a constitutional issue of its own .
 canada also keeps paying their workers during a shutdown .
 it’s just another day at the office because they keep getting paid .
 the next budget isn’t going to phase out essential services so there really is no reason to not keep paying people .
 the best idea is to force every single lawmaker to stay in washington dc .
 time is something everyone lacks .
 huh ,  i came into this thread thinking  &apos;oh great another agree-a-thon where op pretends to try and start debate over something on which 99 .
 99% of reddit already sides with him &apos; but your comment totally blindsided me .
 i never considered this angle for a moment .
 if i had posted this to r/changemyview ,  you would’ve just gotten delta from me .
 and remember that if your ability to live in a house or apartment is on the line ,  than you will likely look for other areas of income ,  and what is a very easy paycheck to get as a congressman/president ?
 taking a bribe for a big corporation or special interest group to vote a certain way .
 stopping the pay of congress could create more corrupt politicians due to them seeing it as a necessity .
 a better idea would be to just stop voting for idiots .
 the problem is some of these senators/representatives are giving their constituents exactly what they want .
  the core issue seems to be that their constituents are the idiots .
 ffs how many times have we seen people say they hate obamacare but like the aca ?
 i was going to say yes ,  but this is a good point .
 i &apos;ve now changed my opinion on this .
 thank you for the eye opener .
 in turn ,  i think we should have term limits .
 i &apos;m now interested in hearing your thoughts on this ?
 maybe you can offer a perspective i haven &apos;t thought of .
 how about we combine the above with making them unable to leave dc until a deal is made ?
 how about 8 hours a day ,  every day in session until an agreement is met .
 and let &apos;s also stop electing parties that weaponize shutdowns ,  yes ?
 this is the best argument against it .
 and the few who do need the pay check would also become a lot more susceptible to corruption ,  it’s a lot easier to take a bribe when it’s life or death .
 for example ,  i was just reading about how alexandria ocasio-cortez (didn &apos;t check spelling too lazy) ,  who is only 29 ,  couldn &apos;t even afford to ent an apartment in dc until after her term started officially and her salary came through .
 so congresspeople like her would end up in money hostage situation where they would become more likely to bend to the demands of  &apos;establishment &apos; senators and congresspeople .
 this is the issue with the election process entirely .
 whom ever you vote for can claim they’ll do as they campaign but once they’re in office ,  they can do as they damn well please .
 the system we have in place doesn’t work or more so ,  needs to reworked .
 i agree with this .
 there shouldn’t be any circumstance where people aren’t being paid and our government is shut down .
 it’s enraging that there are no repercussions for people that are literally using people’s livelihoods as a bargaining chip .
 right now the gop in the senate seems to be the biggest reason why nothing is happening ,  and it’s really annoying that politics have come to be viewed as a team sport ,  and if your “captain” is choosing a position ,  you just blindly support them .
 the dems need to be pushing back against mcconnell more and getting more gop senators to push back against him .
 i really hope that when these people come up for re-election people actually show up to the polls and vote someone else in .
 i don’t care what political party they vote for; we just need to get new people in there that might at least one shit about their constituents .
 in fact ,  it could lead to more corruption .
 the people in congress who are totally reliant on their salaries would suffer while those who take in money from  &apos;lobbying &apos; and other sources would weather the storm .
 in other words ,  it would hurt the people most likely to sympathize with the workers while not hurting those less likely to sympathize .
 it could also encourage congressmen to have external sources of income .
 i had the same thought ,  but the problem with that is then the well connected would be supported by special interests doing them favors .
 politicians will just reroute the funds to the bank accounts of either their spouses or one run by their lawyer when they see a shutdown coming ,  then we &apos;re back to square one .
 now there is an idea .
 the government shouldn’t be taking my money if they can’t pay the people that work for them .
 the usps is not appropriated .
 they are self funded through postage fees 
 that &apos;s the craziest part .
 i just read that different agencies have ordered people back to work without pay .
 honestly ,  that should be illegal itself .
 at least some are getting backpay ,  but not many can actually afford to work this long without pay like this .
 remove government travel .
 remove the politicians &apos; security detail .
 then let &apos;s see how long they hold out because they aren &apos;t getting their wall .
 the money in politics from lobbying is the issue .
 if we could somehow just be a democracy rather than treating politics like a business and see  &apos;lobbying &apos; for what it is ,  someome paying to push their own agenda ,  we would be a step closer to being able to do this .
 not as easy as it sounds though 
 \ a lot of other countries have something known as an opposition day ,  which means that the opposing party can do what they wish on that day .
 it helps for situation such as this where it would pass regularly but doesn &apos;t get past the majority leader .
 he blocked a vote on a bill that he approved ?
 are you sure about that ?
 i can &apos;t believe this thread of hundreds of comments exists without any top level comment pointing out that congress did their job and near-unanimously passed a budget .
 and it &apos;s literally on mcconnell and trump stopping it from passing .
 i almost wonder if this isn &apos;t another russia campaign .
 stir up a sentiment that congress needs to get punished .
 congress is not at fault for this shutdown ,  and it &apos;s ridiculous that this is even being discussed .
 this is all entirely on donald trump and mitch mcconnell .
 punish them ,  if looking for a guilty party .
 i think it can go even further .
  i work in a factory that regularly increases shifts to 12 hours when production isn &apos;t met for an extended time .
  why not do that to them ?
  12-hour days ,  6 days a week until things are figured out .
  take pay from them ,  too ,  and i bet the shutdown won &apos;t last another 2 days .
  i know some of those men are in there 70 &apos;s and 80 &apos;s ,  but i work with people at those ages and they can make it through 12 hours .
 i agree ,  however ,  i think we should make it 7 days not 6 .
 if politicians don &apos;t have a salary then what will end up happening is more rich politicians would end up representing america and it would hurt those young ,  less wealthy ,  politicians that actually represent their people more .
 have you not seen designated survivor ?
 this seems like a bad idea .
 putting all 535 members of congress + the president into the capital and keep them there until they have a plan to end the shut down sounds like the largest cluster fuck in all of american history and i’m so down .
 air it live on cspan/cnn/fox/nbc etc and wait for a punch to get thrown in truly american fashion
 true ,  but the congress could override a veto if they really wanted to .
 not entirely true .
   if the president takes no action at all ,  and ten days pass (not including sundays) ,  the bill becomes law without the president &apos;s signature -- as long as congress doesn &apos;t adjourn during that time .
 and they have to meet every day ,  including weekends .
 i heard elsewhere that in other countries there &apos;s an automatic re election when a budget fails to pass .
 that might also be a good incentive .
 to be fair ,  the president has been in dc for the majority of the shutdown ,  winter holidays included .
 except for official visits like meeting with troops in middle east on christmas .
 like with papal election .
 lock them in and feed them nothing but bread & water hamberders until they do their job .
 after that they sit in icebaths 
 all of a sudden ,  jeff probst becomes de facto president .
 we had a deficit of $800 billion and increased the national debt by more than a $1 trillion last year .
  they aren &apos;t exactly passing great budgets as it is .
 walk softly ,  carry a big bank
 when i clicked this thread i was like hell yea this should obviously be a law ,  but just hadn &apos;t thought of this .
 would be an awful idea for this alone .
 apparently this is actually the exact reason that they still get paid during a shutdown .
 actually the  &apos;exact &apos; reason is because their compensation is legally authorized by the constitution (article 1 ,  section 6 and the 27th amendment) ,  and is thus not reliant on annual appropriations bills .
  (to be nitpicky ,  the amount of their compensation is a matter of law .
 meanwhile everyone else is held hostage instead
 automation wage increases would be required ,  and it exists in many countries already .
 the us is one of the few first world countries whose minimum wage is not automatically adjusted for inflation every year ,  for example .
 there should be no connection between federal employees getting paid for work ,  and any other governmental issue .
 pay them ,  plain and simple .
 if you want a wall ,  or some other goal ,  find a way to fund it without doing it off the backs of the fed employees .
 if not ,  this will continue and get worse over time ,  with the potential of someone holding those workers hostage over a really bad idea (no matter what your political ideology is) .
 employers need to pay their employees .
 this is exactly what happened to a restaurant in my home city .
 it was owned by 3 partners and 2 of them didn &apos;t like the third .
 so they forced the restaurant to close for  &apos;renovations &apos; and just waited until the third guy was out of money and needed to sell his part of the business .
 then they reopened like nothing happened ,  the place is still the same .
 they didn &apos;t even actually renovate anything .
 also known as a regressive tax .
 in other words: being poor is expensive
 yeah ,  basically rich people are allowed to drive whatever speed they want .
 in middle school it was a game where people bet their cash against the other person &apos;s cash ,  and whoever had more money takes it all
 i have thought of this before ,  not knowing it already existed in other countries .
 my conclusion has been essentially that this introduces a risk of politically motivated shutdowns based on whoever which side can pin down the blame ,  and then get more seats .
 we are not that .
 we keep the legislative and executive separate .
 this is how things used to work in britain .
 if the government couldn &apos;t pass any legislation that they declared to be an  &apos;issue of confidence &apos; ,  and election would be triggered .
 the law was changed a few years ago ,  and now parliament is in deadlock .
 : &apos;( neither willing to pass the government &apos;s legislation nor hold an election .
 a vote of no confidence would be wonderful here !
 most countries do that ,  however ,  much of the us government operates under the assumption that people will be semi-reasonable and we have no plan b; hence the shutdown .
 big key difference in the uk is that the government (the executive) \has\ to have a majority in order to continue to be the government .
  therefore by definition the budget being presented already has an implied majority .
  if the budget fails (and in practice it \never\ does - the last time was in 1885 !
 ) then this would be treated as confidence vote and so lead to a general election .
  if the government didn &apos;t have a majority in practice it would never make it to a budget vote .
 the key difference with the us is that the various players - the president and both houses - are separately elected leading to a near permanent government coalition .
  so there &apos;s no implied majority before a budget is proposed .
 if congress can &apos;t pass a budget on time ,  the government is broken and needs to be replaced .
 we struggle to vote and that &apos;s every two years .
 can you imagine how much worse it would be if we had to vote once or twice or three times a year ?
 we don &apos;t have a prime minister ,  we have a separately elected president .
 he can veto the budget .
 if it doesn &apos;t pass because they veto it ,  that means the president would have the power to trigger re-elections for all congressmen .
 is this the one that has automatic budget cuts every 90 days until a budget is passed ?
 that seemed like a pretty large poison pill 
 i &apos;m british and i literally don &apos;t understand why slavery is apparently still a thing in the u .
 while i completely agree with you ,  i just want to point out that they &apos;ll get paid for all of their missing paychecks after the government reopens .
 the problem is that people living from paycheck to paycheck may starve before then .
 also a large portion of senators ,  representatives ,  and the executive branch are independently wealthy and can afford to work without getting paid .
 so i can already see that being used as a tactic .
 combine that with a shutdown triggering either a lock down or reelection ,  and you really end up with the only ones losing out being those who are causing this shit .
 the minority party could easily abuse the shit out of that to force a reelection .
 that would be a very sweet point for military .
 the military isn &apos;t effected by the current shutdown .
 congress made a special budget appropriation for them last year that &apos;s good until this fall
 here in australia (where we have a similar rule as canada) that doesn &apos;t really happen very often because independent/third party candidates know that an election is not always winnable even for an incumbent .
 so we end up with strange situations like people promising to support the government against no confidence motions ,  but not supporting any of their actual policies .
 still though ,  we don &apos;t get government shutdowns every few years .
 yes ,  and the voters can then decide if that minor party has a point ,  and they gain votes ,  or are wasting time and resources ,  and lose votes .
 can a minority party cause a shutdown tho ?
 in australia (not that our government is a shining beacon) what happens is that they get 3 chances to pass supply and if it fails 3 times or three certain sets of circumstances occur ,  the entire government (so both parties) are scrapped and all positions are up for reelection again .
 at that point or your government shutdown for example ,  both sides are not doing their jobs effectively .
 thats kind of a big deal because your entire country is running without a government .
 why are they there in that case ?
 any aussie feel free to correct me ,  i &apos;m going off memory here .
 the fact that their logic is flawed aside ,  in those parliamentary systems you can theoretically vote out the prime minister in a snap election so it would be possible to vote out trump .
 doubt this will happen because one principle of american governance is a separate legislative and executive branch .
 those people are petty .
 millions are effected every single day this government is shutdown .
 i have dozens of friends and family that are without pay now for a looooong time .
 changes trump makes can be reversed ,  but peoples lives are being actually destroyed right now .
 to hear people think that way and its also a shame that its actually happening :(
 can the courts compel the treasury to spend money that wasn &apos;t appropriated by congress ?
 yes ,  it has been done quite recently in fact .
 united states ,  696 f .
 2012) ,  a group of federal judges sued the government for not giving them a cost-of-living increase ,  arguing that it violated the constitution &apos;s compensation clause .
  the court held that the failure to give the suing judges a raise did indeed violate the constitution and remanded to the claims court to determine the amount of back pay owed to the judges .
  the supreme court denied the government &apos;s petition for certiorari ,  and the treasury ultimately paid out the ordered back pay .
 lock them in a room together and feed them only taco bell until things are sorted .
  i don &apos;t imagine it would take long .
 the best answer is to make it so ,  when no new budget is passed ,  the government automatically continues at previous levels .
  this isn &apos;t ideal and there may be localized shortfalls or problems ,  but it &apos;s vastly superior to the shut down everything situation we have now .
 the default ,  when different arms of the government can &apos;t reach a compromise ,  should always be the status quo .
  the well-being of the government and the pay for people who work for it should never be a cudgel or bargaining chip to be used in negotiations .
 my proposed bill would go even further:   &apos;during any government shutdown ,  all members of both houses must be present ,  and in-chambers from 8 am to 5pm every business day ,  absent only with a written doctor &apos;s note disclosing in detail the urgent medical requirement excusing their absence .
  a punch clock will be used ,  and members must punch out for lunch ,  bathroom breaks ,  or any absence from the floor for any period of time ,  no matter how insignificant .
  if any member fails to accumulate 40 hours per week on said punch card during any week of any shutdown ,  said member waives his or her salary for the duration of his or her term ,  but not less than for one full calendar year .
 i think making them all sit in a room together all day ,  every day ,  would be great .
 exactly ,  to go further ,  send their teams home .
  let them do their own legwork and enforce (at the minimum) a monday through saturday ,  8 hours a day work week .
 he didn &apos;t even mention the even greater buy-a-bility of unpaid congressmen
 keep a similar open mind next time your state congress asks for a pay raise .
 here in arizona ,  you make less than minimum wage as a state rep .
 this means that you have to either be retired ,  or be independently wealthy enough to run .
 this is basically the same reason the president has a salary .
 washington was wealthy and wasn &apos;t going to take one because the office should be held by someone who isn &apos;t doing it for personal gain ,  but ironically that would just mean that only wealthy people would be able to afford to hold office ,  and influence the political direction of the country .
 this is why it &apos;s very important to always consider the possibility that you &apos;re wrong about things you think are obvious ,  and why when people use terms like  &apos;common sense &apos; ,  you should always doubt ,  or at least question ,  such statements .
  &apos;common sense &apos; is also always used by politicians when they &apos;re really saying  &apos;don &apos;t think about this much ,  and don &apos;t listen to what other people say about it .
 i was honestly afraid that that would be the case when posting it ,  but i was hoping that there would be good discussions and counterpoints .
 much like this reply .
 it provided some really good counterpoints that i wasn &apos;t thinking about as being a thing until now .
 this is the angle i &apos;ve been presenting since the start of this shutdown .
  it &apos;s easy in my conversations because i live in nyc ,  and i just mention rep ocasio-cortez and how she would be held hostage if this were to happen .
 i came here immediately about to post this answer .
 i just thought of the easiest way to be a jackass with this idea and this is the first conclusion i drew from it .
 quite a few people feel so disenfranchised that they will not vote for people to make their lives better ,  but vote to screw the people who have been making their lives worse .
 first thing: lobbyists are forever .
 if term limits are too short like what the senate republicans are proposing ,  you have an endless turnstile of house members every 4 years with limited experience ,  but lobbyists are forever ,  and will have an outsized influence .
 it &apos;s arguable that long term incumbents are similarly in the pocket of lobbyists though .
 a federal law enforcing term limits on congress would be the government telling the people who they can and can &apos;t send to represent themselves .
 states could individually put term limits on congress members ,  but in the current system it is limiting their influence/power as a state to do so .
 your congress members won &apos;t make it onto committees or gain favors if they are only in for a term or two and everyone knows it .
 it could also lead to /more/ corruption .
  &apos;hey you &apos;ve only got 2 more years left in politics anyway .
 why not vote for this bill that will benefit my company ?
 if you do you &apos;ll have a nice cushy job as vp of underwater basketweaving when you get out .
  &apos;  if they don &apos;t have fear of losing their next election that starts to look more tempting .
 still it could be done if states passed bills with term limits that only kick in once enough other states have done similar .
 they should do away with the shutdown mechanism entirely .
 this proposal wouldn’t work in a presidential system ,  where the president and legislature can be from different parties .
 it only really works in parliamentary systems where a party majority means you also get to control the government and executive .
 see  &apos;lobbying &apos; for what it is .
 if opposition day occured every month that would be a beautiful thing .
 a lot of other countries have something known as an opposition day ,  which means that the opposing party can do what they wish on that day .
 we move to impeach everyone who isn &apos;t us - and there is nothing you can do about it .
 dude i hate to tell you ,  but mcconnell once filibustered his own fucking bill .
 he is truly the worst person in our government .
 far worse than trump .
 can’t take their pay ,  because then potentially the president could “hold them hostage”
 if those gentleman can’t work 12 hour days to sort out a countries issues then they should resign .
 12 hours ,  6 days a week .
 same hours most military work when they’re deployed .
 seems fair to me .
 yeah there’s no way you’d ever convince the capitol police to lock all of congress in the capitol building 
 or the best idea ?
 as much as i am frustrated with all of the inner workings of government i still don’t want them to die in a fire .
 maybe then they &apos;ll come to an agreement faster .
 they could charge to view it and put the country into a surplus 
 don &apos;t even let them leave the building .
 lock it down ,  cater in some shitty food ,  and make them live there until it &apos;s resolved .
 +100 ,  gotta keep the senate in there too .
 i would prefer it were law that if a budget cannot be passed ,  the previous budget is passed .
  make it a cosntitutional amendment ,  or something else .
 there should not be any scenario where politicians can shut down the government over games of chicken .
  it &apos;s just inane .
 yes but he needs to veto it before they can over ride .
 man congress and the president suck .
 mcconnell has said that the president and the house need to work it out .
 this is a prime example of why all parties need to be subject to the same rules .
 if congress stays ,  so does the president .
 and no one is paid .
 and if you insist that tsa continues to work ,  you pay them .
 no one wants to entrust their security with someone who is not being appropriately compensated .
 all you tsa haters: guess someone forgot about 9/11 .
 this would be a problem ,  as only the most well-insulated ,  thick-walled candidates would be elected .
  people of high conductivity would have little if any representation .
 does president probst &apos;s responsibilities include voting a member or two off the island until a budget is passed ?
 if you ask me ,  that doesn &apos;t sound like a bad idea .
 teddy roosevelt is rolling over in his grave .
 i think the correct solution is: congress isn &apos;t allowed to leave d .
 until the shutdown is resolved .
 sit down and work until you figure out how to do your job
 these things aren’t as simple as they look
 it &apos;s the same reason the president gets a salary .
 washington didn &apos;t want to take it but accepted it to ensure that a poor man could become president in the future .
 yeah ,  and if we want a government that represents the people its a terrible idea .
  for example ,  take aoc ,  who couldn &apos;t afford to rent an apartment in dc prior to actually taking office .
  she has already been burning her life savings the last 3 months and entered office during a shutdown .
  if she and others like her didn &apos;t get paid during a shutdown they wouldn &apos;t be able to live much less do the amazing work we &apos;ve been seeing out of freshman congressmen and women these past few weeks .
 i mean license points
 the finnish model is the best .
 speed fines are a fixed percentage of the income .
 so if you make a lot of money ,  you get fined a lot .
 but its the same proportion of your income
 you’ll eventually get your license suspended .
 also criminal speeding .
 haha kids are so stupid 
 well ,  it seems like it &apos;s effective in other countries .
   i understand that the executive branch is separate in america ,  but i would assume that there is a way to make it work .
 the hardest part is always going to be adding this law ,  everyone is going to have a different way to go about it .
   also ,  i &apos;m pretty sure this would require an amendment to the us constitution ,  right ?
   election procedure and all that ?
 in australia ,  if the governing party can’t get a spending bill through both houses ,  a double dissolution is called (simplifying it a bit ,  but that’s basically it) and the whole parliament is dissolved and an election is called .
 wouldn’t it just be a continual vote of no confidence from both sides though ?
 what i heard ,  most countries does not automatically have a re-election ,  but rather has an automatical roll-over of the old budget .
 not strictly true ,  the uk is currently governed by a minority conservative government .
 they remain in power through a  &apos;confidence and supply &apos; arrangement with a minority party .
 couldn’t this be weaponized ?
 for example ,  if my party has a minority stake ,  i would have an incentive prevent a budget from passing to trigger another election in an attempt to increase my party’s seats .
 if they can &apos;t do their job their seat should immediately go up for election .
 you would def need some lows around electioneering .
 one of the best thing about the old canadian system ,  where we didn’t have standard terms and elections were triggered ,  was that there was only ever a number of weeks notice so you would get these short blasts of election adverts compared to the “basketball-like” us elections with 9+ months of drama that don’t matter and then everything goes crazy in the last moments .
 with such a rule in place ,  these bullshit games stop ,  or the people playing them are out .
 after a couple of elections ,  you shouldn &apos;t see an issue anymore .
 they really just need to make election day holidays .
 it should be the law that everyone has off on days where we get to vote .
 it &apos;s glaringly obvious how classicist it is to not free people from labor for election days .
 i &apos;m american ,  and neither do i .
 all i can do is vote and write to my congress people ,  unfortunately .
 i &apos;m an american ,  and it boils down to our corrupt and all too often immoral politicians .
 while our politicians like to point out corruption in other countries ,  it &apos;s really just one of the many things they do to distract from their own misdeeds .
 american politics 101= deflect ,  defer ,  deny and discredit .
 our president is an idiot but even he mastered this .
 oh man ,  just wait til you get a load of our 13th amendment !
 meanwhile ,  your mortgage is foreclosed so you lose all equity in your house ,  and your credit rating is trashed .
 if there were some definite point when they would start getting their money i would agree .
  but if the point where you start to get paid again is undetermined then it is the same as not getting paid as far as all of your bills and daily needs for a family are concerned .
  you don &apos;t even get the short-term benefits of unemployment like smaller expenses for gas ,  eating ,  daycare ,  etc .
 this is only partially true .
 the government has many subcontracted employees who are not eligible for back pay .
 this hits many low income employees very hard as it &apos;s often janitorial staff and similar who are subcontracted .
 there are many higher level subcontractors as well ,  and they may also be living paycheck to paycheck depending on their situation .
 they have been out of work and will never receive payment for this time .
 the problem is no working person should have to wait one minute extra for their paycheck regardless of how they live  .
 they couldn &apos;t be a minute late to work ,  why should they have to wait for their money .
 no we just fire the leader of the party whenever their approval ratings dip below a certain number or they have an extramarital affair and impregnate one of their staff (ok he was only deputy but c &apos;mon) .
 that &apos;s exactly what just happened with the brexit votes in the uk .
 not enough votes to pass may &apos;s brexit package ,  but all the tories and dup come together to maintain their coalition government .
 can &apos;t possibly allow another party or coalition to try to fix this mess .
 thing is we also have compulsory voting ,  so it &apos;s much harder for extremest or radical factions to hold seats .
 we end up with a relatively centrist government that ends up being quite boring (which is a good thing) .
 that &apos;s why stupid people want to  &apos;shake things up &apos; every few years .
 but overall ,  representing a large portion of the population means we &apos;re less likely to get a more fanatical and vocal minority holding power .
 having to make deals with other parties and independents is also more preferable than slapping on poison pills and riders to critical bills like they do now with budgets and disaster relief funding .
 it’s a weird group of uneducated former republicans who now hate trump .
 the shutdown has affected people in weird ways .
 friends of mine with savings are loving the free leave and are taking vacations because of the paid time off .
 those who aren’t are .
 well ,  considering other employment .
 white castle sliders and bathroom locked until things are sorted .
 shutdown over in minutes .
 but the bathrooms are being remodeled so they have to use the portajohns in the courtyard .
 i like your idea where the threat implied by not agreeing is that things won &apos;t change .
 however ,  that might be precisely what some people want ,  and could default to  &apos;if i don &apos;t get the changes i want ,  then we &apos;ll just leave things as they are ,  which i know you dislike more than i do &apos; .
 it &apos;s probably not as bad as shutting down ,  but it &apos;s not exactly good either .
 i mean ,  we lived through last year so it can &apos;t really be a bad thing .
 that &apos;s what we do here in the uk .
 it worked well enough here until our democratic system ate itself over unrelated issues .
 off hand i want to agree with you ,  but i &apos;d like to play devil &apos;s advocate for a moment .
 what if we were in a situation were an unpopular but very politically active party somehow won a large majority of congress and passed a very unpopular and ineffective budget .
 but when the next congress comes in and does not have enough votes to pass a new and better budget ,  the old one would be forced to carry forward .
 (basically: what would happen in this situation if last session &apos;s republican filled congress was competent ?
 maybe not waive salary - some people rely on it ,  while others are independently wealthy and could ignore that with impunity .
 i &apos;m thinking you should hit  &apos;em in the re-election eligibility .
  if they &apos;re not willing to do their job ,  they can &apos;t be elected into their jobs again .
 that &apos;s actually why congresspeople and the president have high salaries ,  so they won &apos;t be so easily bribable .
 not that it matters; having money just means you want bigger bribes ,  it doesn &apos;t eliminate your desire for more money .
 true ,  their normal price would drop during a shutdown .
 congressional discount days !
 we need to make it easier to serve and we need to pay people to do that .
 if we don &apos;t ,  then we only get people who don &apos;t need to work .
 relatedly ,  the same applies to legislative schedules .
 my city council is essentially unpaid and holds meetings in the middle of weekdays .
 with that schedule ,  only small business owners or people who don &apos;t work can serve .
 most people can &apos;t just randomly take a wednesday afternoon off .
 i’m an educated person .
 the other day someone asked me “if you’re running a race and you pass the person in second ,  what place are you in ?
 ” and without thinking i said “first ,  obviously” and went back to whatever i was doing .
 they had to correct me and point out how if i’d spent 1 second looking at the question i’d know the answer was obviously second place .
 that’s why it’s good to doubt common sense answers to a healthy degree at first .
 wish everyone ,  politicians included ,  did this more .
 this is the problem with much of society .
 i call it  &apos;first level thinking &apos; .
 we think about the primary effects of an action ,  but not the cascading consequences .
 this question is a great example ,  where the initial reaction is to think it is clearly a good idea .
 i think building a border wall is similar; at first ,  it seems like an obvious way to keep out illegal immigrants ,  but falls apart when you start looking into the reality .
 i don &apos;t think we need to require everyone to be able to reason out the complications ,  but we do need people to be able to understand that sometimes things are more complicated than they seem at first .
 heh i feel quite sheepish now as i have hastily judged both you and your question .
 yah i have seen it debated and another good one is lobbying dollars would probably still flow meaning the not wealthy ones might need to start accepting these  &apos;legal bribes &apos;
 it &apos;s basically the same reason you shouldn &apos;t trust politicians who brag about donating their salary to charity .
  ok ,  so you don &apos;t actually need a paycheck ?
  are you someone who can actually understand the plight of ordinary americans ?
  because you seem a bit insulated .
 pay them ,  but sequester them in washington until they come to a deal ?
 prevent them from flying home and back to congress during a shutdown .
 holy fucking shit .
 yeah i agree with the other guy .
 i &apos;ll just keep saying it .
 education education education .
 education reform for every single american .
 we are so willfully ignorant and uneducated .
 basic skills of active listening must be taught and we needed to start this many years ago in every community .
 we need parents teaching children ,  teachers teaching adults ,  whole communities banding together to protect education .
 without education reform our society will continue to collapse beyond repair into tribal sects of uninformed ignorant lazy humans .
 then you &apos;re not an idiot or you &apos;re not the right kind of idiot .
 4 years is a bit much .
 what about 20 year limits ?
 roughly a generation of representation which gets shifted as the next generation becomes the dominant voting force in a district .
 with that argument in mind .
 how do you justify the presidential limitation ?
  if a president has a high approval rate and majority like what they &apos;re doing .
  why should they only get two terms ?
 or are you of the belief the there should be no limits on that office either ?
 (note: serious question as it is something my group has argued in the past .
 you have to fund the government .
 how do you fund the government if the house/senate/president don &apos;t agree ?
 magically wave a wand ?
 i just get when and how politicians have been able to hold agencies and federal worker &apos;s hostage ?
 why isn &apos;t there laws to make it illegal ?
 mcconnell once filibustered his own fucking bill .
 i mean ,  councilwoman knope did the same thing .
 while also standing in roller skates .
 another good reason to not take their pay is because it creates an environment for biased decision making .
 the rich congresspeople will give zero shits and potentially force less wealthy congresspeople to give in to their demands .
  on the other hand ,  everyone only gets so much time ,  so forced sessions while in shutdown hurt everyone .
 can &apos;t take their real pay as they get most of their money from lobyiests .
 that small amount they get from their checks is nothing compared to what the lobiers pay them .
 limit them to the borders of the district of columbia ,  then .
 no going home and no pay until the government gets its collective shit together .
 alternatively we could go full gladiator and have it be how the next president is elected .
 535 people enter .
 1 leaves victorious .
 that number includes the senate ,  435 reps and 100 senators 
 belgium has kind of this .
 in the absence of a government that can pass a budget ,  the state is funded by ‘1/12sts’  every month is funded by one twelfths of the budget from last year .
 sign an emergency budget law .
 then make a no-confidence vote law in the house like uk has during shutdowns .
 i don &apos;t know why i hadn &apos;t thought of this myself .
  &apos;this is the default until we actively change it .
  &apos; how his this so very difficult ?
 i keep hearing how these people are intelligent .
 they aren &apos;t acting like it .
 i &apos;ve heard an argument against this .
 apparently some items in the budget are very specific and it would be wasteful to just keep the exact same one e .
 appropriations for r&d spending on projects that have subsequently been completed .
 not saying i endorse this
 that would result in whoever made the last budget being able to get enough in their side and saying  &apos;no ,  we don &apos;t want this budget ,  so we will just wait however long so you are forced to take our old one again &apos; thus not getting any budget reform ,  ever .
 no funding for the wall for trump ,  no funding for free college for sanders ,  and that right there would never end
 he’s gotta call for a vote and he won’t 
 he &apos;s hiding in his shell .
 honestly i &apos;m at the point where i hate mitch even more than the current dislike for the potus .
 he &apos;s the real one enabling the shutdown to continue because he won &apos;t do his job .
 any other nonpolitical occupation and you &apos;d get fired for not doing your job ,  right ?
 actually ,  if congress does not adjourn (and it sounds like they wouldn &apos;t be able to in this scenario) and the president does not sign or return the bill within ten days (excluding sundays) ,  then the bill becomes law as if he &apos;d signed it .
 it &apos;s in the constitution ,  article one i think .
 right ,  mitch mcconnell says he won &apos;t put any bill to a vote if the president won &apos;t sign it .
  this is obviously an excuse for his inaction ,  but even if it were genuine ,  the answer is obvious .
  pass the bill ,  let the president veto ,  override the veto .
 all you tsa haters: guess someone forgot about 9/11 .
 you can remember 9/11 and still see that the tsa is security theater and a jobs and contracting program to give political favors .
 and no one is paid .
 it really doesn &apos;t matter because almost all of them are super wealthy already .
 what we should do is introduce no-confidence votes where states can end these peoples careers in the middle of their term .
 this is a prime example of maybe there &apos;s more to other opinions than you &apos;re aware of .
 if your conclusion is that people who don &apos;t like the tsa must have forgot about 9/11 ,  that should be a big warning light going off that maybe you don &apos;t understand their viewpoint .
 kinda like how if you show up for a meeting and you &apos;re the only one there it should be an indicator you missed something along the way .
 the tsa is kabuki theater .
 they go through the motions so everyone feels safe ,  but they &apos;ve never caught anyone and all they really are is a nuisance .
 you dont get to leave the chambers .
 there &apos;s food brought in ,  access to restrooms and showers but no leaving the premise until a resolution is made .
 so after reading some comments amd thinking .
 i &apos;d like to add that the executive branch does not immediately get locked in as well unless they vetoed a budget before the shutdown .
 but once congress passes a budget if the president vetoes they are immediately placed in the chambers and locked in .
 edit2: removed the now showers and raising the temp idea .
 don &apos;t want things too rushed .
  &apos;holding government workers &apos; salaries hostage ?
 congratulations ,  you are now locked in and cannot leave .
 those nice national guardsmen around the compound whose pay you &apos;re withholding will keep you safe .
 not all states have points
 it &apos;s a model called day fines .
 your personal day fine is determined by your income ,  and courts will hit you with a certain number of them .
 for the same offense that gets you ten day fines ,  an unemployed person could pay 60 euro ,  while a super rich entrepreneur could pay six thousand .
 a considerable hit for both ,  but won &apos;t bankrupt either .
 would never pass in america because people making 25k would bitch that someone making 200k has to pay 8x as much as them .
 i wish we had percentage based fines
 i read a news story the other day that the ceo of nokia phones had to pay an approximately $100 , 000 speeding ticket .
 just hire a new chauffeur .
 but never put in writing that you told your driver to exceed the speed limit .
 it wouldn’t work in the us because it’s a duopoly .
 we’d need three or more real parties for it to work ,  which other countries have .
 it triggers re-election for _everybody_ .
 also budgets will generally always pass with a majority government .
 it’s only when you have a minority government + contentious budget does this come into play .
 no budget reached ?
 you’re all fired and we start over .
 if i’m remembering right the us used to have that as well .
 the shutdown issue as it is today is a relatively recent development .
 absolutely right - and hence they have a majority when it comes to the finance bill .
  of course the dup have recently threatened to vote down the finance bill so it is very topical .
 we live in interesting times !
 if people think the budget is fair or reasonable and you triggered an election for nothing ,  you could stand to lose seats .
 pressure is out on each party to be responsible for the actions they take .
 we &apos;ve had a minority government become a majority government after failing to agree on a budget (which was incredibly stupid at the time but that &apos;s another issue entirely) in a 3 party system .
 but if the sitting government can &apos;t pass a budget then their seats should be open for a smaller party to take if they win there .
 if the election is triggered ,  and the opposition gains ,  then that means the people are better represented as their views change 
 that &apos;s a double-edged sword .
 everybody ends up on the chopping block ,  including the minority party seats .
 what this doesn &apos;t solve is what to do during the election period .
 it definetly seems like a viable option to the hostage taking we &apos;re seeing now .
 30 years ago ,  a shutdown was ghastly ,  and everyone worked quickly to get it solved .
 now it &apos;s just another bargaining chip .
 this would curtail that behavior ,  i think .
 i &apos;m for it ,  too .
 you say that ,  but most people who are keeping the shutdown happening will be returned in 2-6 years .
 let’s not pretend most things politicians do have consequences .
 except the lobbyists aren &apos;t turned over .
 people forget that when they discuss stuff like term limits and such .
 the typical  &apos;focus on the corrupted ,  not the corrupter &apos; angle that americans are so replete to take .
 lobbyists have no term limits ,  can &apos;t be voted out of office .
 they have no accountability .
 any sort of fix that focuses entirely on the political side of the equation is unlikely to work .
 that &apos;s a thing ?
 only a short amount of time of political ads ?
 my concern would be republicans just using this to cut social services without having to vote for it ,  but i suppose as long as these cuts apply to the military too then republicans would still have some incentive to pass a budget .
 i learned how much money is spent on presidential campaigns the other day ,  it &apos;s pretty crazy .
 he was fired for hiring her as part of his staff while they were in a relationship .
 it &apos;s got wide reaching effects .
 i &apos;m a graduate student doing thesis research at nasa .
 i haven &apos;t been able to do any data collection this past month .
 some have had to post their homes for sale .
 some people don &apos;t even get to take vacations because they &apos;re still required to show up for work .
 nah then congressman shitpants would get everything he wants .
 there’d still need to be a majority for that to happen .
 and if the majority don’t want a change to the budget ,  then that’s what should happen anyway .
 that’s the whole point of democracy .
 for the second part of people holding out until they get the change they want there’d still be news of no budget which still won’t look good .
 it’s not a perfect solution but it’s a hell of a lot better than we have now .
 congress should be locked into the building and budget remains the same until they work something out .
 i think that’d be most fair .
 its what we used to do here in the states ,  until the 1980s when carters attorney general reinterpreted an existing law ,  and politicians started to use shutdowns as a political tool .
 further ,  their seat should be immediately up for re-election the week they fail to hit 40 hours .
 and they should be barred from running for any election ever again .
 it’s a good idea in theory but you’re right .
 just because you’re already rich doesn’t mean you couldn’t use another million dollars .
 fuck ,  you have to remember that it is also so people without money will actually run .
 if you were struggling to care for your family ,  you couldn &apos;t run for a position that didn &apos;t pay .
 in that case ,  only the rich would run .
 however ,  with a decent pay rate ,  it becomes a position that is actually an upgrade for most americans and worthwhile to pursue .
 aoc was a bartender and worked at a non-profit before she won ,  so she got a pay raise .
 and by instituting financial punishments ,  you &apos;d be hurting people like her .
 i think we &apos;re all pretty much programmed to think that way .
 she &apos;s either dumb ,  fearless ,  or knows it &apos;ll never take .
 and i say that as someone who really respects her attitude towards politics .
 i understand your points ,  but it &apos;s pretty true that all laws on paper are magical wand waving to fixes problems .
 one solution to funding the government is to just use the previous budget until a new budget is approved .
 i know this goes against the concept of gaap ,  but it &apos;ll at least obviate finding a way to pay federal employees without having to change more serious parts of our government .
 back in 2012 ,  while obama was president ,  he bluffed / taunted the democrats with a bill to allow the president to raise the debt ceiling without needing the approval of congress (which would avoid shutdowns entirely) ,  claiming that the democrats didn &apos;t have enough votes in their caucus to support such a measure .
 turns out the democrats did have enough votes to push it through ,  so he was forced to filibuster his own bill to prevent it from passing .
 that would do no good ,  they have homes here ,  and there is plenty to do .
 i live in dc ,  and unless i have to travel rarely have any need to leave .
 the problem with that is that with no pay some congresspeople can survive but some can’t ,  it would end up hurting the side trying to end the shutdown; in this instance especially because there’s a lot of new congresspeople who depend on the salary who are fighting to end the shutdown .
 that &apos;d be  &apos;twelfths &apos; .
 as a native english speaker ,  i thought it was  &apos;twelths &apos; ,  but my phone and google told me about that  &apos;f &apos; that comes out of nowhere !
 english is dumb .
 i &apos;d be okay with it if it were  &apos;twelvths &apos; but here we are
 i feel like the gop would use this method to underfund the government every year ,  seeing as inflation would make the previous year &apos;s budget not go as far .
 can &apos;t do the elections part .
 the terms of service for reps and senators are fixed in the constitution .
 they like it this way .
 they want consequences to keep the other party in check .
 on the flip side of that ,  those hundreds of thousands of federal employees wouldn &apos;t be screwed over while congress ,  senate ,  and the white house sort out their lives .
 and realistically ,  that money doesn &apos;t just burn and evaporate .
 it &apos;d be a lot cheaper than the damage currently being done to the economy by the shutdown .
 that waste would be offset ,  many times over ,  by the sheer economic cost of not having an operating ,  functional government ,  as we have right now .
 besides ,  that &apos;s easily avoided .
  you don &apos;t need to reinstate the entire budget - just specify the parts that are immune to renegotiation .
  tsa and irs being prime examples .
  it &apos;s very easy to do this .
 yeah ,  this is the guy who filibustered his own bill .
 i don &apos;t really trust him .
 this right here should be a red flag .
 the fact that one person has a right to decide if something even gets to be voted on is absurd .
 it’s essentially like having an extra president .
 he doesn &apos;t even have to do that !
 another senator can put a bill to the floor (it &apos;s unorthodox but can be done) but of course mitch can block it from moving forward .
 all mitch has to do is stay the fuck outta the way .
 it just happened this past thursday or friday ,  tim kaine introduced the house bill to the floor of the senate .
 but in two seconds mitch blocked it .
 howabout the airlines don &apos;t foist their security costs on the taxpayer ?
 lol this shut down is the first i &apos;ve heard praise towards the tsa .
 this is actually why it matters so much .
 all the independently wealthy congressman can wait it out and force the ones that do require the paycheck to cave .
 as long as the food is mediocre and the restroom cleaners don’t have to come into work unpaid .
 tack on the stipulation that they are not allowed to vote on any other bill besides ones that would reopen the government .
 also ,  there should be none of this not brining a bill to vote bullshit .
 if one chamber votes in favor of a bill ,  the other chamber must hold a vote on it .
 just like selecting a new pope
 100% this do your damn job .
 but after every certain number of days ,  make it so that the shower temps get slightly colder ,  restrooms have less flushing power ,  and food is brought in smaller portions .
 this is a great idea .
 too bad you have to get the guys who make the rules to agree to it .
 it &apos;s moved to a better location .
 like atlanta airport near the tsa line for example .
 where people can say shit to them while they  &apos;work &apos; 
 only if it includes the president & v .
 after all ,  congress passed a budget .
 the prez vetoed it .
 they could pass a veto-proof budget now ,  but mitch won &apos;t let anything come up for a vote .
 it &apos;s like punishing the entire class because of two bad kids .
 both of whom have way too much money to care .
 this is a terrible idea ,  voter suppression is hard work and takes years of planning .
 we can &apos;t just allow the electorate to go voting all willy nilly .
 then we would have government shutdowns every time the majority party thinks they could gain a few seats in an election .
 it &apos;d encourage even more government shutdowns .
 also ,  most states aren &apos;t really set up to have random voting days; there &apos;s no public voting holiday or anything ,  so you &apos;d get a tiny part of the electorate voting -- potentially even further encouraging the majority party to call elections on their minority colleagues .
 also ,   &apos;all seats contested &apos; is just generally not how our government works .
 in any case ,  good luck -- well ,  first off ,  good luck passing an amendment at all ,  given how hard that is ,  but also have fun convincing that many people to vote for something that would require lots of work from the people and fixes a problem that only comes up once a year .
 in other countries ,  failure to pass a budget results in either an immediate election of all officials ,  or the government continues to operate under the previous year &apos;s budget (or both !
 wait ,  isn’t dod still funded ?
 they’re probably still affected by the government shutdown ,  but as far as i know ,  the dod is fully functional and funded ,  which would include the national guard .
 also ,  wouldn’t this be considered a coup of sorts ?
 o_o as a canadian that sounds completely absurd
 why would someone with a low income care that someone making more money had to pay more money ?
 don &apos;t people want to pay less though ?
 wouldn &apos;t people making 25k be happy that they aren &apos;t paying as much ?
 for that kind of money ,  they could hire someone to speed for them
 the reason why a westminster system (e .
 ) escapes the duopoly is essentially because the rules around how elections operate ,  how parties are structured and how funding works means you don &apos;t need quite the same personally raised financial backing to campaign ,  and thus get elected .
 this in turn enables more minor parties (and more major ones if the right moves are made and conditions extant) ,  and more independent representatives .
 to escape the duopoly you correctly mention ,  the us would completely have to rip up what &apos;s in place and change everything wholesale .
 the sense i get is that people in the united states are firmly at a point of “party over principal .
 ” i could be completely wrong ,  but it feels like people are etched firmly into one party with no room to change their minds .
 you &apos;re assuming the general populace be knowledgable on the matters .
 the thing about that is voters in america aren’t informed
 you &apos;re missing the point .
 the minority party would use this for political gain ,  not that they &apos;ve reached some impass (border wall or not) .
 we have 2 parties in the states .
 here is exactly what would happen .
 a president is elected .
 the very next year the minority party refuses to pass a budget .
 people are upset with the current president and the minority party picks up seats .
 that system would be weaponized immediately .
 it would introduce additional gridlock and chaos into the us system .
 we don &apos;t have smaller parties though .
 at least in the uk there is a chance of a coalition shaking things up .
 eh ,  not necessarily .
 parties can have minds of their own and could always do something that the people don &apos;t want .
 so here &apos;s a realistic hypothetical: .
 41% of the senate refuses to pass a budget .
 an election is held .
 the minority gains 3 seats .
 what &apos;s stopping them from calling for another election ,  resulting in about a year of a non-functioning government while waiting months for new elections ?
 we keep running off the old budget .
 or the trigger fires three months before the budget expires .
 we have enough trouble tallying votes when we have a whole year to plan for it .
 if we had a sudden election ,  it would be a disaster .
 so not only do you now have financial issues ,  you have polling issues too .
 this says more about the state of our polling system than anything ,  but if we could make that process more efficient ,  perhaps a continuation of the current budget during the election period and the period during which a new budget is passed would work .
 40 years ago there were no shutdowns because a failure to pass a budget means no changes take place and the country runs on last year &apos;s budget until they sort it out .
 well adding an amendment to have congressional term limits and repealing citizens united would help .
 the issue is a lot of stuff gets through cause people don &apos;t vote but also forget promises of those elected .
 trump promised to  &apos;drain the swamp &apos; but none of that has happened and he actually added to it with billionaires and bankers .
 they just care until the votes are counted then it &apos;s over .
 i most european countries campaigning is only a month before hand .
 i know in ireland you have a week to clean all your election propaganda/signs or face heavy fines .
 correct me if i’m wrong other europeans
 last federal election &apos;s 78 day campaigns were the longest since the 1800s .
 that &apos;s exactly what would happen .
 resolutions for the military would be passed by both parties ,  and the gop would kill resolutions for social services ,  thus enacting mandated cuts .
 it &apos;s win-win for the gop .
 literally invented a 160k a year position for her
 sorry to hear that .
 i &apos;m faculty ,  and we have experiments that have ,  literally ,  rotted in usda ars greenhouses because our federal colleagues not only can &apos;t step foot on property ,  they can &apos;t allow us or our grad students to enter federal property either .
 months ,  and in one case years ,  of good ,  solid ,  experiments down the tubes .
 the carter administration thought zero-based budgeting would mean every expenditure would have to be justified every time so budget wouldn &apos;t balloon as they had been .
 too bad the government hasn &apos;t been doing this with any budget (esp the military) .
 let’s keep going along that line .
 make refusing to do the job you were elected for a federal crime ,  straight to prison .
 they all desperately need to learn that they work for us .
 too many for too long have made our government an aristocracy ,  wealthy lineages enriching themselves at the cost the people they purportedly serve ,  but in reality demand serve them .
 not only that ,  but the program seems to dictate that everyone who dares to think another way gets downvoted into oblivion .
 glad to surprised by a good ,  proper discussion in this thread .
 correction ,  it would avoid a certain kind of shutdown .
 i didn &apos;t know that was the story behind the  &apos;filibustered his own bill &apos; thing though ,  jesus h christ what a fucking scumbag 
 if you really want to hurt them ,  forbid them to dial donors while it &apos;s shut down
 i think they mean home as in their home districts or working on extracurricular activities elsewhere in the country .
 yeah ,  but it sounds a bit more workable than their current approach to underfunding the government .
 considering we would likely need a constitutional amendment anyways to implement a no-confidence vote ,  it wouldn &apos;t be that much more difficult to put in an exception .
 remember that time mcconnell shat on obama over the passage of a bill that obama vetoed ,  and mcconnell personally voted to override ?
 senate republicans could replace him with someone who &apos;ll bring a vote at any time .
 he just makes an easy scapegoat ,  although still a complicit asshole 
 except he can only behave that way with a majority of the senate’s approval .
   he’s not alone on this by a long shot .
 it &apos;s not one person since the senate chooses to have him be their majority leader
 why not simply let them clean their own restrooms ?
 make them eat school lunches and wait for designated bathroom breaks like the do with school kids .
 they could always feast on macdonald &apos;s
 i would like someone more knowledgeable than myself to explain why this is a terrible idea .
 i &apos;m sure it is ,  otherwise it &apos;s just too obvious not to be the case .
 i just can &apos;t think of the reason .
 everyone says how our government should be more like the catholic church .
 the president did not veto anything .
 senate verbal voted for a budget and ryan wouldn &apos;t let it come up for vote in the house .
 now the house passed a bill and the senate won &apos;t let that one come up for a vote .
 it &apos;s all because of a likely veto of course ,  but have some balls congress .
 make the president actually do it .
 because they think that eventually they will be the ones making the big bucks ,  and they don’t want to have to pay extra when they get there .
 remember ,  americans don’t think of themselves as poor ,  just temporarily down on their luck .
 obviously that isn’t true for everyone ,  but it’s a decent generalization .
 the same reason they were so upset about the estate tax that would never apply to them in a million years 
 that doesnt matter .
 all it matters is what i may one day have to pay once im super rich .
 because many americans are deranged ,  and think the answer to all life’s problems originated from your bootstraps .
 it’s not entirely their fault ,  we get fed a lot of pro-business/anti-worker propaganda .
  we don &apos;t have that to such a high degree in canada .
  there are some people who vote exclusively for their party ,  but many others who are voting specifically for the person running in their area or the party leader they like best ,  no matter what party that is .
  we also still have more than two parties to vote for .
 from what i know of the us ,  the ballets may as well not even have any names on them ,  just a big r or d to check .
 you have to hope your populace is not completely brain-dead ,  or else democracy fails ,  and no system will work .
 yeah ,   but isn &apos;t that also what every election does ?
 in fact ,  many voters are misinformed
 the minority party wouldn &apos;t be able to do so because the majority party can pass the budget without them .
 unless the government is dysfunctional ,  in which case the election should be triggered .
 a dysfunctional majority party which can &apos;t pass anything is no better than 2 parties at a stalemate .
 if states that mail every citizen a ballot and give them two weeks to send it in can &apos;t get turn out ,  i don &apos;t know what else could :/
 that also seems like a more viable option than our current government situation .
 shit &apos;s fucked ,  y &apos;all .
 let &apos;s just start over .
 but again ,  as someone else noted ,  lobbyists benefit just as much if not more from constant turnover ,  because the power of institutional memory shifts from long-time politicians to long-time lobbyists .
 this only spurs people to vote less ,  among other things (like ,  for example ,  how rather undemocratic our country tends to be) .
 what laws are there to limit their reach ?
 what forces can undermine them outside of legal wrangling ?
 that must be addressed in making changes to the political scene .
 term limits would weaken the house more than it already is .
 it’s the weakest of the branches and senate holds so much power now .
 term limits would lead to nothing happening because politicians can’t seem to pass legislation without term limits .
 and if a house member serves their term ,  then they’ll run for senate and have more control there all while bringing in someone to replace them in house to continue same agenda .
 voting power would diminish because the best candidates may be barred from serving due to term limits .
 nothing renders government more unstable than a frequent change of persons that administer it .
 - roger sherman ,  open letter 1788 .
 we’d end up with more inexperienced politicians who will spend 1/4 to 1/2 their terms figuring out how to work at the federal congressional level .
 this ,  too ,  weakens our power because we’d be stuck voting for those without experience due to forcing out the qualified candidates .
 another example ,  durbin and graham worked together last year on an immigration compromise .
 they’ve worked together and against one another for 23 years .
 with term limits ,  politicians may not build these relationships to compromise effectively .
 knowing your time is up on the job would also lead to less legislation .
 why worry about doing any work or you know you can’t run again for election ?
 they’ll focus on short term legislation that affects them now and leave the future debates to the freshmen .
 as stated before ,  this would automatically kick out good candidates .
 we could have candidates that push us in the correct progressive manner for society but the legislation they are working on won’t be voted on until after some have been forced out and replaced .
 this is bad for government and society .
 lobbying would skyrocket .
 a politician would be more willing to take cash for votes knowing time is limited before having to find another means of income afterwards (i’m sure most would be fine but ,  again ,  our politicians already only think about short term gains) .
 novice lawmakers would be more prone to take special interest money .
 i wish i had access to entire report but a report titled reexamining the institutional effects of term limits in u .
 state legislatures from 2011 looked at a variety of studies and found that many of the issues of corruption would not be curtailed as we think ,  but be exacerbated .
 this would lead to more corruption ,  according to the studies from the report .
 tl;dr: we don’t need term limits .
 term limits would weaken our government and our voting power .
 we had more corruption and less legislation .
 we need qualified politicians that will do what’s best for all of society ,  not just for a handful of lobbyist overseers .
 and that’s where the real difficulty arises .
 until we get our education system on track and shut out the bullshit spun up stories on both sides ,  a good chunk of the populace will continue to vote against their own interests .
 i would think democrats would be smart enough not to let the gop pass military spending without domestic spending ,  but then we &apos;d get the inane gop talking points about democrats not supporting the troops .
 maybe if there was a tax increase mechanism paired with the spending cuts ,  that could bring both parties to the table .
 is that dude single ?

 donor meets with family  family meets with congressperson .
 ban family from meeting anyone (because if you banned the family from meeting the donor ,  the donor would just find another middleman) .
 then you &apos;d have to lock family in their house .
 boom ,  massive police resources making sure these families are safe and can &apos;t be used as bargaining chips .
 all of this during a government shutdown .
 also ,  they &apos;ll be locked in their houses while congresspeople aren &apos;t .
 bonus: move family outside of dc ,  forbid them from calling congressperson ?
 nevermind that that &apos;s actual kidnapping ,  where are the families going to be kept in ?
 government houses during a government shutdown means more resources spent by an entity that can &apos;t spend resources .
 their own out-of-dc property ?
 what about congresspeople that can &apos;t afford property like that ?
 then cycle back into why we can &apos;t have congresspeople without pay during a shutdown .
 preventing a representative from going to their district seems extremely idiotic .
 they are elected to serve their constituents ,  if anything i would prefer reps to reach out more .
 remember that time mitch mcconnell refused to allow the obama administration to make public information about russian interference in the election ?
 hey ,  service members clean their own bathrooms and they don’t get to go home either .
 lead by example ,  congress 
 if college has taught me anything it &apos;s that those bathrooms would never get cleaned .
 doesn &apos;t it make more sense for them to focus on whatever issue caused the shut down ?
 when the government is shut down do we really want them cleaning bathrooms and shit when they should be doing their actual job ?
 oceanbluesomething for president 2020 .
 give em mres like the troops 
 they also have to be shepherded and talked down to by middle aged teachers .
 naptime is mandatory ,  but no recess .
 served only plain porridge (made with water) or plain hominy grits for the duration .
 in general ,  we have this policy in place so that we don &apos;t have a form of legislative filibustering where politicians that don &apos;t like a bill can &apos;t flood the floor with other bills to prevent the other bill from being added to the agenda .
 so ,  the senate leader controls the schedule .
 in this case it might make sense to allow the house to act as the gatekeeper instead of the senate leader ,  but that &apos;s not the way senate policy works ,  so there would have to be voting reforms based on it which is something that is generally frowned upon and not desirable to normalize .
 for instance ,  the senate during the previous presidency cycle voted to remove the 60 vote threshold to get judges brought to the bench which in turn gave mcconnell the excuse he needed to do the same for the sc judges during this presidency .
 it actually isn &apos;t a bad idea .
 the problem is that under the current rules in both chambers of congress ,  they simply don &apos;t have to .
 the problem is that they each set their own rules ,  which can be changed at any time (because fuck you ,  that &apos;s why) .
 also ,  let &apos;s not forget that in december both chambers passed a law that the president vetoed .
 in this case ,  the problem is not entirely on congress .
 (though the turtle that runs the senate has already said he won &apos;t pass the same bill again ,  because again ,  fuck you)
 one possibility would be attempting to squash passing/work on other bills by having one chamber simply pass a ton of bills .
  if there was a time requirement that must be met ,  it could be a double-edged sword - sure you force a vote ,  but perhaps not enough time would have elapse that would ensure proper vetting by the members of the other house ,  which could let bills get voted on prematurely .
  just two ideas i had .
 to answer the second one first: it would cripple congress even further .
 its extremely hard to pass anything through the senate ,  hell its hard enough just getting a bill voted on .
 you could have a house of reps controlled by one party flood the senate with bills that have no hope of passing .
 and what happens if the senate are in the middle of yet another one of their pathetic filibusters ?
 all you need to do is waste time until something passes the house of reps and suddenly that bill is gone and we have to wait for the senate to vote on this new bill .
 to address the first point: giving special status to the budget during a shutdown has merit ,  but its potentially dangerous as lazy politicians would vote in favor just to get the fuck out of there .
 i feel it would be better to pass a law preventing shutdown in the first place .
 if the government cannot pass a budget ,  the previous budget remains in place this would need several rule changes to the format of the budget but in the long run it would be worth it .
 it would mean everything continues to function as normal and entices both parties to negotiate in good faith instead of using essential services as leverage .
 but then we’d actually have to help poor people or something 
 iirc ,  weren &apos;t they hoping to pass a law to keep the coast guard paid ?
 phrased another way ,  the poors are  &apos;temporarily embarrassed millionaires &apos; or something like that .
 they actually do make that available since it’s such a normal thing ,  and it’s painfully sad that people allow the divide to be so easy to establish .
 we can keep treating the education budget as discretionary spending and funding it with the lottery .
 i couldn’t see the “re-election” clause thing working in america at all .
 yeah but if there is also a minority sitting president (let &apos;s say d-president r-congress) then theoretically the president could veto a budget if they thought it might lead to seats gained .
  it &apos;s unlikely ,  but possibly .
  plus you really don &apos;t want spontaneous elections ,  the only people who would be able to raise election funds on short notice would predominantly be owned be corporations .
  at least that &apos;s how i guess it would go in the american political system .
 uk has a coalition government .
 this wouldnt work in a two party system .
 there &apos;s so many blackout programs under the military budget that don &apos;t get approved ,  that when budget cuts do happen ,  it &apos;s affecting the troops .
 my brother &apos;s unit over in s .
 all got respiratory infections from the mold in the barracks because no one apparently could order some de-humidifiers on freaking amazon to help out .
 i mean ,  160k a year is no laughing matter ,  but if you get a look at the guy ,  and imagine what he would be expecting for his money ,  it would be a rough decision 
 nah just keep allowing family to dial .
  only the elected officials are prohibited during the shutdown .
  that &apos;s 30 hours a week of work (dialing donors) they aren &apos;t doing ,  and if their family tries to pick up some of that slack it &apos;s still less effective to get a call from their family than from them .
 member that time obama was supposed to appoint a supreme court justice and mitch obstructed .
 that &apos;s a job for the lower populace ,  not for high class people living in luxery !
 and the restrooms are simply two porta-potties set up in the corner of the house/senate .
 this guy bathrooms .
 if college has taught me anything it &apos;s that i &apos;ll never be able to repay my student loans .
 in this instance i think it would be alright to let them either dig into their own pockets to pay for staff to clean it or they do it themselves .
 they put a lot of americans into deep shit financially .
 they can feel that in the literal sense as a repercussion .
 are they so far removed from humanity ,  that they don &apos;t know how to clean a fucking toilet ?
 it takes like 30 seconds ,  top .
 every day ,  people work and also clean their own toilets .
 if they &apos;re already cleaning up shit ,  a little more won &apos;t hurt
 enough of those ,  and you won &apos;t need to clean the toilets for a month .
 no man ,  make them eat nutriloaf like prisoners in solitary .
 also ,  yearly standardized tests on the issues presented in bills ,  meaning they will actually have to read the bill
 if overloading is a concern ,  then make something like a 2 passed vote a week maximum & minimum (if a passed vote queue from one chamber to the other exists)  .
 requirement to vote on the passed bill dies after 2 weeks in the queue .
 holding up a vote because one is afraid of the fallout of holding politicians accountable for their vote is asinine .
 1) last years budget auto-renews if we can &apos;t agree on a new budget .
 2) if one chamber passes a bill ,  the other must vote on it as stipulated above .
 i like figuratively locking them in d .
 as a possible alternative to 1 .
 so there would have to be voting reforms based on it which is something that is generally frowned upon and not desirable to normalize .
 if it &apos;s happening now anyway ,  perhaps it should be normalized so that the key question is the legitimacy of the policy change being enacted rather than the fact that the policy change is occurring at all .
 i may be wrong in my recollection but it wasn’t even vetoed .
 the president said he would so paul ryan just opted not to send it .
 there were enough votes that the veto could have been overridden ,  but ryan was retiring and didn’t want to deal that kind of political defeat to the president .
 afaik the house has passed multiple bills to open portions of the govt .
 they haven &apos;t been taken up in the senate though
 the uk &apos;s coalition government ended in 2015 .
 then it was just tories .
 then may called another ge and lost seats ,  and is now propped up by (but not in coalition with) the northern irish dup .
 not a coalition ,  .
 it &apos;s known as confidence and supply .
 dup will back tory members on key votes but as brexit shows not on issues it strongly disagrees with
 we haven’t had a coalition since 2015 .
 coalition governments are extremely rare .
 has only had 6 in history ,  two of which were war cabinets .
 well that’s just entirely mismanagement .
 the money was there because the medical care cost far more than the cost to fix the problem .
 sure ,  that’s a difficult problem to solve ,  but the problem isn’t budget cuts; the problem is that money didn’t get allocated to prevent the need to spend more money 
 and if their family tries to pick up some of that slack it &apos;s still less effective to get a call from their family than from them .
 so nothing changes ?
 because it &apos;s not going to be too much of a hassle .
 just have the donor set up a list of instructions ,  it &apos;s not like much can be done in the donor &apos;s favour during a shutdown anyways .
 unless they are benefitting from the shutdown itself in which case the instructions would be  &apos;keep doing what you &apos;re doing &apos; .
 this idea is sounding better and better .
 ever since that guy pointed out your inconsistent spacing between h and t the other day i have been noticing your handle a lot .
 they can resign if they can leave the room .
 they &apos;d just use our tax money to create a federal contract and then invest  &apos;personal &apos; funds into their buddy &apos;s private janitorial company .
 as long as i can still taxidermy my body when i &apos;m dead ,  they can have my organs .
 you know exactly how reddit feels about that shit
 my organs are free for all if anyone needs them .
 it &apos;s interesting ,  because this is actually very similar to their state church system .
 icelanders are automatically registered as a member of their mother &apos;s church upon birth and have to opt out if they don &apos;t want to be registered as a church member .
 my icelandic friends and i call it  &apos;christian by default &apos; .
 leads to a lot of interesting cultural and religious views of what it means to be religious or not .
  most people don &apos;t unregister ,  but just never go to church .
 and the churches registered with the government still receive money from the state for anyone registered as congregants/members .
 churches receive roughly $7 .
 00 per month per registered individual - regardless if they regularly attend or not .
 only in recent years have people started to actually bother unregistering from their churches .
 as long as the ability to opt out is easy and evident ,  i don &apos;t care .
 thanks for the upvotes everyone !
 i really did not expect my opinion to be appreciated by so many people .
 i did read most of the comments and responded to some .
 it seems a lots of people can &apos;t think of a reason to opt out .
 the only answer i have to that is everyone has their own view on life and may have different views then the majority .
 just out of curiosity ,  what would this mean in a jane/john doe type situation ?
 there seems to be this weird stigma that people have where they think that if they are an organ donor and the er folks see that when trying to save their life ,  that for whatever reason they &apos;ll half-ass it so they can get their organs .
  i &apos;ve never understood it ,  but this seems like a good way to handle that .
  let people choose not to be helpful postmortem instead of them having to choose to be .
 i &apos;ve always said that this should be the way .
 i got an extra 13 years with my dad thanks to someone else &apos;s heart .
 edit  i &apos;m going to do my best to get back to every responder to this comment .
 it &apos;s almost exactly a year to the day that my dad died ,  and you &apos;ve (mostly) all made me tear up with your comments and stories .
 #if you want to be an organ donor ,  make sure your family knows about it now .
 i don’t know ,  my heart’s just not in it .
 on a serious note ,  it’s a great idea .
 if you care enough to not be an organ donor ,  you can just opt out .
 this just encreases the pool by adding the folk who don &apos;t care .
 i do believe there should be a clause added for those who could not reasonably be asked to give consent in the first place .
 how do i feel about (extremely popular opinion) ?
 oh reddit ,  you never change .
 not even the wording  .
 how do you feel about this ?
 we &apos;ve had this in wales since 2015 .
 i can &apos;t remember anyone disagreeing with it .
 i once went to a service ontario here in canada and the person in front of me opted out to be an organ donor .
 the service lady at the desk was pretty loud when saying “ok sir ,  you are no longer an organ donor .
 ” everyone stared .
 this could be seen as publicly shaming the man .
 reminder to sort by  &apos;controversial &apos; for the interesting discussions
 i &apos;d opt out immediately .
 just not comfortable with the idea .
 don &apos;t take my choice away from me .
 i have a question for everyone who upvoted and commented on this .
 how many of you are organ donors ?
 i &apos;m in portugal ,  we already do this ,  it has never been an issue as far as i recall
 it &apos;s the same in the netherlands .
 it &apos;s a good thing- people can opt out ,  and also ,  the relatives of a deceased person can still decide to opt out if they want to .
 many people aren &apos;t against this ,  but don &apos;t really want to think about it or make an effort while alive ,  and organs are needed hard !
 when my brother killed himself the hospital was incredibly pushy and pressured my grieving mother to let them harvest him .
 they took away our chance to say goodbye ,  and they botched the procedure and ruined all of his organs by not putting him on a ventilator .
 then they billed us $30 , 000 for butchering him and refused to budge on the bill .
 we still can &apos;t even collect his estate because of the hospital bills from them cutting him apart against his wishes .
 he was dead before he ever arrived and they still found a way to charge us for a surgery .
 its not ridiculous to think those people would let you die for your organs .
 they absolutely fucking will .
 i &apos;ve seen the way they get when they think they have someone they can use .
 i don &apos;t doubt for a second that they would have pushed us to pull the plug if he was on life support .
 don &apos;t have so much faith in these people .
 they &apos;re highly paid and see you as a profit center .
 they only care about how much they can bill your insurance company .
 fuck st mary &apos;s hospital in west palm beach florida .
 i &apos;m from austria and it &apos;s been like this over here for as long as i can remember .
 honestly ,  there is no issue .
 very few people actively don &apos;t want to be donors .
 they care enough to just opt out .
 most people don &apos;t care whether or not their organs are donated/don &apos;t think about it and would be too lazy to opt in if it weren &apos;t automatic .
 i literally see no reason against it and anyone i &apos;ve ever talked to about our system has expressed the same opinion .
 it &apos;s beyond me why it &apos;s not a thing in more countries .
 til it &apos;s more widespread than i thought .
 i hope it &apos;s going to become even more common !
 i &apos;m not a fan of having to opt out of something you didn &apos;t sign up for in the first place .
 the onus shouldn &apos;t be on the non-consenting party .
 i am an organ donor myself ,  and encourage everyone to be organ donors .
 however ,  i know that many people and their families have personal reasons for not wanting to be donors .
 despite the ability to opt out ,  there will still be cases of people who didn &apos;t get around to opting out or maybe weren &apos;t even aware that they are compulsory donors .
 also ,  if people with mental illnesses or cognitive disabilities aren &apos;t automatically opted out ,  this raises many ethical issues .
 not a fan; it violates the idea of free choice over ones body .
 how can the logic of  &apos;my body my choice &apos; be applied to abortion but not to your own bodily organs ?
 if i’m dead i don’t need my organs .
 i have to disagree .
  while morally i think it is great to have organs more readily available ,  i think you should not automatically be opted in .
 my feelings on this stem from the technology industry .
 apps ,  windows (microsoft) ,  browsers ,  video games ,  they all automatically opt you in to their information gathering ,  email sending ,  text message viewing ,  invasive  &apos;services &apos; .
 i personally think it should be illegal to have anyone automatically opt me in for anything .
  everything should be a default no until i otherwise give my consent to it .
 it also should be illegal to give out other people &apos;s information under the guise of  &apos;if you recommend 5 friends ,  you get a free t-shirt &apos; .
  because then all the sudden i am getting spam calls from gyms ,  window companies ,  scammers ,  all because some asshole that has my number decided to put me down as a recommendation .
  even asking to take me off lists ,  i still get calls .
 yes i am an organ donor .
  yes i wish more people were .
  but no ,  i don &apos;t beleive anyone should be automatically opted in for anything .
 no one should have to spend time ,  energy ,  or have to navigate tricky menus just to opt out of something they never agreed to in the first place .
  even if it is a simple 5 minutes of your time with an easy to navigate website .
  most companies/places bank on people not paying attention/not knowing in the first place .
 i don &apos;t really care but i do have a funny story .
 when i was 16 i was with my dad getting my driver &apos;s license .
 the lady asked me  &apos;do you want to be an organ donor ?
  &apos; i looked at my dad ,  horrified ,  and said  &apos;when does that operation take place ?
 unpopular opinion but: i do not like it .
 i am all for organs going to those that need it ,  and i would hate for organs to decompose and go to waste .
 but i am very much against the notion that you are automatically subscribed to becoming an organ donor ,  this would suggest they would have an automatic claim over your body unless you opt out .
 i principally believe that they do not and should not have any claim to my organs and body unless i willingly opt myself in .
 i think it’s great to have more donors and i’ll get hated for this but ,  i want to be complete when i’m buried .
 please respect my selfish wish .
 we’ve had this in wales (part of uk) for a few years now .
 i don’t know ,  what if there was a law where all your possessions went automatically to the state upon your death unless you specifically opted out and said it goes to your spouse and kids .
 such systems may lack accessibility for many people ,  and others may not even know about the fact they are automatically opted in .
 it also seems to reduce the medical idea of body autonomy ,  so for these reasons i’d say no
 while it is a good idea for saving lives ,  i feel like the government automatically opting in is kind of an overreach of powers .
 i &apos;m with sean lock on organ donation .
 go for it as long as all my organs go to the same person ,  so it is less of a donation and more of a hostile takeover .
 i want to be stuffed and mounted next to a giant beaver .
 i registered at registerme .
 org as part of a demonstration at a donate life rally (organ drive ,  hehehe) in college ,  and opted to exclude my skin “so my loved ones can have me stuffed and mounted in their home” .
 the crowd appreciated it .
 i never went back to change it .
 how do you plan on preforming the taxidermy if you are dead ?
 hijacking the top comment for an explanation of the logic behind this: .
 if you have an opt out vs .
 opt in system of organ donation ,  way more people donate at least in part because you have to deregister .
 i believe germany does this as well and it massively increased their rates of organ donation .
 personally i am fine with this ,  i’m an organ donor already - but i had to opt in .
 there are far less people who do it voluntarily 
 op has just made a post for the sole purpose of farming karma .
 how do you feel about this ?
 these  &apos;how do you feel &apos; questions about popular opinions need to be banned 
 getting really tired of these  &apos;reddit ,  how would you feel about x scenario that has been vehemently supported/opposed on this site since its inception ?
 i can’t believe that i had to come down to the seventh post to find someone calling this out .
 my favorite meta post was “reddit ,  how do you feel about instituting a rule against askreddit questions asking if they should institute really popular ideas ?
 reddit how do you feel about science ,  keanu reeves ,  false rape accusations being bad ,  vaccinations being good ,  mlms being bad ,  etc .
 how the fuck do people still upvote shit like this ?
 one day the mods will ban this type of post ,  absolute trite .
 8k upvotes ,  holy shit .
 other controversial reddit topics include  &apos;how would you feel if vaccines were mandatory ?
  &apos; ,   &apos;should the us provide national healthcare ?
  &apos; and  &apos;what do you think about donald trump ?
 99% of people will agree and they know  shitty ass post .
 man this site sucks ass .
 idk why i &apos;m still here lol  .
 alright ,  please lie down over there .
 mind if i use your anus for a few minutes ?
 what’s your opinion on motel bathtubs 
 u me gas station cooler of ice ill get it done
 dibs on your liver ,  i &apos;ve been riding mine hard and putting it up wet .
 so ,  um ,  can we have your liver ?
 churches receive roughly $7 .
 00 per month per registered individual .
 they receive that money from the government ?
 not true anymore .
 this was abolished about 7 years ago ,  which has led to a very consistent annual drop in church memberships .
 the parish fee is still a thing though ,  and you pay it if even if you &apos;re not part of a church or religious organization .
 this we call the atheist tax .
 it has been ruled a human rights violation by the european human rights court ,  but we collect it anyway because fuck me ,  i guess .
 i feel like that &apos;s the mindset of most people .
 they just don &apos;t care ,  so might as well do something useful .
 it &apos;s super easy .
 you do it online .
 i just tried it ,  and after signing into the site with two-factor id ,  it was literally 4 clicks .
 (i didn &apos;t actually register as a non-donor ,  just checked how it &apos;s done) 
 maybe i &apos;m a moron but why would someone opt out ?
 i &apos;m not looking forward to donating one day but why not keep someone else alive if possible ?
 i have no idea ,  but i would assume that taking organs from someone with no medical history could be risky .
 i don &apos;t think most of their organs would be very good after the time it takes to do an investigation .
 yes its a bs argument to say that doctors will let you die to harvest organs ,  but wouldn &apos;t let the transplant candidates die for their organs .
 there seems to be this weird stigma that people have where they think that if they are an organ donor and the er folks see that when trying to save their life ,  that for whatever reason they &apos;ll half-ass it so they can get their organs .
 some version of this seems like a semi-regular plot on doctor tv shows .
  there &apos;s a guy brain dead from a motorcycle crash and the doctors are trying to convince his grieving wife to take him off life support and give up his kidney in time to save a sick kid ,  that kind of thing .
 my mom had no will or anything when she died last year so we had to make the organ donating decision (we did ,  and her liver was a match for a 53 year old man .
 i hope he &apos;s recovering well .
 ) the lady who came to talk to us said that that mentality doesn &apos;t make sense ,  because they need the organs to be healthy to donate ,  and they want to be able to use as many as possible if you &apos;re a donor so it doesn &apos;t make sense that medical professionals would take worse care of you if they know you &apos;re a donor .
 it always blows my mind when people believe this .
  take it from a former emergency department nurse ,  we do not have the fucking time to figure out who is and who isn &apos;t an organ donor when people are crashing .
  even if we did ,  we do our best to save everyone who isn &apos;t a dnr .
  most donations come out of the icu and the organ donor organizations have contact with the family .
 that &apos;s at least understandable fear ,  however illogical .
 beats situation we have in poland ,  where it &apos;s in next of kin discretion to allow organ harvest ,  and there &apos;s absolutely no way to legally force them to do so .
 i &apos;ve personally seen denial based purely on (unfounded !
 ) fear that organ harvesting will somehow make body look bad in open-casket burial ceremony .
  &apos;heartless man saves dad &apos;s life &apos;
 got and extra 5 with my grandpa thanks to a kidney donor
 when my fiancee passed away suddely a couple years ago ,  i found it oddly comforting to know his bone marrow and retinas moved along to someone else .
 so far i &apos;m going on a year with my mil ,  and i &apos;m expecting many more .
 i love her as much as my own mother ,  and don &apos;t know what i would do without her .
 my sister did not have a will when she died suddenly in her 30s .
 our entire family was able to confidently say  &apos;yes ,  she wanted her organs donated .
  &apos; we found out later her liver saved one man who wrote my family a letter a year after the transplant .
 we then asked and were told her skin ,  corneas ,  other organs ,  were used to help more than 2 dozen people total .
 it was actually comforting to know a piece of her was still out there and helping others .
 in singapore it works this way ,  but with the added factor that if you opt out then your name will be on the bottom of the waitlist should you ever require a donation .
 when we lost my dad ,  6 lives were saved .
 one of which was a 30 something y/o man with his heart ,  delivered on valentine’s day ,  
 someone else &apos;s kidney bought my favorite uncle a few more years ,  as well .
 i always had no problems giving up my 8 essential organs to save the lives of others .
 i have a problem that they also harvest my tissue ,  bone skin and eyes for profit .
 i wish there was a way i could only opt in for life essential organs 
 just a gut &apos;s feeling .
 i too think it &apos;s a great idea .
 i &apos;m gonna be dead ,  don &apos;t care what happens to my organs at that point .
 i have to go out on a limb here and say great idea ,  think all countries should follow suit !
 when i die ,  i &apos;m seriously thinking of going the  &apos;donate my body to science &apos; route .
 would be comforting to think i &apos;m being of some use .
 and if my family wants a part to cremate or bury ,  they can have foot or something .
 til encrease is an obsolete spelling of increase
 plus ,  at least as far as entire countries go ,  it &apos;s still a pretty small gene pool--i met a guy from there who told me that he literally has to make sure someone isn &apos;t related to him in some way before they start dating .
 i &apos;m certainly no expert ,  but wouldn &apos;t those same conditions also increase the likelihood of a successful transplant between two native icelanders ,  even if the donor is some rando ?
 reddit ,  how do you feel about world peace ?
 i’m welsh and i had totally forgotten this !
 thanks for the reminder !
 there are a lot of countries in the world with this policy but reddit always makes a fuss when some country announces it like it &apos;s some groundbreaking thing .
 yep ,  fellow welsh here and i agreed with it and am happy they did it
 first of all ,  that law won &apos;t come into effect until summer 2020 .
 secondly ,  relatives do not have the option to opt out ,  unless they can make a plausible argument that the deceased would not have wanted to donate their organs .
 which is a hard case to make if the deceased never bothered to register their wishes .
 i’m sorry to hear that .
 it is ridiculous that they dare charge you surgery fee .
 a lot of people are worried that the doctors would harvest your body before you actually die ,  but never thought that the hospital would charge you and profit from the whole thing .
 this can’t be legal ,  you should talk to a lawyer about this .
 i’m glad i’m not alone in feeling this way .
 if you want to encourage good behavior ,  you add an incentive ,  not bureaucracy .
 i get how it’s “easy to opt out” ,  but i shouldn’t have to fill out a form (at all) ,  even if it is a check box and a submit button ,  just so people don’t take my stuff .
 i think it’s incredibly noble and selfless to make an anatomical gift .
 i think it’s shitty to make that decision for someone else by default .
 can’t believe i had to scroll this far down to find someone who mildly disagrees
 i &apos;m not a fan of having to opt out of something you didn &apos;t sign up for in the first place .
 the onus shouldn &apos;t be on the non-consenting party .
 this right here .
 another point to consider with relation to this is who has ultimate control over one &apos;s organs ,  the individual or the state .
 with an opt-in model ,  the individual retains inalienable property rights to their person ,  whereas in the default participation model ,  technically the organs are property of the state .
 this isn &apos;t some orwellian fear of big-brother coming to harvest your organs at the gov &apos;t choice ,  but rather it &apos;s a case of fundamental rights; either we are agents of our own being ,  or we &apos;re agents for the collective .
 perhaps it &apos;s my own ignorance that keeps me from seeing a melding of the two ,  however i just don &apos;t see a reasonable compromise here that doesn &apos;t affect personal rights elsewhere .
 i say this as an organ donor myself too .
 personally ,  instead of a gov &apos;t mandate for organ donor participation ,  we should instead encourage people through social channels to opt into organ donation programs; let them decide for themselves instead of taking away their ability to consent to what happens to their body (sounds awfully similar to the abortion argument .
 imho ,  people are more apt to do what &apos;s right and helpful to society without gov &apos;t intervening .
 the permission should be given ,  not retracted .
 i am totally on board with you .
 self-determination of what happens to one &apos;s body seems to be a core human right .
 do i want everyone to be an organ donor ?
 do i want everyone to be forced to be an organ donor ?
 if more than 50% of your body is transplanted into someone else ,  you &apos;ll absorb their consciousness into your own and take over the new body .
 here i go down a blackhole watching sean lock compilations for the next few hours .
 love sean lock though   .
 anyone remember the whole carrot in a box incident of 2015 
 thanks ,  i just had it stuffed .
 i want to be stuffed and given a lion head .
 talking about giant stuffed beavers .
 your mom says hi .
 how do you think he died
 you know exactly how reddit feels about that shit
 i don’t mind as long as the downvote process isn’t that hard .
 i just want to clarify that i didn’t actually downvote ,  but  want the option to be easy for those who wish to .
 how do you feel about clean water being provided to everyone free of charge ?
  &apos;unpopular opinion : kittens are cute &apos;   .
 these fuckers can rot in hell :p
 i saved a puppy from drowning ,  was i in the wrong ?
 redditors of reddit ,  how would you feel about politicians no longer being corrupt ,  the north korean government shutting down and a cure for cancer ?
 reddit ,  how would you feel about a law banning things that are bad ?
 sort by controversial to join the real discussion .
  &apos;find the comments that say they don &apos;t like it .
 reddit ,  how would you feel if circumcision was banned ?
 reddit how do you feel about trump ?
 sprints away laughing manically
 brace for upvotes
 that &apos;s a surprisingly specific and accurate list of things reddit circlejerks about
 because most people give 0 shits about keeping subs true to their purpose .
 they just upvote stuff that makes them feel good or they agree and downvote stuff that doesn’t make them feel good or they don’t agree with .
 it validates their opinion and a lot of the people upvoting don &apos;t actually understand how reddit and this subreddit is suppposed to function .
 i think this gained traction in 2016 and ever since this subreddit has sucked so bad .
 it &apos;s absolutely insane that these posts havent been banned like dae .
 4 years on reddit and still thinks mods will ever do shit (with the exception of /r/askhistorians) .
 i admire your optimism .
 hey reddit ,  if comcast made circumcisions mandatory would you be happy or sad ?
 take lungs now ,  gills come in 2 weeks !
 first ever gold is because of futurama !
 but i’m not dead yet !
  are they filled with ice ?
 yeah ,  alright ,  you talked me into it .
 well ,  it is the state church .
 there &apos;s no separation between church and state in iceland .
 which is surprising ,  because even all the genuinely christian icelanders i know all want there to be separation .
 which makes sense ,  because they &apos;re all in a fríkirkja (free church/non-state run church)
 wait until you hear about church tax in germany .
 the church tax ,  i think germany have it as well 
 there is an interesting book called nudge which discusses decision architecture .
   basically ,  you can manipulate people into making the decisions that you want them to make by changing the order in which options are presented or by making your desired option the default .
  it &apos;s really interesting and this is one of the prime examples that the author uses .
  countries that have opt out systems vs opt in systems have significantly higher donor rates because people simply don &apos;t opt out .
 it’s not that i don’t care ,  it’s just that where i live i have to print out a form ,  fill it out ,  and mail it in .
 i just don’t care enough to be bothered to .
 if i was as easy as checking a box ,  i would 100% do it .
 i’m not in the us or uk .
 also ,  i would opt in to donate ,  because apparently it was not clear to some .
 can you opt out from specific organs ?
 no need to explain yourself though .
 it &apos;s perfectly okay if you did opt-out !
 i &apos;m all for it though ,  as long as it &apos;s this easy to opt-out for whoever is not comfortable with this .
 thing is that a lot of old people can &apos;t  &apos;just opt out online &apos; i &apos;m not against the idea ,  i &apos;m playing devil &apos;s advocate here .
 but this discussion was created in holland about 2 years ago .
 people didn &apos;t like the government deciding for them this way ,  they didn &apos;t want to be forced to act if they wanted their body to remain  &apos;their own &apos;  
 i am required to opt out due to a pre-existing condition because my immune system isn &apos;t working property (and hence a specific blood cell) .
 currently it &apos;s unknown if it can be transmitted through transfusion so i &apos;ve been told i am no longer permitted to give blood or donate organs .
 some people believe that if a doctor knows you &apos;re a donor they may not try as hard to save you ,  and use you for parts .
 some patients have religious reasons .
  i believe some native american cultures believe you have to be buried whole in order to enter the afterlife .
  even getting the gallbladder removed is a huge deal and if the hospital loses it they fuck up the person &apos;s afterlife .
   i dont exactly which native culture believes this ,  but we learned that in nursing school .
 i &apos;m totally for the auto organ donor status .
  2 people in my life have been saved by organ donation .
  i &apos;m an er nurse and the stress on patients waiting for an organ is so sad .
  if the opportunity arises for me to donate organs i want everything used - eyes ,  hair ,  skin ,  kidneys ,  liver ,  lungs - you name it .
 i dont need it anymore .
 like ,  i want to say seventh day adventists(maybe) won &apos;t give or accept blood transfusions .
 sorry to the sdas who make super yummy vegetarian food !
 i &apos;ve been informed by another comment that it &apos;s some other group that don &apos;t do blood transfusions .
 i have 4 different autoimmune diseases ,  so unless i start getting mine replaced ,  they’re pretty much useless .
 if i get in a car crash and wind up brain dead ,  i don’t want to give a possible recipient false hope while i’m on a table with surgeons finding my organs useless .
 i lived in an area in the mid-90 &apos;s with a big mad cow scare .
 due to that ,  i can &apos;t donate blood or organs .
 better safe than sorry .
 doctors are trying to save everybody ,  not picking and choosing who gets to live .
 they won &apos;t let you die when they could save you ,  there &apos;s no guarantee the organs will be a match or successful in transplantation .
 plus they open themselves up to criticism if every patient they attend to dies in er .
 organ donation isn &apos;t using you as an organ factory ,  it &apos;s saying  &apos;well they &apos;ve died ,  but they were willing to save people with the organs they no longer need ,  so lets honor their wish and not let their death be in vain &apos;
 to be fair ,  motorcycles are called donorcycles by er staff .
 yep ,  it’s a stupid trope in medical shows .
 i think that’s where some people get the fear from .
 just to play devil’s advocate .
 if her husband is brain dead ,  is he really going to get any meaningful use out of that kidney ?
 (i do understand your point ,  though .
 i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
 it can be tricky though .
 my cousin was stabbed in the head and deciding to pull the plug and donate his organs really pulled apart the family for years .
 it didn &apos;t help that the counselor of sorts seemed like a sleazy organ dealer who really lays it on heavy that your loved one doesn &apos;t need them anymore .
 in this moment of trauma it becomes not about you ,  not about your loved one ,  but about other people .
 i trust the drs .
 when they say your loved one is brain dead .
 but when their body is there breathing and his head swollen part of you doesn &apos;t understand why you can &apos;t just wait longer ,  hope longer .
 see him lose the swelling and maybe give you just one more look before you give up on them .
 eta and just to be clear ,  i think this bill is a good thing and i am a donor myself .
 it &apos;s just a sad affair sometimes and more complex than it seems .
 that can sometimes be true .
 my cousin passed away very suddenly a little over a year ago and was an organ donor .
 unfortunately because of her situation the only organs viable for harvesting were her skin and i believe her eyes (which i had no idea eyes were donatable in the first place ,  but it &apos;s what i was told) .
 due to having literally no skin ,  we were unable to have an open casket funeral for her .
 father steals mans heart to spend 13 more years with son
 i &apos;ve had two and a half years with my beautiful wife thanks to two lung donors .
 hoping for an extra ___ with my mom right now thanks to a kidney donor .
  it &apos;s a scary time .
 honestly ,  donors are heros on their own right .
 i was 28 before i realized that i don &apos;t care about my organs after i die ,  so they should at least help someone if given the opportunity .
 got an extra 20 years and counting with my grandpa thanks to the heart and both lungs of an unfortunate motorcycle rider .
 transplant technology is amazing .
 my dad passed away suddenly in may and his corneas were able to be successfully transplanted .
 someone now has the gift of sight thanks to my dad !
 i’m so sorry for you loss but glad you are comforted by your fiancee’s donations too .
 pieces of him living on ,  shared to others and allowing them to live better .
 our entire family was able to confidently say  &apos;yes ,  she wanted her organs donated .
 exactly how it should be .
  if you don &apos;t want to give into the system ,  then you &apos;re last choice to get out of the system .
  it costs you literally nothing to donate your organs since you &apos;re dead anyway ,  but the payoff for someone else could be life and death .
 if you refuse to help others in even when it doesn &apos;t matter to you ,  don &apos;t expect others to give you help when you are the one in need .
 15 years with a donor heart ?
 that is amazing .
 its a dick move .
 let &apos;s put someone else &apos;s hands together for iceland 
 this is what my grandmother did .
 you get more than a foot or something ,  i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s permanently removed - not my field .
 i do know it took about 3 yrs .
 before we got ashes to bury so they take their time with the cadaver ,  that &apos;s for sure .
 i &apos;m the one who actually laid the ashes in the ground ,  never forget it .
 she liked beer and chocolate so we all had a bit of that at the service in rural nova scotia (upper stewiacke) with about 15 people in plain clothes ,  no preacher or strangers .
 anyway ,  don &apos;t know why i got into all of that .
 if you or anyone else is interested in the life your body could potentially lead after death ,  i want to recommend the book  &apos;stiff: the curious lives of human cadavers &apos; by mary roach .
 it has a section about bodies donated to medical schools but also explores other uses such as crash test dummies and decomposition research .
 lots of things you never consider when  &apos;donating to science &apos; .
 i wanna be one of those bodies that they let rot in strange places to research time of death and decomposition accuracy .
 i hope i get ,   &apos;buried in a drum of bacon grease .
 i heard the majority of donated heads go into plastic surgery schools to be given face lifts and such by students !
 check out “stiff” by mary roach .
 she writes about all aspects of cadavers .
 give my healthy organs to sick people who need it ,  give to science whatever it can use ,  toss the rest in a ditch and leave it to the rats .
 i won &apos;t give a shit ,  i &apos;m dead .
 i would do maybe do that that .
 and if they didn &apos;t want me then i would just want a natural burial ,  no expensive pointless coffin .
 not getting pumped with weird chemicals also expensive .
 just wrapped in some linens and buried ,  maybe plant a tree on top of me .
 id rather feed a tree than a fire .
 when i &apos;m dead just throw me in the traesh
 i’m not trying to encourage or dissuade you ,  but my grandfather went that route and donated his body to the local college’s medical school .
 it took at least 2 or 3 years for my grandmother to get his cremated remains back ,  which really tore her up .
 if you are thinking about it ,  i would like you to know that they treat bodies with the utmost respect .
 if the body is separated and used for different purposes they will keep track of everything so that it is returned and cremated in a proper method .
 sometimes ,  if the body goes to a med school or similar teaching setting they will have a ceremony where you can hear from the students how grateful they are for the sacrifice your family member made for science .
 more likely than not ,  he made a typo .
 i met a guy from there who told me that he literally has to make sure someone isn &apos;t related to him in some way before they start dating .
 as a person from iceland ,  there &apos;s good odds that he was fucking with you .
 there is an app based on our genetic databanks maintained by the government with assistance from decode genetics that can be used for that purpose but it is intended as a easier/portable version of the website ,  which is mainly for genealogical purposes .
 as to the increased chance of successful transplant ,  i think so ?
 has to make sure someone isn &apos;t related to him in some way before they start dating .
 this sentence confuses people from alabama
 i hate it ,  because then it means 40k will never come true .
 they didn &apos;t help ,  we tried .
 the hospital said they tried to save his life and marked his time of death at over an hour after he arrived .
 he was dead before my dad called 911 .
 i don &apos;t know if youve ever seen what a hollow point round does to your skull ,  but it &apos;s a fucking joke that they claimed they attempted to save him .
 i &apos;d love to see a film or a book with that concept .
 sean lock is the funniest motherfucker ,  i can &apos;t get over it .

 how do you feel about this ?
 nah that &apos;s socialism ,  poors can just deal with the cholera
 nestle wants to know your location .
 even worse:  am i the asshole ?
 so i recently got a new job and stated making money .
 i donated 20% to a local orphanage ,  20% to a homeless shelter ,  and then 20% to a rape centre .
 i also gave 30% to my family .
 my mother got angry and said i should have given money to the christian wildlife fund for christian animals .
 actually gonna ask the first one lmao gimme that 30k karma .
 of course ,  we all know that i &apos;ll get 2 karma if i &apos;m lucky .
 reddit the cure to cancer has been created ,  how do you feel about that ?

  which one do you choose ?

 man i wish redditors would upvote quality content .
 but nope ,  every sub i go it &apos;s this crap .

 what &apos;s the difference between state churches vs free churches ?
 besides one receiving money from the government and the other not .
 soooo we are naturally lazy
 same situation with auto-enrollment 401k plans .
 which is kind of sad it takes people to be auto-enrolled to save in the grand scheme of things .
 where do you live ?
 in the us ,  when you get your driver &apos;s license/learner &apos;s permit ,  you are asked whether you want to be a donor or not .
 also super easy .
 there are three options .
 donate (default); donate ,  except for specific organs (there &apos;s a textbox where you list the organs); and don &apos;t donate .
 most old people &apos;s organs aren &apos;t that good anymore because of the milage on them .
 i don &apos;t think elderly people make the best organ donor candidates anyways .
 easy ,  just don &apos;t die then
 the information campaign made it very clear that non computer users only have to talk to their doctor on their next visit ,  or a nurse at their health clinic .
 also it should just apply to new 18 year olds .
 leave the system the old one for people that have already turned 18 .
 guys i meant automatic for those fresh 18 year olds .
 everyone else manually opt in since there are some that will be unaware or technologically inept .
 i know you aren &apos;t  &apos;people &apos; but the government is no more deciding for you now than they did before .
 i &apos;m the same way ,  because of my medical history (also immune related i &apos;m not allowed to donate blood or organs .
 i &apos;m also not able to vaccines or flu shots due to said issues ,  which makes things interesting with the whole anti vax movement
 important to clarify - this is very much not the case .
 doctors do not know about your donor status ,  and organs are not harvested until death or true brain death has occurred .
 i’ve also always wondered at this - why would a doctor neglect one patient to the point of death to harvest their organs ?
 to save another patient ?
 that’s sort of taking the long way around to save a life when they could’ve just treated the first guy .
 yes yes ,  everyone ,  yes ,  you can save more than one person with a single human &apos;s worth of organs .
 thank you for explaining .
 a number of patients died this winter period .
 i do not have a clue if any of them were organ donors (although they probably wouldn’t have great organs anyway) .
 completely different doctors working in different areas ,  though .
 you’re not going to have a top transplant consultant working in a&e/er .
 it &apos;s important and funny to note that: .
 even if this practice was common ,  you &apos;d be more likely to be saved by this practice than killed by it .
 some people \wrongly\ believe
 this belief is always hilarious to me ,  it &apos;s like these people just think a doctor goes  &apos;uh oh ,  need a kidney in room 319 ,  better just go grab one out of that guy that kicked it down the hall &apos; lmfao
 those are jehovah’s witnesses .
 i &apos;m sda ,  we &apos;re cool with blood transfusions and transplants .
 just had a bone marrow one recently ,  actually .
 church members held a drove to all get tested to be a match .
 jehovah &apos;s witnesses donate and receive organs .
 when i was learning to drive my parents warned me over and over that they &apos;re going to ask if i want to be an organ donor when i get my license and i need to be sure to say no or else i &apos;ll just be left to die if i ever get injured and go to a hospital because it will make them lots of money to harvest me .
 that &apos;s nonsense of course ,  they &apos;d let me die because i don &apos;t have insurance .
 well in a triage situation that kind of goes out the window but they still aren &apos;t picking who lives and dies based on organ donor status .
 it didn &apos;t help that the counselor of sorts seemed like a sleazy organ dealer who really lays it on heavy that your loved one doesn &apos;t need them anymore .
 in this moment of trauma it becomes not about you ,  not about your loved one ,  but about other people .
 and iceland &apos;s measure would remove this situation ,  really .
 because no longer would physicians have to hawk organ donation to grieving families ,  but could just check if there was an opt-out status ,  and if not just start making preparations for any organs that were to be donated without disturbing the family or making them decide anything .
 a dissection ceremony .
 i want to know that the in-laws know how well mama took care of her liver !
 eyes are an important one for donation .
 however my mum always said she &apos;d be happy to donate anything except her eyes .
 she wanted to be able to see her mum when she died .
 illogical i know ,  but very poignant .
 unfortunately she passed away at home unexpectedly so couldn &apos;t donate anything .
 i did however have a friend who became a donor after committing suicide .
 he was brain dead but still at the point where his organs were usable .
 at least something good came of that tragedy .
 why did she need 4 lungs ?
 my boyfriend got nine with his dad because of a teenage lung donor .
 his whole extended family are donors ,  and they asked for people to sign up in his memory when rejection finally took him .
 all the very best to you both .
 luckily for kidney transplants ,  you can be given living donor kidneys because you can survive just fine with one .
 i hope your mom gets one soon .
 i &apos;m rooting for your mom .
 thank you very much for sharing your story .
  i hope your doing better now after the surgery .
 you &apos;d have to fight an arm and a leg to get it from me .
 i &apos;m actually really stoked and hope us ozzies follow soon after
 eye see what you all did there !
 my grandpa (i never met him) died in the 60s ,  he wanted his body given to the medical school .
 my mom is doing the same ,  has convinced my step dad to and i plan on doing so as well .
 i don &apos;t need a little piece of land that nobody ever gets to use again .
 and my mom always used to tell me her dad viewed it like this .
  &apos;when i &apos;m dead ,  i won &apos;t need my body any more ,  if some drunk med student breaks into the lab ,  cuts my arm off and hangs it up in the frat house as a prank ,  they &apos;re still getting more use out of it than i am .
  &apos; sounds like he was a pragmatist .
 that sounds lovely - it truly honoured her and avoided all the other fluff (no offence to anyone) .
 i live in nb ,   that sounds like a maritime thing !
 sorry for your loss .
 rural nova scotia .
 isn &apos;t that kind of redundant ?
 i am not a viable organ donor due to 7 autoimmune diseases .
 are all cadavers “healthy” or do you also get to look at people who have a bit more story to their anatomy ?
 by the time i’m dead ,  i’ll have even more chapters of minor and major surgeries for my current health roster ,  maybe even some new things .
 i would love for some students to learn from my body’s story .
 is that possible ?
 just a blanket “donate to science” isn’t what i want .
 i feel like i’m being conceited but i believe that my body has more to give than being a crash test dummy or seeing how i decompose .
  &apos;when i &apos;m dead ,  just throw me in the trash &apos;
 my grandpa donated his body to science ,  and i went to the ceremony .
 i remember how genuinely the speaker thanked us (the families) and our loved ones .
 i also remember seeing the students that attended nod in agreement ,  and how respectful they all were .
 it was hard to mourn him again so long after his death ,  but the ceremony was beautiful and it made me so proud of his choice !
 that‘s quite beautiful actually
 i &apos;ve read the book .
 even the crash test dummies and forensic decomposition research subjects are used to save lives .
 it &apos;s not glamorous ,  but making a car more safe for people driving them ,  or finding ways to catch murderers would still be an honor .
 i highly recommend this book too .
 mary roach writes with a disarming charm and dry humor 
 i second this recommendation !
 i read this book years ago and still talk about it today when a subject like this comes up .
  it’s well-written ,  compassionate and even occasionally humorous .
 i watched that episode when ozzy osborne and his son ,  jack ,  went to that university run body farm .
 it was super interesting and definitely weird with all the bodies hanging out everywhere on the grounds .
 you can donate it to a body farm .
 the two big ones i know of are university of tennessee in knoxville ,  tn  ,  and western carolina university in cullowhee ,  nc .
 they take bodies and use them for the forensics classes
 just throw me in the trash
 i have multiple genetic illnesses so i can &apos;t donate my organs ,  eyes or skin or anything ,  but for the same reason when i spoke with a representative who manages cadaver donations from the university who is doing some research on my condition they ecstatically told me they are in desperate need of post mortem donations to further advance the treatments for people living with my condition .
 i almost can &apos;t wait to die now .
 (not in a suicidal way ,  just that i &apos;m really comfortable with the fact that we are mortal ,  and my death a loss in the big picture of earth)  .
 if for some reason they can &apos;t take my body at time of death ,  i &apos;ve got directives for a cheap green burial .
 i don &apos;t understand caskets and headstones ,  i &apos;m comforted by the idea my body will rot naturally back into the earth rather than toxically ferment in a box full of carcinogenic chemicals for no reason other than it &apos;s a relatively modern human tradition to try and preserve our dead .
 they &apos;re dead ,  let them go .
 i knew i &apos;d see this here !
 god damn it frank .
 often a cadaver will be dissected by a few medical students ,  and then if a piece of them is particularly “good , ” that piece may be used for further learning purposes .
 at my medical school ,  we had a large ceremony at the end of our dissection time where we invited the families of the donors .
 they were invited to say things ,  and our anatomy professors talked .
 then at the end ,  we had a native american ceremony (we’re in az with a large na population) ,  and we planted a memorial tree for the donors from our graduating class .
 everyone treated the donors with the utmost respect from beginning to end .
 and yes the cadaver was used for over a year and the remaining pieces were cremated and returned to the families .
 when i signed up to do this it told me my body could be used for up to 5 years ,  so he might &apos;ve known that .
 nope ,  he &apos;s used it a few times in his immediate post history .
 i can vaguely remember a thriller/horror movie where a girl gets an eye transplant and gets scary visions from the eyes of the donator .
 the girl in the movie is jessica alba and the movie is called  &apos;the eye &apos; .
 i think there was a simpsons treehouse of horror episode where the same thing happened with a hair transplant .
 there’s this book called unwind ,  where they like take body parts from people (live people too) for medical or aesthetic purposes and they use every part ,  even the brain
 there &apos;s a horror movie i saw years ago where a guy has an accident and get &apos;s an arm transplant from a serial killer .
 no idea what it &apos;s called .
 also ,  it probably wasn &apos;t a good movie .
 yes ,  ma &apos;am ,  it &apos;s very impressive .
 i first read it as “i want to be stuffed and given to a lion” .
   _zips back up_ 
 i dunno actually .
 isn’t that the point ?
 you know exactly how reddit feels about that shit
  &apos;hey i &apos;m fishing for gold here !
 you know when people falsely type  &apos;lol &apos; ,  when in actuality they didn &apos;t laugh out loud ?
 i actually laughed ,  out loud at your use of the term  &apos;poors &apos; .
 but what if we took loot boxes out of video games ?
 real question is if winds of winter will ever be released
 just ask reddit if corporation lobbying should be illegal instead and enjoy your karma .
 also ,  you &apos;ve got a triple post here .
 this is honestly not talked about enough today !
 mooching war widows .
 those puppies need to get a job and stop using up all our government assistance programs .
 also the pollutants from all the dog shit would be a negative externality
 is the horse-sized puppy fully grown or will it grow bigger ?
 i &apos;d pick 100 puppy-sized horses for the novelty of it .
 don &apos;t forget /r/protestsignsilike .
 z is just as good .

 why not zoidberg ?
 you might feel large pain
 that’s 4x the amount i need
 the free churches have more say in their theological beliefs and don &apos;t have to adhere to what the government wants taught or expressed from the pulpit .
 as you can imagine ,  this has lead to a scenario where the state churches are more liberal and the free churches are more traditional .
 and trusting of what &apos;s presented as the default choice .
 yes ,  which is why when asking a group of people for something you always ask for who disagrees .
 it is easy to do nothing ,  act unsure ,  or be subject to peer pressure .
 forcing the question the other way forces action to not get what you want .
 yes ,  but not just that .
 if i ask you  &apos;do you want to be an organ donor &apos; i am asking for you to assume a responsibility ,  albeit one that doesn &apos;t actually require effort .
 that makes you think about it and makes you more likely to refuse .
 if i just say you &apos;re an organ donor but if you don &apos;t want to you can opt out ,  it doesn &apos;t require anything of you to do it and requires a decision be made to opt out .
 it &apos;s not just that we &apos;re lazy ,  but that we avoid making decisions unless we have to .
 i feel like i &apos;d be tempted to put something weird .
 like  &apos;left eye ,  skin on my face ,  brain ,  and fingernails &apos; on the opt-out textbox .
 its my dick in a (text)box
 is there any non religious reason for someone to not donate ?
 or to not donate specific organs ?
 i want to do it but i just want to cover my bases
 i dunno ,  if they &apos;re serviced annually ,  and have regular oil and filter changes they should be ok .
 this is iceland so i think they &apos;re more concerned with kilometerage .
 i got a double lung transplant and they said if the donor was over 65 years of age i would need to sign a paper acknowledging i’m getting lungs from a person that old .
 any younger they just transplanted as long as they are in good condition .
 organ failure patients hate him !
 that &apos;s actually very clever !
 especially since young people &apos;s organs are way more valuable .
 i mean after they die of course .
 ahh grandfathering the grandfathers .
 i didn &apos;t want your stupid organs ,  anyway !
 runs away in tears .
 same here ,  because of lupus and chemo treatments .
 i’ve heard that i can donate my eyes though ,  not sure how true it is .
 not advocating that it happens but i think the fear comes from the idea that you would most likely save more than one person by donating multiple organs .
 so one dies but i saved 4 with the organs .
 however ,  this idea seems so absurd as i don &apos;t think any doctor would like someone to die in their watch and i feel like it &apos;d be pretty easy to spot a trend of every organ donor is seemingly dying with this one doctor .
 i think the worry or argument is that the doctor could neglect one patient to the point of death in order to harvest their organs and save multiple other people ,  not just one death for one life .
 cries in american
 dead or debt ,  that’s the american way !
 i &apos;m still a donor though .
 shoot ,  i tried twice to donate my kidneys while i &apos;m alive !
 in triage ,  they put the least serious cases aside for later .
 they &apos;re trying to save everybody by maximizing time .
 a guy with a broken leg is going to be around in an hour for help ,  a guy with a bullet in the chest probably won &apos;t .
 this wouldn &apos;t be information available during triage situations .
 and nurses are the ones who triage ,  anyway .
 aside from what others pointed out about the charges being overturned ,  note that the article says multiple times that this is  &apos;the first time &apos; and  &apos;unprecedented .
  &apos; drawing a conclusion from one possible case is not comparable to seeing something many times on tv until you think it &apos;s true .
 yeah ,  i think that is absolutely essential .
 because while a lot of my family may have been supportive or ambivalent about organ donation before ,  i can tell you it left more than a bad impression on everyone and turned quite a few against it .
 it &apos;s a miracle process for some and a horror show for others -- this policy seems ideal in that it normalizes it for everyone .
 because the first transplanted set went into rejection .
 to breathe underwater of course .
 eye agree ,  liver die ain’t nobody taking my organs .
 just kidding hack away
 over my dead body .
 just don’t get cold feet if you go through with it 
 after the anatomy class where all the med students have finished their dissection (and they really do use the whoooollle thing from my understanding) ,  at my sister &apos;s med school there was a very solemn & moving ceremony for the students which was basically to show gratitude for the generosity of the body donors so that the students could learn and become good at their profession .
 med student here .
 lol &apos;d at the image of an arm on display somewhere like that .
 i can assure it &apos;s highly unlikely albeit the thought is funny .
 there &apos;s a ton of rules and respect around cadavers .
 they &apos;re some of our best teachers .
 not only does that land never get used ,  but noone really visits after one generation .
 i loved my grandparents dearly ,  but in the 15ish years they have been gone ,  i &apos;ve been to their graves only once .
 they are in my mind ,  my memories and my heart .
 whatever is in that hole in the ground no longer represents the intelligent ,  good natured ,  funny ,  sweet people they were .
 actually once a grave site runs out of spaces there &apos;s a chance your remains will be dug up and moved somewhere else .
 see: paris catacombs
 maritime culture is the best culture .
 i thank god my family all came from nova scotia for several generations .
 i have records of relatives in the halifax explosion .
 one great-great uncle once removed or some nonsense rushed down to the basement and fell .
 he landed on a sack of potatoes that saved him from serious injury .
 i love little snapshots of life like that .
 i can be downtown truro or something and it still feels like  &apos;yep ,  this is a town ,  not a city really &apos; - trailer park boys filmed right up the road from truro actually .
 i completely agree .
 i hadn &apos;t seriously thought about it before reading this book but now i really like the idea .
 plus i &apos;ve always hated the idea of paying a lot of money to bury or cremate my remains so this is doubly good .
 help people learn and save my family money .
 that university run body farm .
 okay now that is bout to get googled !
 now i just need to think of a humorous tattoo to liven up that class and ease the burden of having to gawp at my naked corpse .
 diogenes is the world &apos;s single greatest troll
 such a cynical bastard .
 i &apos;d rather be taxidermied ,  dressed as ronald mcdonald and put on display at a mcdonalds .
 thats actually bad for the environment btw .
 your body can contaminate water sources with all the bacteria and stuff inside your body .
 this is relevant to a post i made a while ago .
 it’s long ,  but people thought it was funny ,  so i’m going to post it here: .
 this reminds me of an experience i had just a few months after i graduated from college and just before i left ems .
 i’ve never had an opportunity to share it with anyone before .
 tl;dr ems and fire buddies had friend die of cancer .
 friend donates his body to science .
 a year and a half later they witness his skull being uncapped and hear me talk about his strong rectum .
 (and i hope i give encouragement to op) .
 i was employed at a relatively rural ems department during college .
 i say relatively ,  because for the overall region it wasn’t too big ,  but we serviced the whole county as well as a university of about 12k students .
 the town itself had a population of a little over 10k ,  so during the school year our call volume sky-rocketed .
  we were a pseudo-volunteer group of about 20 trained providers and everyone got along really well .
 many of them were from the town and volunteered on the fire department .
 just before i was hired in september 2010 ,  there was a well-loved guy employed there nicknamed chips who was a good friend to pretty much every person in the department .
 during my first few months everyone talked about this guy like he was just on extended sick leave and i’d get to meet him soon .
 after another few months ,  i learned that chips had stage iii pancreatic cancer and he likely wouldn’t be coming back anytime soon .
 around that same time everyone’s outlook about this friend changed dramatically .
 whenever we were bullshitting at the station after a call or our weekly meetings ,  chips’ friends would make plans to go visit him in the hospital ,  sneak him beers ,  and stuff like that .
 in the summer of 2012 ,  the news came that chips had died .
 he had managed to keep the cancer at bay for a little over a year ,  but the prognosis quickly worsened ,  so he decided he was done with treatment and wanted to die peacefully surrounded by his family .
 it sucked because i never met the guy ,  but i had nonetheless managed to become pretty attached to him through my coworkers .
 chips had apparently wanted to be a tissue donor ,  but because of the cancer he obviously wasn’t able to do that .
 so he did the next best thing and donated his body to the cadaver lab at the university’s medical school .
 for those of you who don’t know ,  the preparation of a cadaver for teaching purposes can be fairly complex and is more than just pushing formaldehyde through vessels and tissues .
 depending on the desires of the professor and needs of the classes ,  different cadavers can be prepared in different ways ,  which can make the process take as long as a couple years in some cases (i didn’t know this at the time) .
 as time went on ,  i worked hard and matured as a provider; because of our relatively rural status we got to do some fairly advanced things that in most service areas would be far outside the typical scope of practice .
 along with that extra responsibility ,  we also did a lot of administrative and community outreach things .
 one of my duties ,  among other things ,  was to develop and coordinate continuing education for the department .
 i got sick of working with dummies and playing theater for trainings so i asked the director if i could try to hook us up at the university cadaver lab for a day .
 he said go for it .
 i was ecstatic .
 i made the necessary calls and talked to the necessary people and scheduled our continuing ed day for sometime in mid-october of 2013 .
 the day comes and we’re all super excited—not many ems agencies get that kind of access to cadaveric labs .
 it was more than just anatomy lessons ,  it was cardiocentises ,  real-time pathophysiology of and treatments for tension pneumos ,  different airway management lessons ,  even some stuff we didn’t need to learn and could never do in the field (like using laparoscopes and threading cardiac catheters to the coronary arteries using a really ancient x-ray fluoroscope and a diy “perfusion” machine a few students had made) .
 after signing confidentiality and ethics forms ,  all 20 of us walked down to the basement into this pristine cadaver lab .
 when we entered there were a couple decedents lying on dissection tables welcoming us to learn from them .
 these had been partially dissected over the course of the semester by medical students .
 there was one decedent ,  however ,  on the other side of the room that was covered head to toe by a white sheet .
 when the anatomist finished showing us the basics of what they do at the lab and what the med students were working on ,  he walked over to the draped decedent and says ,  “now i’m gonna show you how we do it !
 ” and hastily pulled the drape off .
 the anterior and posterior scalp had been bluntly dissected and retracted to expose the skull cap ,  but otherwise there was no evidence of any other dissection .
 i was nervous ,  (i hadn’t actually seen a dead body before) ,  so when the sheet had been removed i kind of just stared at the person for a little bit before thinking ,  “okay ,  staring is bad and i feel like i’ve been doing it for way too long .
 ” when i looked up and glanced at my coworkers i noticed that at least half of them appeared white as a ghost with deer-in-the-headlights eyes .
 none of them said a word ,  which i thought was odd because they had all been excited like i had been before .
 i didn’t think much of it and probably chalked it up as them feeling queasy about the process and environment .
 “this decedent died of pancreatic cancer two years ago .
 what i found interesting was his ct scans that were taken a month before his death .
 ” our lecturer showed us a head ct that revealed a confluence of metastases throughout this guy’s brain .
 i still didn’t make the connection .
 “shall we have a look ?
 ” instant bone saw cutting noise (he didn’t wait for an answer he just went to town) .
 my boss says ,  “holy .
 ” and the anatomist responded with ,  “yeah it can be a sight to behold the first time .
 ” our proctor wasn’t being disrespectful ,  mind you ,  but i think he noticed a lot of the group’s horrified expressions behind their attempts to maintain a strong countenance .
 after making a circumferential cut around the skull with the saw ,  he grabs a wedged osteotome (basically a strong ,  flat metal rod with one end thinner than the other) and hammers it into the incised portion of the anterior skull .
 with a skilled twist the skull cap was cleanly removed and set aside .
 if you’ve never been present at an autopsy before ,  this action of brute-forcing the skull cap off is the quickest and most efficient way of gaining access to the brain ,  and it makes a really unique sound—almost like tearing really tough cardboard or breaking a wet stick .
 several coworkers audibly regressed at that point and half the room had stopped watching .
 i hadn’t ,  though ,  because i was eager to learn and also ignorant of the monstrosity some of my coworkers were witnessing (unrelated fact: if you ever have to replace the skull cap back onto the head after an autopsy ,  the sound is even more surreal: like placing together the tops of two empty ,  medium-sized plastic dog bowls) .
 after the proctor went through some basic brain anatomy ,  we were given free reign to explore the bodies and the other stations in the lab (he had to do all the initial incising though) .
 within 10 minutes i was hands deep in this one guy’s abdominal cavity looking and feeling for metastases; identifying and exploring its compartments .
 as i’m doing this ,  my hand happens across an unusual prominence .
 it felt a lot different than any other mets i had come across ,  and his bladder etc obscured my view of it ,  so i asked out loud ,  “whats this tough little nub on his pelvic floor ?
 ” and before anyone could chime in ,  i excitedly realized what it was and loudly exclaimed ,  “oh ,  it’s his rectum !
 jeez ,  that’s way stronger than you would think .
 ” (impressive ,  like ,  ‘wow that’s fascinating , ’ not ,  ‘i’m jealous .
 after that my buddy ,  who was a good friend of chips ,  came over and whispered semi-loudly to me in the most haunting yet hilarious way ,  “that’s fucking chips .
 i thought for a second .
 what the crap is ch .
 i had completely forgotten about chips until then .
 that’s when i died inside .
 the coworkers that knew chips appeared to be in a mental state between mortification and comedic hysterics at this terrible coincidence .
 i pulled some of the guys out into the hallway along with our director ,  who happened to be chips’ best friend ,  and asked if we should cancel .
 they discussed it for maybe a minute but couldn’t stop whimsically laughing .
 apparently this was exactly the kind of macabre prank chips would want to pull on them and they knew he would find the entire situation absolutely hilarious .
 i was told not to tell the anatomist because he probably would have put the kabosh on the whole thing instantly (and we had paid mid-4 figures to secure the spot and time) .
 after a while some of them had acclimated to it ,  though many didn’t feel right doing any poking or prodding (i certainly don’t blame them) .
 we went back to the station and shot the shit with each other about the dark comedy of it all .
 the university had over one hundred a lot of bodies available and ,  unbeknownst to them ,  they happened to choose chips as the central demonstration for that specific day for our specific group .
 for a couple weeks the running joke at work was that i finally got to meet chips and had gone to deeper bases with him than anyone had gone before ,  all within 20 minutes:  .
 “you could have at least bought him dinner first !
 ems people are freaking weird .
 i guess my advice to op is this: remember the good times with your buddy ,  and though it usually takes some time ,  you’ll eventually find yourself laughing as you remember the good memories of your friend .
 sorry for your loss .
 cancer indeed sucks .
 just means he can &apos;t spell ?
 maybe he doesn &apos;t know the spelling of the word ?
 there are lots of people who exclusively use inquire or enquire ,  who couldn &apos;t tell you why they use the one they do and don &apos;t know that both are correct ,  or people who mistake elusive and illusive ,  even though there are some contexts where both could be correct .
 did they steal that from the simpsons ?
 where homer gets a hair transplant in a treehouse of horror and becomes snake
 to anyone interested in seeing this - the alba film is a very mediocre remake of a much better thai/hong kong film the eye (2002) aka seeing ghost .
 not a masterpiece by any means ,  but a solid horror flick that rode the peak of the early 00s j-horror wave .
 surely you can’t be serious .
 now do you remember ?
 but the lion never got to relieve himself !
 you know exactly the point of that shit
 op has just made a comment for the sole purpose of farming karma .
 how do you feel about this ?
 holy fucking shit
 especially this thing ,  which has tons of books written on the subject ,  as well as being part of the mainstream discussion for decades .
 and the burden on the planet of producing ,  packaging ,  transporting ,  and storing all the dog food that becomes the dog shit .
 your reference to  &apos;externality &apos; just gave me a flashback to my college economics course .
  i think it &apos;s passing ,  i &apos;ll be okay .
 if you have to ask ,  you can &apos;t afford it .
 depends on the anus
 crusader kings taught me this .
 the pope doesn &apos;t like free investiture haha .
 german as well ,  i always found it a bit ironic that we kept (or introduced ?
 ) this system after ww2 .
 oh how handy to have a govermental register where all people are listed with their corresponding religious affiliation .
 sounds like an evolved mechanism to avoid unnecessary energy usage by the brain
 they are only allowed to have one testicle .
 the other is sacred .
 „why the fuck would someone put in the textbox skeleton .
 please don &apos;t ever put eyes there .
 i happen to be able to have vision in my eye because of a donor after getting shot with an arrow when i was 15 ,  and i &apos;d hate for someone to see this and follow through for fun .
 some diseases can make some-all of your organs nonviable for donation ,  tho i would think that would be marked by medical professionals already so individuals may not have to do that for themselves .
 another 1 that i know is that there are some people who just feel very strongly that their body should be left alone after they die .
  &apos;we don &apos;t want your kidney .
 you &apos;re 104 years old .
  &apos;yeah ,  but it &apos;s all highway years .
 that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been getting my oil checked regularly ,  i &apos;m not gonna be giving out some 10 second organs .
 i know i gave grandma a good servicing every 5 , 000 miles or so .
 she always did seem to run pretty hot ,  though .
 also before they die .
 but i think you have to opt into that program 
 just tie it to people getting their drivers license ,  when you take the test and pass you also decide if you want to opt out or not ,  but have it like singapore ,  if you opt out you go to the back of the line should you ever need an organ yourself lol 
 too slow of a process to affect any real change if only applied at 18 .
 iceland has a population of about 340k and only has birth cohorts of about 4k .
 although clever ,  doing it that way would piss just as many people off without meaningfully impacting organ donation rates .
 well the thing about this is that with the current donor shortage it might almost be viable to  &apos;take &apos; one life to save a few others .
 but if everyone is a donor then suddenly we &apos;ll have more organs than we know what to do with .
 so there should be practically no shortage ,  hence no fear they might  &apos;need &apos; your organs .
 you might consider keeping at least one of those .
 unless you get the black card .
 then they are deciding you aren &apos;t worth saving .
 what the hell is this sub lmao
 i demand an explanation 
 oh ,  makes sense .
 sorry to hijack your post but i can &apos;t imagine what you and your wife must of gone through during that time .
 to be in the mindset that you &apos;ve finally found a donor just for your body to reject them must be awful .
 i &apos;m glad you found a donor who &apos;s lungs weren &apos;t rejected and i wish you all the best moving forward !
 she loved this answer
 i &apos;m not sure what part of my body would be kneeded by anyone .
 rip me to pieces
 just kidneying around ,  take what you need .
 this is fantastic .
  this was someone &apos;s personal vehicle ,  their own quiet place they took everywhere with them .
 the medium with how they experience everything in this world .
  now they are done with it they want it to continue to do good for others .
  my grandmother did this .
  i miss her but it does make me proud to be her grandchild and i will definitely be doing the same when i &apos;ve had my fun here .
 i have a lot of friends in medical school (i was supposed to go too when they did but took time off instead and have kept up with them) and they’ve said that a lot of people cry before ,  during ,  and after the dissection and feel a lot of respect and gratitude for the person who donated their body .
 they usually have a hard time cutting into someone they know had a life and is being grieved by people somewhere so they treat the cadavers with a lot of respect through the whole process and afterwards .
 plus people who disrespect the cadavers get in a shit ton of trouble at least failing the class .
 when my dad was in school in the 70 &apos;s some guys thought it would be funny to cut off an arm and go on a toll road and then when they paid the toll person they gave him the cadaver &apos;s arm and drove off .
 they got caught and all were expelled .
 iirc ,  in most places goofing around with a donor cadaver is grounds for expulsion .
 the cadaver was the thing that convinced me i couldn &apos;t handle medicine .
 i had fun learning and everything but once we took the trip to see the body i just got woozy and did not have a good time .
 this was a high school anatomy class ,  we took a field trip to the science lab of a college at the end of each semester .
 my biggest regret in life (well ,  death) will be that i can &apos;t be around to see med students poking around my body and brain to see why i am so fucked up ,  lol .
 i &apos;m a very curious person .
 some kids at my high school stole our mummy and tied it to a ceiling fan ,  the leg broke off at the ankle and spun around until the staff arrived the next morning .
 the teachers all said that room never smelled the same .
 i lost my mom 8 years ago .
 she really took her time choosing her final resting place .
 not too far so everyone in the family could visit ,  not too cold (for her ,  funny enough - she’s in a mausoleum ,  said she didn’t want to be in the cold ,  hard ground .
 side note: mausoleums are freezing for those of us on the other side !
 it’s a beautiful spot .
 but i don’t visit very often .
 i think of her every single day .
 i share my sorrows ,  triumphs and mundane shit with her all the time ,  usually in my head or aloud when i’m driving alone .
 personally ,  i like the idea of being burned on a pyre in a beautiful field ,  but i’m pretty sure it’s illegal in canada and i don’t know how it’d smell (for those mourning me) haha .
 so i’ve settled on being cremated ,  or possibly being turned into a piece of jewellery .
 either way you’re right ,  we don’t need the space once we’re gone .
 also from rural ns but can trace my family back to angus walters the captian of the blue nose and that &apos;s not relevant but super cool none the less xp
 you just threw me for a minute .
 i live about 5 miles from truro ,  cornwall ,  uk and although it &apos;s technically a city ,  you can walk across in about 10 minutes .
 it &apos;s in knoxville .
 actually called the body farm
 mislabel your body parts .
 if your trash is draining into your water supply ,  the potential cadavers aren &apos;t among the worst of your worries .
 i think they were just referencing always sunny in philadelphia .
 i upvoted this the first time you posted it ,  and i’m upvoting it again now .
 beautiful story; i hope chips would be proud .
 but it &apos;s a correct (if archaic) spelling of the word .
 so he can spell ,  but he &apos;s a time traveler .
 he should encrease his lexicon .
 actually it goes back further than that - the treehouse of horror segment (treehouse of horror ix from 1998) was inspired by an amazing stories episode  &apos;hell toupee &apos; from 1986 (directed by empire strikes back helmer irvin kershner ,  though admittedly a weak episode) with a largely similar plot of a haunted toupee ,  which was itself in turn inspired by a great twilight zone episode  &apos;dead man &apos;s shoes &apos; from 1962 ,  about a pair of haunted shoes taking over a homeless man &apos;s life .
 there was also an x-files episode of a haunted tattoo ,   &apos;never again &apos; from 1997 ,  with a similar premise where the tattoo has its own personality (voiced by jodie foster ,  no less) and makes the wearer do things .
 the eye is notably different in the sense that the protagonist doesn &apos;t act like the original person the eyes belonged to ,  it just makes her see ghosts as the eye came from a psychic .
 what hasn &apos;t been stolen from the simpsons ?
 i am serious ,  and don &apos;t call me shirley .
 it &apos;s a big building with patients ,  but that &apos;s not important right now .

 ea bad ,  witcher good ,  upvotes to the left
 dog shit isn &apos;t fertilizer
 that was the f ray .
 iceland about to be excommunicated .
 they &apos;re not getting lefty
  &apos;the lower bollock ,  which so ever that may be ,  must be retained .
 after death i must be left with exactly one testicle ,  regardless of circumstance .
  they can take both provided they give me one from another donor in return .
 and they have to guess which one is which entirely by mouthfeel .
 donate except for organ &apos;); drop table organs;--
 nah ,  they didn &apos;t say they wanted to donate a lizard ,   a sfdeljknesv ,  and -1 beers .
  &apos;got a new heart at 50 &apos;
 he &apos;s the second owner .
 the first owner was only 65 .
 he got it from the first owner at 100 .
  &apos;read the fine print ,  it doesn &apos;t say when &apos; .
 what about us who don’t drive ?
 there was a study a few years ago ,  funded by the northern ireland assembly when they considered moving to an opt-out system ,  which found that it &apos;s basically impossible to meet the demand for organs in modern society using only human transplants .
 until xenotransplantation or tissue engineering become common practice there are always going to be people waiting for spare parts .
 this will save lives and better peoples living standard ,  but there is no way to simply end organ demand issues .
 i wasn &apos;t a match either time :( i &apos;d still do it though ,  i only need one and no history of kidney issues in the family .
 i did ,  however ,  have a doctor (maybe she was an np ?
 ) tell me ,  upon my telling her i &apos;d like to be a donor ,   &apos;and your mother let you go through with the testing ?
 i would never let my child donate an organ !
  &apos; i promptly never went back to that entire office .
 was trying out other docs after mine retired and nope .
 it looks like shitty stock photos or something .
 judging by the potato cat and then the dude with the pistol .
 but then there &apos;s the chick with hairy armpits showing off her fat pale tits ,  so i have no clue .
 that went from  &apos;lol &apos; to deadpan  &apos;oh &apos; real quick .
 this was someone &apos;s personal vehicle ,  their own quiet place they took everywhere with them .
 the medium with how they experience everything in this world .
 thank you for this beautiful description of the human body .
 it resonated with me and made me tear up a little .
 it &apos;s profound ,  and simple ,  and beautiful .
 i hope you don &apos;t mind if i use your words in future conversations .
 i &apos;ve thought about it ,  my parents however paid for my advanced directive ,  so at that time with them sitting at the table ,  it was organ donation ,  which i am totally for ,  don &apos;t get me wrong !
 but as a health professional (though i personally didn &apos;t have to dissect) i think it would be awesome to donate .
 which is the appropriate response .
 swallow a gopro before you die .
 since no one knows what happens after death ,  maybe you can be a ghost and watch your dissection .
 then later make the students piss their pants when you fuck with shit around them or make spoopy noises
 holy fuck they stole a real mummy ?
 one of us ,  one of us
 looking at a map it seems most of nova scotia is named after places in the uk .
 they have windsor ,  chester ,  liverpool ,  preston ,  inverness and a trafalgar .
 i know there &apos;s a lot of that in the us but it seems to be a higher density of it here .
 instead ,  you should burn it up ,  get a nice smokey smell and let that smoke go into the sky where it turns into stars !
 i picked the wrong day to give up drinking .
 he has no thumbs .
 not all lions are into incest !
 what the fuck is this animal farm shit ?
 no good until it &apos;s been treated .
 what of old righty ?
 surely he’d be missed ?
 ah ,  another fan of bobby  &apos;where the hell did my database go ?
 a  &apos;change of heart &apos; if you will 
 get your windscreens checked too ,  they can get cloudy and then it &apos;s hard to see ,  and if there &apos;s high pressure behind them it can be dangerous .
 also sometimes you &apos;ll find out the thickness was totally wrong and all the light wasn &apos;t focusing right; you wouldn &apos;t even know everything looked blurry until after you &apos;ve had it fixed ,  then the difference is night and day !
 i &apos;d say it &apos;s totally worth the extra cost ,  you do need a specialist called an  &apos;optician &apos; but sometimes you can get it on your insurance .
 i check my blinking fluids every night when it leaks down my cheeks as i sleep alone in a bed bought for two .
 doesn &apos;t work when it &apos;s dirty on purpose .
 everyone needs photo id yeah ?
  most countries have some type of alternative to drivers licenses for id purposes .
 that &apos;s not a lady ,  it &apos;s bart christian ,  a very fat and racist comic .
 just as i suspected 
 cause of death: choked on gopro
 prolly a mummified chicken or something i did that in my middle school it just mostly takes some time and a shit ton of salt
 that doesn &apos;t sound right ,  but i don &apos;t know enough about stars to refute it
 looks like i picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue .
 that tongue tho !
 i am really proud of this community right now .
 i &apos;m mad at how hard this made me laugh .
 not my dog ,  he &apos;s on a strict vegan diet .
 they’re a package deal .
 both must go to the same person .
 got a partial brain transplant done recently .
 a little piece of mind .
 looks like it &apos;s a water bed now !
 so those aren &apos;t tits .
 i &apos;m increasingly worried .
 precisely as i presumed
 thank god we all have lungs to take that breath with ,  right guys ?
 i &apos;m glad it landed with people
 even if the man receiving them only needs 1 testicle ,  he &apos;s about to have 3 .
 that &apos;s not how it goes in my fantasy ,  it &apos;s usually a more explosive finish .
 you &apos;ve ruined my immersion !
 serious question: can you actually transplant a testicle ?
 wouldn &apos;t that make someone else &apos;s baby juice ?
 not sure if it is technically a pun ,  but it was definitely perfect timing for the usage of the word package .
 had a double amputation last year ,  cost me an arm and a leg .
 this thread is now over ,  we &apos;ve found a winner .
 exactly as i imagined
 in sweden ,  we celebrate christmas for 20 days which results in us celebrating the end of christmas on the 13th of january .
 up until then ,  you’re supposed to keep the christmas decorations up .
 i used to work as an assistant to people with various mental challenges ,  this one guy kept his decorations up 365 days a year .
 nothing like chilling in the living room in july and there &apos;s a fully lighted and decorated christmas tree standing there
 the tree actually looks really nice where it is .
 we might just move it to a corner and take the decorations off of it
 santa lives in my house ,  he makes baseball bats for the kids ,  i wouldn’t want to offend him .
 my mother in law actually hasn’t taken them down since christmas 2019 .
 at this stage my ears have become pointed and i’ve actually lost some height .
 christmas hasn &apos;t arrived for us yet .
 so jokes on you .
 i never got around to taking them down .
 you’re supposed to leave your tree up until epiphany .
  there are twelve days of christmas .
  today is day number two .
 it &apos;s still christmas in my country we have 2 days
 figured i &apos;d save myself the time and just leave them up .
 plus the lights are pretty .
 supposed to take everything down on  &apos;3 kings day &apos; which iirc is jan 7th .
 i keep the twelve days of christmas ,  personally !
 cuz its 12 days of christmas !
 to us ,  christmas really ends when the three mages show up ,  so the 6th of january .
 also st stephen or smth
 weather glitched up and now seasons are undefined
 damn ,  dad ,  that joke was much funnier in 1983 .
 the 12 days of christmas start on the 25th .
 how does this shit get so many awards every year ?
 the twelve days of christmas actually starts on christmas day which means it wouldn &apos;t end until the 5th of january .
 god i hate reddit
 jokes on you its 2nd christmas day here .
 what are you talking about it &apos;s second christmas day today
 we adopted a kitten and she seems to like the christmas decor so we might just leave them .
 gotta be prepared in case those godless communists try to cancel christmas ,  i &apos;m ready to stun them with my 250 , 000 light multi-media extravaganza pious tribute to the savior .
  a bulb burned out .
 the christmas season ends on jan 9 ,  2021 before the feast of jesus’ baptism .
 that’s 16 days of christmas total ,  and i’m getting my money’s worth .
 they &apos;ve already been up for 750 days ,  what &apos;s another year on the pile ?
 it goes for a minimum of 12 days .
 you know the song ?
 this is the most unfunny and overrated post ever
 we &apos;re still on the second day of christmas .
 tomorrow is the third day .
 it is still christmas for eleven more days .
 goodness ,  this sub is so lame now .
 all it is now is a place for people to peddle their qwerky questions but mask it as they &apos;re actually asking a question for discussion .
 op doesn &apos;t give a shit about answers .
 he &apos;s just refreshing the page every 5 seconds ,  masturbating to the attention he &apos;s getting .
 op ,  why do you need the validation of strangers to feel good ?
 where &apos;s your confidence and self-esteem ?
 go find that instead of shitposting on reddit .
 anything that brings me joy during quarantine stays
 i &apos;m not taking them down because i work in a hospital so i didn &apos;t get to see my family or get to do anything except cry and be depressed and get worked to death while everyone is out traveling to see their families without masks ,  while my own covid positive father has been laying in a hospital bed for a month .
 therefore ,  the holidays didn &apos;t exist for me this year .
 why deny the little joy it brings me when i can have a year round tree lamp to stare at after learning how many people died today .
 my lights are staying up and my fake tree is my new reading lamp .
 i deserve 365 more days of light to guide me through this clusterfuck of hell people have created because they can &apos;t bear to stay the fuck home or do something as simple as wear a mask .
 so funny and original !
 in my house christmas lasts until new years eve
 i just wanna know why this managed to get upvoted
 wait you guys aren &apos;t preparing for christmas 2024 yet ?
 it &apos;s still the second christmas day ,  in germany we celebrate the 25th and 26th but open presents on the 24th
 it is still christmas until the epiphany - the 6th of january .
 i figure if my neighbor can fly trump flags and have trump signs in the ground ,  why not christmas decorations .
 given this year it is very bild of you to assume there are 364 days left .
 i &apos;m too busy playing with my new toys .
 its only the 2nd day of christmas ,  we get 12 .
 you’re supposed to leave it up until the epiphany .
 it’s only the 2nd day of the 12 days of christmas ,  ya filthy heathen !
 there are 12 days of christmas that begin on dec .
 christmastide (as the 12 days are known) ends with three kings day on jan .
 the tree stays up til then or til candlemas feb .
 1st according to some traditions .
 either way ,  it &apos;s up now because it &apos;s still christmas .
 the real question is why yours are not up .
  you mean old cotton-headed ninny muggins .
 one less thing to worry about
 because ed asner said it was time to start preparing for next christmas .
 boy scouts are always prepared
 do you really think i &apos;m the kind of person to take them down ?
 i haven &apos;t even showered since last year .
 the same reason that the clock in my car is still an hour fast- it &apos;ll change again soon so theres no point now
 didn’t put any up ,  jokes on you
 it &apos;s bad luck to take them down before  epiphany .
   it &apos;s right there in the nicene confession .
 seriously:  i had a neighbor who believed this .
   i assumed it &apos;s an ethnic thing but i didn &apos;t ask .
 it’s only the second day of christmas ,  decorations stay up until epiphany on january 6th in this house .
 on the 364th day of christmas ,  my true love gave to me .
 as someone who just ordered 1800 bucks of rgb pixel lights i can &apos;t wait .
 christmas is twelve days .
 there’s a little-known song about it .
 christmas spirit and a lack of self control
 i kept mine up form late year .
 just keep adding decorations u til i can &apos;t see my floor anymore !
 does the op think hes funny ?
 my christmas decorations are great for new years too .
 plus ,  ny family takes them down on three kings day (january 6th) .
 in norway we take down christmas decorations on the 13th day usually
 it &apos;s the 12 days of christmas
 it seems just like yesterday
 not sure if this is a joke post .
 who the fuck takes their decorations down the day after christmas ?
 i’m was just too lazy to take mine down after last christmas
 take my up-vote an get out ,  ya filthy animal .
 my illuminated christmas otter stays up until the twelfth day of christmas ,  january 6th .
 it is known as the epiphany ,  this when the three wise men showed up .
 this is also the first night of carnival ,  my mardi gras flag goes up that night .
 still eleven days of christmas left !
 cause we are only in day 2/12 of christmas .
  i am waiting for those wise guys before i take mine down ;)
 i actually put mine up 729 days in advance .
 i &apos;m getting a head start on christmas 2022
 because christmas isn &apos;t over yet !
 it &apos;s  &apos;tweede kerstdag &apos; (second christmas day) !
 hard to argue with this post
 the 12th day of christmas is january 5th .
  so a better question would be ,  why are they down already ?
 because it &apos;s 194 days until christmas in july .
 by the time we get these all taken down we &apos;ll have to start putting them back up again .
 because i haven &apos;t taken them down yet ?
 christmas doesn &apos;t end on christmas day .
 it &apos;s just the  &apos;first &apos; day according to the 12 days of christmas .
 the actual end is the epiphany ,  which is the 6th january .
 i used to live in an apartment with terrible lighting .
 i kept the christmas tree up all year so i could see .
 fuck you take my upvote
 hahahahhaa its so funny guys do you get it you see every one still has all of their decorations up because it has only been one day since christmas .
 but since the holiday only happens once a year on the 25 of december there is almost one entire year until the next christmas so its weird how the everyone is prepared for an event that is so far away .
 tldr: your not funny
 what a shit joke
 put this on a different sub karma whore
 my enneagram is a type 6 and i like to plan and prepare as far ahead of time as possible .
 it &apos;s just my nature .
 because a christmas tree makes an amazing night light when i have to go pee at three in the morning .
 no more stumbling in the dark for me !
 because on the 6th is the day most people open the presents .
 it &apos;s still christmas here ,  we have 2 days of christmas in the netherlands .
 so ,  don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
 i was gifted from an older friend with the biggest heart a cheap led usb tree .
  it’s not awesome looking or even standing straight ,  but i’ve kept that thing on like a night light for over two years now and have no intention of putting it away ever .
 times have gone to shite for the two of us but that tree is one good memory at least up at all times .
 because i &apos;m a lazy piece of shit and leave my christmas stuff up all year .
 i just put stuff over it to mask it but it &apos;s always there waiting on the next one .
 my ladder is trapped under a pile of torn wrapping paper
 because they &apos;ve been up for 3 years now and at this point it &apos;s just the way my lounge looks now .
 my stepbrother has had his xmas lights up in his room since xmas 2019
 if you keep the lights up in the middle of the summer it’s really easy to give directions to your house since it’s the only house with christmas lights up
 don &apos;t be such a grinch
 you ain &apos;t gotta get ready for christmas if you stay ready for christmas .
 may or may not have halloween decorations still up .
 i just paint my tree red for valentines day .
 never too early to celebrate .
 so my father can get pissed off on easter and throw the christmas tree from the unused living room down the stairs ,  just like when i was a kid .
 chill ,  we don’t have to take anything down until new years at my house and decorating for christmas doesn’t start until thanksgiving is over .
 taps head dont have to put em up if you never take em down
 i bought christmas pillows for my couch last year .
 after christmas i thought about taking them off and putting them away in a closet ,  but then i took a nap using one of the pillows .
 it was more comfortable than any of the other pillows i owned ,  so i just left them on my couch the whole year .
 my younger brother is currently in in patient rehab ,  but he  is getting out next week ,  he just turned 18 so we &apos;re going to do a combined christmas and birthday celebration with him !
 for anybody struggling with addiction of any kind ,  know there are people out here to help out ,  even myself .
 happy holidays folks !
 stay healthy and warm .
 galaxy brain here asking the right questions .
 because my wife sure as fuck ain &apos;t taking them down ,  and i didn &apos;t put them there .
 last time we has christmas lights up ,  they were there for 3 years .
 jokes on you ,  my husband takes them down today .
 it &apos;s the weirdest thing i had to get used to .
 but all christmas decorations are gone and put away .
 in the netherlands we celebrate christmas two days
 actually christmas isn &apos;t over .
 it &apos;s just many unaware people are done with it already .
  christmas is celebrated for 12 days (hence the song) up until the epiphany on jan 6 .
  then the overall season officially closes on the sunday after the epiphany .
  so ,  no ,  christmas is very much still going on .
 how is christmas in sweden ?
 i was watching a show and it seems so cozy and everyone gets really into it and participates .
 we celebrate christmas for 20 days ?
 i &apos;ve been missing some shit
 you guys do it right .
 i &apos;m american ,  but had a friend living in sweden for a while .
 the way the whole village seemed to get into celebrations was awesome .
 from afar ,  at least ,  it looks like you guys have an amazing sense of community
 aldrig hört något om detta i mina snart 22 år
 same in slovakia and we build christmas tree on 24th of december so americans with trees from november just seem weird .
 down the street from the house i grew up in ,  there was a neighbor who had their christmas tree lit up and decorated year round .
 we saw it in their window for my whole childhood .
 we used to joke that maybe they were aliens that fell in love with human holidays and each room of their house was dedicated to a different one .
 its called half christmas
 so ,  they only take it down for leap day ?
 i like your username .
 maybe you could teach me a thing or two ?
 that &apos;s a very serious mental condition .
 my roommate and i decided to keep our christmas tree and decorations up as long as we wanted one year .
 only reason it got ratfucked was his new beast of a girlfriend decided ,  even without living with us ,  that it had gone on long enough .
 one day she stayed in while we both left for work .
 she decided it would be “nice” to “clean” the place .
 we made it to july then both our hearts shattered coming home from work that night :( .
 fuck you ,  candice .
 experience christmas like the australians do .
 christmas in july is a thing
 put some heart ornaments on it for valentine’s day !
 then put some eggs on it for easter .
 if it looks nice where it is ,  why move it ?
 there is a million dollar idea here .
 decorations that can be changed to match the season .
 those christmas lights and tree turn into a valentines day decoration !
 my family does this on our tree .
 we are not lazy were smart
 does your fil have a jolly white beard ?
 you’ve become a midget vulcan ?
 live long and prosper .
 haha i have my artificial tree up since last year as well !
 i still have the same large ears as ever but my 5 year old beard does get longer and whiter ,  even if by one hair at a time .
 we took our tree down in july this year .
 are you in hell ?
 people look at me like i &apos;m foreign when i tell em my xmas is january 7th .
 but they dont have to look at me like that
 7th january christmas gang ?
 i never got around to putting mine up
 which marks the end of the 12 days of christmas !
 and thus an angel did appear ,  and it said unto me “bro ,  shit’s over .
 no more colour till valentine’s day”
 yeah my grandma’s nativity scene was set up so the three wise men were traveling somewhere in the house ,  on christmas they’d start heading towards the nativity scene where baby jesus had finally appeared on christmas .
 the three kings would arrive on jan 6th ,  and the nativity scene was finally complete .
 enjoy the scene for a week or so .
 can’t believe i have to scroll this far for this answer .
 in most catholic traditions ,  epiphany is a bigger holiday than christmas
 yeah ,  in mexico we call it three kings &apos; day and we get also presents that day ,  lol .
 it &apos;s silly people posting trees here since november and then they take them down on 27th ?
 christmas just started .
 i keep having to explain to people that the 12 days start on christmas ,  not end on it .
 i once had a neighbor who left their lights up for 2 years straight .
 and in much of the christian world ,  the last day (epiphany ,  or three kings &apos; day) is actually a larger holiday than the first .
 for example ,  in spain and much of latin america ,  january 6 is the day when children wake up to find gifts in their home ,  or a lump of coal if they &apos;ve been naughty .
 and here i am thinking im crazy sitting here with my turtle doves
 so “christmas” ends on jan 5th ?
 there are 12 months of christmas; january is month one
 tweede kerstdag makker
 and we used to celebrate third as well ,  when we were still allowed to get together with big groups of friends !
 (alright ,  that &apos;s probably happening in like ,  july ,  next year .
 makes the neighborhood lit ,  filled with joy !
 there could be a market for this .
  multi-coloured ,  programmable ,  selectable .
 christmas ,  all the colours .
 valentines ,  all red .
  what colour is a turkey anyways ,  .
 every other normal day just plain white
 i &apos;ve been barred from complaining about decorations until after the 6th because of this .
 but there &apos;s always something still up to complain about on the 7th .
 and a little drummer kid .
 given the pandemic ,  time may also soon become undefined as well .
 it &apos;s been getting funnier and funnier every year since the first time i heard it in  &apos;07 .
 please ,  hurry up december 26th so i can hear it again !
 that and the nsync  &apos;it &apos;s gonna be may &apos; meme for late april .
 i need to bust a gut again .
  &apos;on the first day of christmas &apos; should be a dead giveaway on that .
 because people are corny af
 i also hate the way op phrased the question .
 how does this question have six awards already ?
 people who hate reddit and yet use it ,  why ?
 did u know christmas day is the 1st of the 12 days ?
 people will do anything for their pets .
 catholic high five !
 imo its still better than the  &apos;sex sexers of reddit ,  whats the sexiest sex you have ever sexed in sex ?
 i like this answer
 thank you for what you do
 millions of us did not see our families this year ,  because we know it &apos;s a stupid thing to do during a pandemic .
 thank you from the bottom of our hearts for what you are doing .
 it means the world .
 you do deserve that light .
 the way people have behaved is beyond comprehension ,  and i &apos;ve seen my family members who work in medicine almost lose hope .
 you and every other hospital worker out there deserve all of the joy and gratitude in the world after dealing with such an infuriating ,  shitty year .
 thank you for everything that you do .
 can’t believe i had to scroll this far to see this comment .
  it’s always been my family’s tradition to leave the decorations up until new years day ,  allowing us to enjoy both festivities .
  i feel this is pretty common .
 bc reddit is full of fucking idiots
 you should be aware that the 25th is the first day of christmas .
 do keep it up for 11 more days .
 you wouldn &apos;t want to touch me with a 39 .
 also fun fact - epiphany celebrates when the wise men came over to visit jesus so like every navity play you &apos;ve been forced to sit through or act in is wrong
 the dates for the many winter cultural celebrations throughout time are varied .
 even different christian sect celebrate different saints or occasions during this period .
 let us not use  &apos;officially &apos; ,  as there is no governing body .
 and we swedes continues on another seven days ,  before s:t knut (who got murdered) when we have the final christmas party and robs the spruce .
 my mom used to call it  &apos;little christmas ,  &apos; not sure if that &apos;s actually a thing but the tree stayed up until the 6th .
 they celebrate christmas for 20 days .
 it &apos;s great ,  but it comes in a flat box and you have to assemble it yourself .
 a lot of cozy lighting (lights ,  candles ,  etc) to counteract our near-constant dark .
 we all stop what we are doing at 3-4 pm on christmas eve and watch old classic disney cartoons .
 christmas eve is the big day here ,  christmas day is just a day to relax and eat leftovers .
 traditional christmas food is a huge buffet spread that contains (but is not limited to) meatballs ,  various sausages ,  turkey or lamb ,  pickled fish ,  various dressings and condiments ,  potatoes au gratin ,  janssons frestelse (potatoes au gratin with sardines at the bottom ,  because why not i guess) ,  etc the food lasts for days .
 we do advent calendars for the kids (usually with chocolate or other small treats) and light candles every advent sunday leading up to christmas .
 we also celebrate saint lucia’s day on dec 13th each year with a traditional concert .
 check out r/sweden for info on lucia 
 #de som inte kollar på kalle anka ska avrättas
 in sweden its a christmas tradition to watch donald duck !
 as a swede who lived in the us for 10 years i think a big factor in swedish christmases is that we don &apos;t celebrate thanksgiving .
 christmas in sweden is like a combination of us thanksgiving and christmas ,  and getting to spend time with your family and share a great meal together is extremely important .
 second is that we &apos;re a secular country .
 the celebration of the birth of christ ,  while present ,  is taking a backseat to adhering to other christmas traditions .
 where i &apos;ve heard americans discussing new ways to celebrate each year ,  swedes are very much looking forward to do what &apos;s _traditional_ .
 each family &apos;s traditions vary somewhat .
 some of the traditions have pagan roots ,  some christian ,  and some just evolved within the family .
 sidenote: a surprising amount of the traditions are tv shows .
 likely partially due to sweden only having two tv channels for a long time and _everyone_ was watching the same shows .
 i haven &apos;t seen the numbers for this year yet but roughly 40% of all swedes are watching the disney holiday special that &apos;s airing at 3pm every christmas eve since 1960 .
 even if that is lower than it used to be it &apos;s still a crazy number .
 christmas ,  the holiday itself ,  is also very secular .
 it was celebrated long before sweden became a christian country and it doesn &apos;t even have  &apos;christ &apos; in its name as we kept the pagan name for it .
 which means no one is excluded based on their religion .
 third is that we &apos;re starved of light at this time of year .
 that &apos;s not unique to sweden of course ,  but definitely a factor .
 driving home today (first christmas in sweden in 10 years) me and my wife were discussing how every house has christmas lights or at least a bright christmas star or electric candles in the windows .
 every single one .
 colors are more muted compared to the us blinking color explosions ,  but every household is doing their part in this ongoing war with eternal darkness .
 tjugondag knut dansas julen ut .
 we all used to have more .
 remember the song 12 days of christmas ?
 well now we just have 2 .
 christmas day and boxing day .
 i know that i can &apos;t speak for everyone ,  but among my family and friends ,  it seems like time slows down a day or two before christmas as people enters into a christmas mood (without it getting cheesy like the american christmas movies we &apos;re bombarded with these days) .
 and it &apos;s not so much that you have to do certain things or be in a certain way ,  but just .
 to slow things down and be .
 to be perfectly fair ,  it might also have something to do with how we treat relations ,  combined with sweden being an old country far up in the cold and dark north .
 outsiders tend to say that it &apos;s hard to become friends with swedes ,  but once you &apos;ve got to know some of us ,  it &apos;s something special .
 we stick together ,  as we &apos;ve always have had to ,  or we freeze to death .
 which includes the darkest days of the year such as christmas ,  as well as how we light it up with adventsljusstakar and stars :)
 well the rest of the year they stay so far away from each other that it is that much more special for them in the xmas season
 a very merry un-christmas tooo youuuuuu !
 i call it christmas in july
 we had one yes ,  but what about second christmas ?
 yes that &apos;s when the christmas tree cleaner comes over and does a deep cleanse
 yeah you don &apos;t want to mess around with chronic merryzophrenia
 trees for christmas !
 trees for seasons !
 trees inside for all the reasons !
 trees for fetes and fairs ,  vacations ,    .
 party nights in all the nations !
 have them sooner !
 have them later !
 be a festive innovator !
 lose yourself to merry meetings ,    .
 happy moments ,  season &apos;s greetings !
 deck the tree with decorations   .
 made for all the celebrations   .
 any time in any weather !
 what are you doing stuck in the corner houseplant ?
 my sister does this .
 she has a  &apos;christmas &apos; tree in her hair salon that she redecorates every month or so .
 i think last time i was there ,  it had school supplies on it .
 when i was a kid ,  the tree would never come down before easter .
 if i had to guess it was because you could fit one average sized human up the ladder to the attic ,  so wrangling boxes and pieces of a fake tree was something nobody wanted to do .
 this meant come easter morning we’d go to grandma’s to look for eggs and there’d always be a couple in the tree .
 edited for context ,  forgot to add attic .
 i have a friend who does this .
 plus plastic pumpkins for halloween and red white and blue stuff for the 4th of july
 i have a skull planter in my desk at work with a santa hat on it .
 soon i &apos;ll be changing it to a new year &apos;a party hat with maybe a noisemaker .
 we did this with my grandma’s fake tree !
  my little cousins and i redecorated it for every major holiday .
 only lasted a year before my grandma got sick of looking at the same tree in her living room lol .
 i grew up in nova scotia and we could have pretty long winters .
 we had something similar like this .
 we made a giant snowman out front in december .
 fortified it with water so it would freeze .
 we had him hold a sign that said happy ny .
 and then my dad cut the sign into a heart and it said happy valentines .
 and then the snowman was still there with a green hat for st .
 and then the snowman got bunny ears for easter in april .
 i think he finally met his maker mid-may .
 he did his duty .
 i think it’s a cool idea but it might take away the novelty of it during certain seasons
 i have phillips hue light fixtures that allow me to adjust the colors for each holiday .
 this year i didn &apos;t even have christmas lights ,  i just set all of my hue bulbs to be red and green .
 bit of a stretch but ,  what would they turn into before 4th of july ?
 2021 is the best year to make it a real holiday ,  to make up for 2020 .
 what about president &apos;s day ?
 if you can find a small james k .
 polk ornament to hang from a tree ,  pm me ,  stat .
 not a portrait ,  not a polk head .
 a small james polk ornament .
 i will reward you handsomely .
 they already match the seasons .
 when it &apos;s christmas time i turn them on and when it &apos;s not i turn them off .
 for diyers there are pixel lights and controllers .
 there are more and more companies doing permanent accent lighting now .
 i &apos;m going to do one or the other here in the near future .
 already have wife approval to contract it out ,  which would make her happy so i &apos;m not on a ladder .
 that’s what my theo chem teacher does ,  she was just too busy to take the tree down so now she decorates it for each holiday
 i &apos;ve been seriously thinking about wrapping the outlines of the house with rgbw strips so i can just change the colors to wherever the season is and never have to take them down .
 i had this idea .
 i have a white christmas tree about 4ft tall i keep up in my room ,  and for each holiday i just put up colored lights that match the associated colors of that specific holiday .
 neighbor does this .
 lights are white at christmas ,  then red around valentine &apos;s
 the rgb leds on my city library do exactly that .
 every other time of year ?
 standard safety & accent lighting .
 everyone would get real tired of lights if everyone had that lol .
 also damage to them before next christmas is inevitable ,  either due to weather or something else .
 i did that to a tree once .
 it made it all the way till the 4th of july .
 my house was the perfect environment to basically mummify it .
 when i took off the american flags the needles finally just all fell off .
 it became a staple of my apartment and all my friends got involved with it .
 i miss my 20’s .
 you could do stupid shit and not feel like an absolute idiot about it .
 our neighbors did that to us one year .
 we still had our tree up in february (fake tree ,  not a big dead tree that would be unsafe) .
 our families were close and they had a key to our house and so they went in while we were out and decorated our tree with valentines cards and candy .
 i remember my friends family one year didnt feel like taking their tree down one year ,  then just decorated it throughout the year lolol like putting flags in it for the 4th ,  pastel ribben for easter ,  etc
 i did that with led stripes .
 use them as mood lights off seasons .
 it was actually pretty cheap all things considered .
 all i have to do is do the physical props and window stickers etc .
 but i &apos;ve only put up lights once .
 i &apos;m actually in the process of doing exactly this !
 i have individually controllable rgb leds with an arduino that i &apos;ll be connecting to the internet .
 it &apos;ll check the current day whenever it starts up and if it &apos;s within so many days of pre-programmed holidays it will turn on the leds with themes to match the holidays
 michael’s started selling halloween trees this year .
 it’s a christmas tree ,  but black .
 i get into this problem every year .
 after i take down the xmas tree it looks bare in the house .
 so then i google fake trees (something pretty and branched ,  that could be kept year round in a pot as nice decor and changed with the seasons) .
 every year i end up with the same problem .
 once you start down that rabbit hole of looking for a nice fake branched tree you end up in two places .
 cheap birch trees that look like utter crap and are a crime to even sell but are affordable or 2 .
 restoration hardware style overpriced as fuck fake birch trees that look passable as fake trees .
 every year i just give up ,  get angry go eat what &apos;s left of the christmas cookies out of frustration .
 stupid fake ass trees .
 the fake tree i bought this year actually has valentine’s day ,  july fourth ,  and halloween modes so you can keep it up year round
 he does actually but has refused to play santa for our son .
 my wife and mil will be destroying him soon i imagine
 the helium will find you ,  spock .
 he might be russian or something else since i know russia and other places are have it in january
 no ,  close though ,  russia
 i get around round round ,  from town to town .
 i want this version .
 bunch of heathens in this thread
 cue my cursed birthday on three kings day ,  my birthday and christmas presents were always combined gifts .
 whenever i tell non mexican friends they don’t get it .
 we always got tubs of popcorn on this day .
 it &apos;s like second xmas but with snacks .
 to give some context before the victorians cleaned up christmas ,  the 12 days were spent getting drunk or as wikipedia calls it ‘continuous feasting and merrymaking’ .
 obviously 12 days of your workers getting drunk ,  partying ,  fighting etc wasn’t good for production during the early industrial revolution ,  so christmas turned into the one day family holiday we know today .
 we serfs need to take back control from our overlords and spend the next 12 days getting as fucked up as possible !
 you traditionally wait until the feast of the epiphany to remove your xmas decorations .
 which is the 12th day of christmas .
 sorry 13th day .
 you either take decorations down epiphany eve or wait until candlemas .
 people still don &apos;t get that ?
  &apos;on the first day of christmas &apos; should be a dead giveaway that the 12 days start on christmas itself .
 and that &apos;s just christmas .
 i gotta tell em about advent ,  epiphany ,  candlemas ,  etc .
 in my student dorm ,  the light in the kitchen broke once .
 so we just put up 2 strings of christmas lights as replacement .
 they were still there when i left 3 years later .
 who takes their lights down on dec 25 ?
  everyone leaves them on at least until new years or epiphany .
  &apos;on the second year of christmas ,  my true love said to me .
 why the fuck have you still got your decorations up ?
 my family is going on probably 12 years ,  the originals don’t work anymore .
 instead of taking them down and replacing them they just strung up some more on top probably 3 years ago .
 once i get around to it ,  the lights i would like to do on the exterior of my house will never come down .
 they &apos;ll also be hidden so you &apos;ll never know they are there when they aren &apos;t on .
 there is a house 5 mins from me that has christmas lights on all year round for almost 10 years now .
 maybe even longer
 that actually makes way more sense ,  because that &apos;s the day when the three wise men gave jesus his gifts
 in mexico we actually get presents on both days
 it &apos;s a surprising amount of birds .
 christmas season is officially from christmas day until epiphany .
 at least in the christian version of the holiday .
 in the capitalist version the christmas season is nov 1st to dec 26th .
 the 5th is the last day ,  it ends on the 6th .
 5th ,  best i can do
 play your hardest drum and bass to celebrate his legacy .
 what about may the 4th be with you ?
 i haven’t seen that one before .
 can’t wait til april !
 it gets funnier every year .
 pinnacle of comedy this joke is .
 just wait till jan 1st ,  a real funny joke will get hundreds of awards about holding on to stuff from last year .
 this website has some of the funniest people to ever exist .
 because everytime i close the app i &apos;m looking at it again in 5 seconds without realizing it .
 because we &apos;re optimistic and still hope that someday people will stop clogging it with endless reposts of the same jokes .
 because of lame ass people who think they’re clever ,  like you
 they don &apos;t actually hate reddit ,  that &apos;s hyperbole .
 they dislike the people posting shitty jokes that make no sense and are phrased poorly ,  at best .
 how the fuck would anyone have decorations up  &apos;already &apos; when christmas was yesterday for most people ?
 you &apos;d have to take them down to have them up already .
 for fuck &apos;s sake !
 not just that ,  it &apos;s like telling a clerk ,   &apos;i guess it &apos;s free then !
  &apos; when an item isn &apos;t ringing up .
 some of us just don &apos;t like your lazy shit joke that is clearly just a gross attempt for internet points .
 it &apos;s sad ,  but it &apos;s also really annoying .
 you are contributing to the collective groan that has become  &apos;askreddit &apos; .
 you should know that i downvoted your post but i upvoted this comment ,  you snarky ass .
 well ,  at least those poor souls are surreptitiously seeking actual advice to better themselves .
 posts like these are from people that got boo &apos;d at open mic and need some sort of ascertation that they &apos;re not completely pointless in life .
 but ,  yea ,  i agree with you ,  the sex posts are far too often .
 this is just my add talking .
 but very curious about your username .
 we healthcare workers appreciate your kind words .
 wishing you and your family good health and infinite blessings .
  god bless you and your family for the sacrifices they have made and may you never have to endure the pain of any loss .
  thank you for taking the time to reply to this .
 but that’s the point ,  it feels like twelve days by the time you’re to the wise men !
 see ,  it’s totally factual !
 well ,  to be accurate you would have to sit there for at least 2 years .
 jesus was not a baby by the time they got to him .
 so you &apos;re saying that my snowman costume that i wore in kindergarten wasn &apos;t an accurate representation of the events surrounding the birth of christ ?
 except the wise men came years later ,  not within weeks .
 i mean ,  christ (if at all) was certainly not born in december anyway .
 then they can take the decorations down
 thank you ,  i needed that .
 and the instructions for assembly sometimes aren’t included .
 this all sounds lovely and i wish i can one day experience that .
 you made me miss sweden even more .
 haven &apos;t seen my family in 1 .
 5 years because of the pandemic .
 i tried to recreate it best as i could here in the u .
 but it &apos;s not the same ,  especially when i can &apos;t be there with my family .
 christmas eve is the big day here ,  christmas day is just a day to relax and eat leftovers .
 same in latinoamerica .
 the 24th is the big day where we gorge ourselves in sanguches de miga and watch the crónica tv countdown
 don’t forget the julskinka
 i love reading how everyone there celebrates christmas !
 i definitely don’t have 1/10th of the fun celebrating christmas here !
 flyttat till andra sidan jorden och min ej svensk talande son vill inte se titta på kalle ankas jul : &apos;(
 missade det för första gången i år pga konstig sömncykel .
 trodde det skulle finnas kvar på svt play en stund men tydligen inte tack vare dumma rättigheter och sånt .
 and then ,  not long after you can start that all over again for orthodox christmas !
 imagine the size of your shits after all them feasts .
 tuomas joulun tuopi ,  paha nuutti pois sen viepi .
 god jul från suomi .
 we gear up for christmas during the four sundays before the big day ,  have our main christmas celebration on christmas eve ,  party with friends on christmas day and hang with our extended family on boxing day .
 then you have a set of chill days before new year’s eve and keep christmas coziness as the year begins .
 on the 13th of january ,  we have “tjugondag knut” (twentieth day knut) which ends the christmas celebrations and the christmas decorations is to be taken down including us robbing the christmas tree from sweets .
 one of my goals is to take my little one to places like sweden during christmas celebration .
 i haven’t gone ,  but i definitely imagine there’s something magical there during christmas time .
 some people in australia actually have christmas in july so that they can celebrate it in the winter
 think you got confused with tinselitus .
 the sproggiest poem i &apos;ve ever read !
 i &apos;m glad timmy isn &apos;t in this one ,  lol .
 the freshest sprog i &apos;ve ever been privy to !
 nobody puts houseplant in the corner !
 i never knew my real plant
 what are you doing steptree ?
 houseplant i &apos;m stuck ,  what are you doing ?
 naughty foliage must go to the shame corner
 i &apos;m just picturing her carelessly tossing bic pens & high lighters on the tree .
 thats actually pretty cool
 i made my first pumpkin tree  this fall .
 it was beautiful 
 in norway we have a saying(originally from a song) that christmas lasts until easter :)
 i got a prelit black christmas tree from pier 1 on clearance for 90% off .
 i deck it out for halloween with halloween ornaments .
 it looks awesome .
 it was 16c here in nb yesterday
  &apos;happy new york .
 every neighborhood would be like a mini vegas strip
 given that my girlfriend &apos;s apartment has about 12 different lighting systems in just the living room alone i don &apos;t think the novelty can be killed
 just sell colour changing leds ,  and you can change the colour to match the season .
 seems expensive to deck out an entire house in hue bulbs .
 red white and blue ,  duh
 red white blue for 4th ,  orange and purple for hween ,  etc
 halloween in january ,  obviously
 red white and blue lights obviously .
 just put diffuser strips over top of them ,  then they &apos;ll be basically invisible when the lights are off ,  so you don &apos;t even need to come up with seasonal designs ,  just leave them off most of the year .
 he &apos;s sitting on gold and squandering it
 the eastern orthodox church has their christmas 2 weeks after the usual date of 25th december ,  as they celebrate it as they would on the julian calendar .
 you know the twelve days of christmas ?
 december 25 is the first one .
 january 6 is the 12th day when the three kings arrived with gifts for baby jesus .
 a lot of more traditional/orthodox christians will have their main celebration on this day .
 you mean ,  orthodox ,  right ?
 we celebrate it on 7th of january
 i &apos;m a real cool head , 
 the gen z bible translation on insta is pretty close and pretty hilarious !
 further evidence of capitalism ruining everything is touches .
 i like this ,  let &apos;s do it !
 are you volunteering as lord of misrule ?
 epiphany is 13 days after christmas day (it &apos;s january 6th) .
 you get a full 12 days of christmas (and 12th night is a time to get drunk)
 it gets confusing with advent calendars which start before christmas
 i always assumed the 25th was the 12th day
 that doesn &apos;t help at all .
 it is ambiguous .
 it fits either interpretation .
 if you already think the twelve days start before ,  it still makes sense .
 christmas extending into the new year is a weird concept to me .
 this is me right now .
 my roommates and i hung up orange lights for halloween ,  they are still up .
 white string lights for thanksgiving ,  they are still up .
 and now we have the multicolored christmas lights ,  i’m not sure if they’ll make the cut- ah yeah i’m too lazy they definitely will .
 i know someone who took them down last night .
 in my head i was thinking ,   &apos;well ,  yeah ,  shannon ,  i &apos;d be sick of your christmas decorations too if i stuck them up in october like a freak .
 instead ,  i refrained from commenting on her post and our friendship will live to see another day .
 life is too short to be needlessly bitchy to someone who simply enjoys holidays differently than i do .
 that said ,  epiphany for the win !
 good for aesthetics ,  i think .
 i bought a silver tinsel tree a couple years ago ,  i had wanted one for years and finally found it .
 that bad boy stayed up in my living room until the next christmas because i was so excited about it
 squirrels chew threw them around my area
 something you shouldn &apos;t do to your true love is saddle them with a boatload of bird poop .
 but hey ,  i hear guano is a profitable business .
 i never realized how many birds until i started a drawing a day for each day .
 so many feathers !
 the christmas season for me lasts from thanksgiving to january 6 .
 ik vergeet altijd dat andere landen geen 2e kerstdag hebben .
 ah cmon it was my late grandmothers
 you must not go on facebook much
 just wake me up when september ends .
 you bloody arrogant idiot lmao
 it is traditional to give to your true love on this day twelve  &apos;drummers drumming &apos; .
 no serious historian questions that christ was an historical figure ,  so you can drop the “if at all” nonsense .
 on the 13th of january .
 i haven’t been able to travel either due to the pandemic and had to miss my dad’s funeral as a result .
 and now for christmas we couldn’t even go see my stepmom (her first christmas alone in nearly 20 years) .
 obligatory psa: everyone stay the fuck home ,  wear a mask if you go outside ,  and get your vaccine when you can .
 we all want to be able to have a normal christmas next year .
 won’t doubt it ,  a lot of traditions were just adapted from older traditions ,  given new meaning and a new coat of paint here and there .
 the christmas season is sometimes referred to as christmastide .
 and don &apos;t forget to water the spruce .
 my advice is to go a bit further north if you want to experience christmas with snow .
 the snow can sometimes take until february before it lands in mid-southern sweden .
 but regardless it &apos;s surely a sight to see the streets lit up when it &apos;s pitch dark at 5 pm
 precisely why we &apos;re gathered here to cheer !
 do people actually do this .
 it’s not like it snows ,  it’s just wet .
 can &apos;t argue with that logic :d
 timmy went out to get a tree .
 he was as happy as can be .
 he cut the tree and to no surprise .
 and then fucking died .
 did you know that sprog rhymes with nog ,  who was a pretty cool ferengi character ,  as far as ferengis go ?
 i think sober lighters are more appropriate for schools
 don’t mind if i do .
 unfortunately ,  i got it home and some of the lights didn’t work .
 but it was so cheap i can’t be mad .
 holy crap ,  that’s almost hot for this time of year !
 just down in ontario ,  i wish it would get that warm .
 with blackjack and hookers ?
 first apartment here most of my guests are just friends who come over and get fucked up .
 at first some interesting light fixtures sounded corny and cheap but now i &apos;m kinda thinking it could help the vibe
 you could probably do it with 3-4 bulbs depending on how wide your house is .
 plus once you have the hub you need to start ,  adding a bulb or two isn’t terrible .
 check out philips wiz ,  $10/each for rgb dimmable bulbs ,  no hub needed .
 i’m going to start calling it hween when i shorthand it much like xmas so thanks for that trendsetter
 i appreciate the effort but i &apos;m essentially looking for a polk figurine ornament .
 it &apos;s really just a very tiny detail ,  because before the gregorian calendar came along the 25th of december was the 6th of january (when we orthodox people celebrate it) .
 it was really just a move to be different from the catholics when they adopted the gregorian calendar .
 and the world ,  i might add .
  meant the seventh of january .
 going covid-crazy here .
 also 3 kings day is jan .
 this is the day the 3 wiseman visited jesus and gave the presents of silver ,  gold ,  and murr .
 i keep my decorations up till the 7th for this reason .
 i know just enough to know i don &apos;t know .
 also its a story from over 2000 years ago .
 no proof it happend ,  or how it happened .
 or to whom it happened .
 jesus could have gotten a sega saturn on his first christmas
 yep ,  january 7th for us .
 fyi ,  i &apos;m not from russia .
 certain eastern orthodox churches
 the 3 wise men shoulda shipped via dhl .
 wouldn &apos;t have taken 12 days .
 i &apos;ve always wondered why there were 12 days of christmas ,  as i didn &apos;t grow up religious at all .
 i always figured the first day was actually 12 days before christmas but ,  again ,  never knew .
 thanks for inadvertently teaching me something new !
 december 25 is the first one .
 january 6 is the 12th day .
 if dec 25 is the first day ,  then jan 6 would be the 13th day .
 december 24th is the first of the twelve days
 many orthodox churches celebrate on december 25 ,  and the coptic celebrate on january 7 .
 it &apos;s about the calendar used and not about whether they &apos;re orthodox or not .
 well ,  siberia is not that hellish in winter
 i’m makin real good bread
 except /r/wallstreetbets of course !
 they ruin their own things .
 and all the 12 days of christmas programming on disney and hallmark and stuff .
 advent and christmas are two different seasons though .
 advent ends on december 24th ,  christmas starts on december 25th .
 there &apos;s no overlap
 which would mean that you &apos;re counting the days of advent ,  right ?
 otherwise they &apos;d call them christmas calendars .
 it is only confusing because most people don &apos;t know the actual christian calendar .
 for as christian as the us claims to be most people know almost nothing about christianity .
 christmas extending into the new year is a weird concept to me .
 i &apos;d think it was only natural ,  since they are proximate to each other .
 my wife and i did a nightmare before christmas themed halloween .
 black christmas tree ,  scary wreathe ,  orange and purple lights in the tree ,  black bouquets instead of pointsettas ,  skull snow globe ,  black taper candles .
 our decorations have been up since september .
 it &apos;s 184 birds if you don &apos;t want to count them out .
 i have to put it in a nice frame and it &apos;s gonna sit on a shelf for a long time .
 i &apos;m taking a risk here .
 i wouldn &apos;t wish going to facebook to my worst enemy
 up until then ,  you &apos;re supposed to keep the christmas decorations up .
 yeah but until then you’re really supposed to keep the decorations up .
 i always thought all of sweden was a snowy country .
 this right here .
 this is what i was looking for .
 what about those friendly hi-lighters ?
 they’re good too
 fellow new brunswicker its snowing and - 2 so it must be winter again .
 on second thought ,  forget the decorations
 my house already has those .
 read all about it !
 fresh sprog found in the wild !
 whatever is so spot on for how i feel about xmas decorations
 hahah they really do add to the vibe ,  especially at night .
 she &apos;s got a few light bars  &apos;hidden &apos; in places like across the back of her desk ,  a shelf ,  behind the sofa which look really cool and glow up walls different colours ,  she &apos;s got two modern looking lava lamps which are sick ,  one of the walls has a row of i think christmas lights (but they look really good ,  i think they &apos;re quite expensive) which all hang down the wall ,  a few programmable colour mood lamps and more !
 honestly you could probably find some cool looking shit for pretty cheap just bombing around ikea
 the colored bulbs are $40 a piece
 yeah that guy is really streets ahead .
 never heard of these either ,  i’m totally stealing it thx my dude u/faladorable
 i bet you could custom order one from etsy .
 they have people who specialize in everything
 you could 3d print one
 my family is russian/russian orthodox ,  and we have fun christmas on the 25th ,  and religious christmas on january 7th .
 it &apos;s so easy getting time off work .
 people have learned to ask me months ahead of time if i &apos;ll work the 24th ,  and new years eve/day cause they don &apos;t mean anything to me .
 but also we know that the date december 25th was chosen to synchronize with the roman holiday of saturnalia .
 and we know jesus wasn &apos;t born in the winter because it mentioned the shepherds were still out in the pasture with their herd ,  which would not happen during the cold months of winter .
 it was really just a move to be different from the catholics .
 the julian calender is the older calender .
 the orthodox church made no  &apos;move &apos; at all in deciding not to  &apos;move &apos; over to the gregorian calendar .
 also ,  the church &apos;s reluctance to follow the civil calendar transition completely fucked up the traditions that people used to have .
 you &apos;re supposed to fast on the new years eve ,  which won &apos;t ever happen ,  and the internal logic of traditions defines the new year &apos;s after the christmas ,  not before ,  which lead to an abomination called the old new year &apos;s day .
 fuck that shit ,  we should just move to the proper christmas date ,  there &apos;s no other way .
 it &apos;s odd considering the western churches (catholic ,  protestant) consider january sixth ,  almost two weeks after jesus &apos;s birth the feast of epiphany when the wise men arrived because of the gregorian calendar .
 yet the eastern churches state january sixth is the date of christ &apos;s birth in the julian calendar .
 so is the feast of epiphany on the 18th of january then in the eastern churches ?
 presents of silver ,  gold ,  and murr .
 gold ,  frankincense ,  and myrrh .
  and the day is more properly known as the feast of the epiphany .
 gold ,  frankincense and myrrh
 yeah ,  we’d have the 400 days of christmas .
 you &apos;re saying hell froze over ?
 it’s probably more hellish in summer when the permafrost melts and the methane bubbles explode .
 i &apos;m gettin &apos; bugged driving up and down the same old strip
 we &apos;ve had one ,  yes .
  but what about second christmas ?
 yes ,  but not everyone knows that and they were just explaining how people get it confused .
 advent and the 12 days of christmas are different ,  but they occur around the same holiday so it &apos;s not crazy that people would confuse it over the years .
 yeah ,  but that &apos;s not how confusion works
 it &apos;s not that odd .
 traditionally on one side of my family that whole week or so was often kind of a delightful continuous  &apos;holiday time &apos; with frequent gathering and eating .
 the next major holiday ,  the calendar year rolling over ,  and people generally going back to work or school seems like a natural end .
 if you want to party another week ,  knock yourself out .
 this is brilliant .
 now just figure out how to get easter in there .
 a couple of crucifixes and you can have a year round installation .
 how is christmas in sweden ?
 up north is definitely snowy .
 but sweden is a very  &apos;long &apos; country so it can differ a lot in temperature depending on where you are .
 southern part of sweden could probably be comparable to uk weather .
 you scared it away !
 but the internet never forgets: .
 lights for christmas !
 lights for seasons !
 lights and trees for all the reasons !
 lights for fetes and fairs ,  vacations ,    .
 party nights in all the nations !
  &apos;have them sooner !
 have them later !
 be a festive innovator !
 lose yourself to merry meetings ,    .
 happy moments ,  season &apos;s greetings !
  &apos;deck the hall with decorations   .
 made for all the celebrations !
 any time in any weather !
 just bought one .
 they used to be cheaper but now they &apos;re running 60 kanuckistan pesos !
 what does  &apos;streets ahead &apos; mean ?
 is it like miles ahead ?
 when i was little i couldn’t say “abraham lincoln” and it came out as “hammy hammy linky” .
 it’s turned into a decades-long family joke .
 so i asked an etsy crafter to make something with just that mispronunciation as a guide and she made the most incredible fucking ornament i’ve ever seen .
 it was a fully and beautifully detailed smoked ham wearing a stovepipe hat and a lincoln beard .
 it was magical .
 and only cost like fifteen bucks !
 it made my mom about die laughing though .
 i think that would be cheating .
 i have that one !
 but i don &apos;t want to drill a hole in the head .
 i thought about putting a noose on it but that &apos;s kind of morbid .
 our christmas is on 6th january ,  but that &apos;s only the religious celebration; we have presents on new year &apos;s eve .
 we don &apos;t live in armenia but my family don &apos;t celebrate the 24th/25th .
 i don &apos;t like the idea of completely treating it as a normal day ,  though ,  considering the rest of the country celebrates something ,  but i also find it sad that for others christmas is over on the 26th and they &apos;ve already binned the tree when to me it &apos;s just the start of 12 days of on and off festivities .
 in russia we celebrate new year the same way the west celebrates christmas ,  with a tree ,  gifts ,   &apos;santa claus &apos; ,  etc .
 it &apos;s one of the biggest holiday of the year .
 and we have 8-9 days off lol .
 your family doesn &apos;t celebrate it tho ,  does it ?
 we call it 3 magic kings back at home in pr which sounds a lot more fun
 for us latin people is the 3 wise men day or 3 magic kings day ,  and the story is more or less what u/joejill told ,  sega saturn and everything 
 thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense ,  er ,  but don &apos;t worry too much about the myrrh next time
 wish me luck ,  today is the day to call that one girl from highschool .
 they celebrate it for 20 days
 if you have to ask ,  you’re streets behind .
 if you have to ask ,  you &apos;re streets behind .
 you should watch community .
 you meticulous bastard .
 can you tie a string around his armpits ?
 like a rescue mission ?
 place inside a transparent case ?
 tie legs/feet to a stick ?
 that &apos;s exactly right .
 we have so much fun with it ,  and have our tree ,  and lights from the 15th of december to the 15th of january .
 the governments decided to use the gregorian calendar ,  not the churches .
 yeah ,  there’s a lot of methane trapped in the permafrost .
 climate change is causing more of it to melt ,  releasing the methane ,  which is why very soon the effects will be irreversible .
 methane is a far stronger greenhouse gas than co2 .
 happy 2021 everyone !
 just search “methane explosions in siberia”
 i’ve heard they engage in festivities for 20 days
 then they can take down the decorations
 or a bondage rope harness !
 that would be a polk in a box ornament ,  not a small polk ornament .
 i need to find somewhere ,  online ,  a small polk to hang on a tree .
 would the stick then be tied to the tree ?
 i thought only my family kept the tree for that long .
 we also put it up quite late in december rather than from the start of the month .
 we have a birthday in the family around that time of january ,  too ,  so the tree has always traditionally stayed up until after then .
 there have been a couple of years where i &apos;ve even kept mine all the way to end of jan but admittedly that was laziness (also it was an artificial tree so no expiry date as such) .
 i currently live in the uk and there &apos;s a superstition here that it &apos;s bad luck to keep the tree up after christmas .
 i always find it odd when i go to someone &apos;s house on nye and they no longer have christmas decorations .
 after which they remove the paraphernalia used for the decorations attributed to the holiday .
 on the 13th of january
 an odd superstition .
 i wonder how it started ?
 there was a post on r/aww of a gorilla using sign language to tell people not to feed it or something to that effect .
 to this day ,  i still laugh when i think about a comment that said ,   &apos;it &apos;s a shame there &apos;s so many deaf gorillas .
 this one guy was on the toilet ,  and he sneezed while he was taking a shit .
 that same moment ,  the power in his house went out .
 he proceeded to cry because he thought he shit himself blind .
 maybe someone can help me find the actual post .
 it was from 5 years ago on a post about what you would do with a specific amount of money (like 5 million dollars in a lottery) .
 someone replied with  &apos;is that enough to rent an orange cat for two years &apos; and it was so far out of left field and hilarious to me that i haven &apos;t stopped thinking about it .
 not a single post but a series by /u/shittymorph making up bogus facts relevant to any particular thread and ending with .
 since 1998 when undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer &apos;s table .
 someone rin r/homeowners trying to get rid of ants in their house .
  tons of comments .
  one fellow redditor suggested maybe there were no ants ,  that they were hallucinations due to carbon monoxide poisoning .
  op had his house tested and turns out there were ,  in fact ,  no ants and he was hallucinating them due to carbon monoxide poisoning .
 i can’t remember everything about the post or even which sub it was in ,  but i think about this one a lot .
 op was staying in a hotel and the person in the room next to them was blasting sesame street .
 they suddenly heard a grown man yell ,  “god dammit mister noodle !
 believe i saw it on reddit ,  a it tech related post .
 guy starts a new job as a system admin ,  no other it at the place ,  previous admin had been there for just about fucking forever and left behind some documentation ,  but not enough to make the job easy .
 the guy finds a note from the previous tech with a few misc tips ,  and then says  &apos;if there is a critical emergency and everything else has failed ,  there is a box in the server room behind the switch ,  open only as a last resort .
 guy is there for a few years ,  metaphorical fires get fixed ,  he learns the tricks of the place ,  but one day the server doesnt boot ,  tries everything ,  cant get it to work ,  all the files are there ,  the company cant function ,  actual fires are about to start .
 guy freaks out and remembers the emergency box and figures now should be an emergency and figures maybe the guy left access info to offsite backups or tape drives or some sort of disaster recovery and goes into the server room .
 behind the switch is a box ,  pulls it out and opens it to find a bottle of tequila .
 i still love the r/showerthoughts post .
 going waterboarding in guantanamo bay sounds like a great time if you don &apos;t know what either of those things are
 i forget the whole thing but something along the lines of a guy had to go to a dinner with his wife’s parents .
 ate some edibles not realizing how strong they were .
 and he was sweating like a pig claiming how spicy the food was .
 then his wife was like “we’ve only had the appetizer bread and water .
 ” i have no idea how to get the link but it had me in tears the first time .
 trust me it’s way funnier than i make it to be .
 this 14yo kid in a nsfw post when asked what he was doing there and he replied  &apos;i don &apos;t go to work &apos;
 there was some discussion in comments about slav squat ,  and someone asked “what is slav ?
 ” and the reply was “baby don’t hurt me ,  don’t hurt me no more” .
 something i will never forget .
 so a while back there was a post i think on r/insanepeoplefacebook of a woman looking for a bus to hold 60 people for a  church function and was so fucking hostile and rude about it in one post she says next and for months on reddit people were always saying next to everything but it seemed nobody besides me remembers this and i cant find the post .
 edit ok so apparently i &apos;m not the only one who remembers this wish it would make a comeback
 the burrito rant !
 a guy ordered a burrito for take out and took it home only to find they had wrapped it sideways .
 he wrote the most amusing angry letter .
 the post where a woman is saying how her husband and fil are prepping for her to die during childbirth even though she and fetus are perfectly healthy .
 they 100% were plotting to kill her and there not being an update has me scared for her .
 aita about the guy who ate 6 feet of sub at a friends party .
 still can’t get over it .
 talking about worse moment in life ,  a mother described the silence she was met with when she came home and saw the shoes of her husband and child ,  and was anticipating hearing their laughter/playing ,  but found them dead in a murder suicide .
 tree bro &apos;s who were speeding to meet an ambulance after a comrade was injured ,  a woman blocked them in and the friend inevitably died .
 the world &apos;s dumbest student .
 i miss kevin &apos;s antics and wish i saved that comment .
 the story of /u/spontaneoush .
 it’s shocking how little it took for him to turn into a full blown heroin addict ,  but the documentation of their spiral was more convincing than any dare program i could’ve thought of .
 there was one that i &apos;ve never been able to find again ,  but some guy insulted somebody and he replied with something like  &apos;says the virgin with the 3 inch penis &apos; and provided links from the other guy &apos;s post history that proved both those assertions .
 it was an absolute burial .
 you love to see it .
 i &apos;m surprised not to see this one .
  a guy peed on a pregnancy test on whim ,  and it came back positive .
   i think he did find out he had testicular cancer ,  and thankfully survived .
 i watched the woody harrelson  &apos;i &apos;m here to talk about rampart &apos; ama debacle happen in real time .
 i think it &apos;s one of the only times i ever actually participated in an ama as it was happening rather than reading the whole thing later .
 it was magical .
 the guy who always worked in being beaten by jumper cables by his father into every comment .
 i’ve been on the toilet for about an hour now and can’t move my legs because of this post
 the man who attempted to throw his steak out the window .
  his wife followed up with her version a little later .
 thanks for the gold and awards :)
 i remember some guy asked reddit what movie really made a impact on their life ,  and some guy said  &apos;paul blart: mall cop &apos; and somehow every post from that point on would end up relating to paul blart .
 even made some leaks into other threads
 a recent one ,  but that 40 something year old guy who bought like ,  5 peleton bikes to give to the family of his 21 year old eastern european wife because they told him it was tradition in their country
 there was a guy on aita that had a son with his ex wife and he moved away and started a new family .
 this man was a mechanic his whole life and with his first son had promised him when he was like 4-6 that he’d get this sweet car they’d worked on .
 instead he gives it to his 16 year old son from the second marriage and his first son was furious .
 like never speaking to you again furious .
 dad was dumbfounded .
 then the son sent him a video where dad promised him the car at his birthday party .
 turns out his first son went to school to be a mechanic like his dad .
 this mfer had never even once asked what his son was doing with his life .
 i’ve never been so sad reading a story on reddit .
 one time on r/relationship_advice some guy posted a thread called    .
 “my (25m) girlfriend 26f baked all the beans ,  now i consider to end our relations ?
 its deleted now though but i still have the full post .
 i discovered this in another one of these askreddit posts but honestly its too good not to put here .
 now without further ado ,  here it is:   .
 my girlfriend and me have done dating for 5 month .
 i thought  &apos;this girl is very good ,  &apos; and became of love with her .
 yet even so ,  on this monday ,  i comed home and found she as baked all my beans .
 in my cupboard i store several bag of bean ,  to make soft and to bake on some days ,  to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner .
 or ,  heck ,  a lunch too some days .
 but on the monday i find this girlfriend baked all the beans .
 i say  &apos;why do you bake my beans &apos; ,  and she say something as  &apos;i bakes them good to save time ,  so i bakes them all now .
 i am astonished and full of dissmay .
 i say  &apos;i canfr not eat all the beans &apos; ,  she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time .
 but ,  if a bean is froze and unfrozed ,  the very good and very nice flavor of bean is gone far .
 a bean is best if baked fresh as a sunday pie .
 not to be froze and unfroze !
 i told my girfriend i am so sad of this ,  as to my opinion the baking of the beans and to freeze them has ruin all my beans .
 she say i am  &apos;gone haywire &apos; by my enragement and sad manners .
 but i hates what she did to my beans .
 on the days before monday i thought  &apos;will we marry the girlfriend ?
 well it might be so .
 but now i am so sad she baked them beans .
 i am consider to end our relations and not be the boyfriend and girlfriend any more .
 but ,  is my idea wrong ?
 could my girlfriend make promise to not bake the beans ?
 i do not know what doing to do and how to feel forgiving on her .
 the og post was  &apos;christians ,  what would you do if you died and instead of jesus it was anubis &apos; .
 best comment ever:  &apos;nice fursuit jeezy boi &apos; .
 ) ,  some redditor got very excited over his 2 am chili and posted an extensive tutorial ,  in full  &apos;fuck yeah bell peppers &apos; style .
 naturally ,  this became a meme .
 concurrently ,  another redditor posted nothing less than the life hack of the century: freeze a block of water ,  squirt shower gel on top ,  freeze that ,  and now you have ice soap (tm) .
 this was a fine enough goof ,  but the op &apos;s insistence that this was much more efficient than putting shower gel on one &apos;s body made it become a meme .
 so what happens when two memes are popular at the same time ?
 someone froze a block of chili and rubbed their body with it .
 and achieved the coveted #1 spot .
 this site is weird like that .
 _sorry no links as i &apos;m on mobile .
 many thanks to whomever is willing to dig them up .
 there was a post a month or so ago about a girl who’s boyfriend kept telling her she smells bad no matter how undeniably good she smelled .
 finally he admitted that he was just telling her she smelled bad to keep her self esteem low enough she wouldn’t leave him .
 then she immediately dumped him .
 the guy who got hit by a car (i think ?
 ) ,  lived an entire life with a wife and kid he loved very much ,  only to wake up on the pavement realizing it was all fake .
 the r/legaladvice saga where the anti-semetic boss and the jewish woman who worked for her both posted separately about the same incident and la put 2 and 2 together
 the poopknife ,  i don &apos;t remember the context ,  but it was fked and i love it
 the man who redirected an entire warship to get the sun off his eyes: .
 i was once on a us military ship ,  having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the operations officer (ops) walks in .
 this guy was the definition of not a morning person; he &apos;s still half asleep ,  bleary eyed .
 basically a zombie with a bagel .
 he sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious .
 my back is to the outboard side of the ship ,  and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face .
 he &apos;s squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today .
 it &apos;s painful to watch .
 but then zombie-ops stops chewing ,  slowly picks up the phone ,  and dials the bridge .
 in his well-known i &apos;m-still-totally-asleep voice ,  he says  &apos;heeeey .
 shift our barpat .
 yeah ,  one six five .
  &apos; and puts the phone down .
 and then he just sits there .
 and then ,  ever so slowly ,  i realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie &apos;s face and onto the wall behind him .
 after a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what i &apos;ve just witnessed begins to overwhelm me .
 by ordering the bridge to adjust the ship &apos;s back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees ,  he &apos;s changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face .
 he &apos;s literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel .
 he slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment i &apos;m terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him ,  that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he &apos;s not going to wake up for another hour) .
 but between his next bites he pauses ,  looks at me ,  and gives me the faintest ,  sly grin ,  before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel .
 i still think about it sometimes .
 some guy in r/unpopularopinion says that wearing socks in the shower feels great .
 ea &apos;s micro-transaction post .
 you like that ,  you fucking retard ?
 i remember one where some guy did some rendering of animation or something for iirc disney and they paid him a bunch of money to basically do nothing but run some program on his computer .
 he then for reddit karma turned a not yet released bit of animation into a meme and disney found out about it and fired him so he ended up having to deliver mail .
 if anyone remembers that one and can find a link please do .
 what happens if you don &apos;t wash coconuts .
 there was a guy (i believe he was a nurse) who wrote about the time he was eating out his girlfriend and she squirted when she came .
 apparently it’s less parts female ejaculation than it is just straight up pee ,  and the op noted it tasted very sweet .
 he asked if she was diabetic .
 he told her to get her blood sugar levels tested and inadvertently saved her life .
 she had undetected diabetes .
 orgasms save lives ,  kids .
 the one where the guy felt violated because he agreed to poop on his gf faces and she tricked him and ate it .
 that pretty girl in roast roastme who got fucking demolished and had to delete her account
 that one time someone said h .
 lovecraft but it got autocorrected to h .
 minecraft and the post was like 500 words long
 the 6 foot sub guy in aita .
 obligatory thanks for the award kind stranger !
 /u/chris_courtland being the source mvp on this very post
 there was an askreddit about which fictional character would be worst in bed .
 best answer was jar jar binks and the first comment under his name was meesa cumming
 the guy who ate part of his own amputated foot has always been a favorite of mine .
 the dagobah story is still one of the best
 the one where the guy jerked off to pics of his sister in law ,  then his wife found out and took over the post and locked him out of his account and divorced him .
 the fucking safe .
 that kid who faked cancer
  &apos;are you fucking sorry ?
 i can &apos;t remember where this was posted but this woman had downloaded a sleep app that used audio recording in her sleep .
 when she woke up and reviewed the recording ,  you can hear her talking in her sleep and she asks a question like  &apos;what are you doing ?
 and all you hear is a bunch of muffled noise and a response which was like  &apos;go back to sleep &apos; or something like that .
 op was trying to help figure out if it was a home invasion or something else .
 the entire recording is very creepy as is the situation involved .
 i wish i could remember where it was ,  but i think about it all the time and now i don &apos;t want to record my sleep .
 seeing all these comments makes me realize how much i missed
 the guy who was on his computer ,  wearing headphones ,  he thought he heard something so he took his headphones off ,  heard screaming and discovered his wife was being raped in the next room over ,  toddler daughter was present and being told she was next by the rapist .
 i think he said he could never wear headphones/ear buds or anything after that ,  and his wife never entered that house again .
 they bought a new house and .
 moved shortly after .
 really heartbreaking story for that whole family .
 two words: tom cruise .
 it was an ass credit that asked  &apos;what celebrity do you think is secretly gay ?
  &apos; first thing that popped into my head was tom cruise so i click to add my obviously superior answer to the post and my jaw just dropped .
 was tom cruise .
 i lost my shit at that one .
 i just kept scrolling to the point that the words tom and cruise stopped making sense .
 it was a glorious day .
 a couple years ago i saw an ama by u/sierrabravo26 about being an air traffic controller .
 he said it was a six figure job that doesn’t require a college degree .
 fast forward to today and i just completed by online basics course for the faa atc academy and i have a tentative reporting date of september 14th .
 thank you u/sierrabravo26 .
 the one where the op asks whether someone can lose karma from being downvoted and someone else in the comment section goes  &apos;yes ,  let me show you &apos; and gets downvoted to oblivion .
 rick astley getting rickrolled was epic .
 the one that has a friend who said  &apos;you like that ,  you fucking retard &apos; as a dirty talk during sex .
 i was there when kevin first entered our lives .
 also the guy that lost the use of his arms for a while so his mum  &apos;helped him &apos; .
 quite a few times until his arms healed .
 the jolly rancher .
 the worst smell ever encountered by a doctor .
 from a woman with maggots in her pussy .
 the time reddit sleuths thought they identified the boston bomber .
 and he was murdered .
 turned out later they had the wrong guy .
 the guy who posted that he thought his wife was cheating on him .
 and reddit advised him to confront her .
 he did and she murdered their two children and stabbed herself (this one is in the news too) .
  &apos;it &apos;s turtles all the way down &apos;
  &apos;i also choose this guys dead wife &apos;
 there was a tifu posted where a guy raised his adoptive son thinking he was chinese .
 taught him all about chinese culture etc .
 then 18 years later comes to find out his son is actually korean .
 wow didn’t expect to see r/formula1 here and i’ve been here for over 10 hours
 he always spells out nineteen ninety-eight
 there &apos;s another similar one out there about a guy &apos;s dad beating him with jumper cables ,  i think ?
 til carbon monooxide can make you see ants
 that &apos;s tumblr ,  op was watching sesame street about a clown trying to wash his hands and it was  &apos;somewhere else in the motel &apos; .
 what the hell was going on there lol
 i &apos;m a bit scared after reading that
 i hate everything about this .
 i need to get off the internet .
 i need the link to this one .
 this is amazing .
 reminds me of an old story .
 the former president gives the new president 3 boxes and asks him to open one each time he is in a major crisis .
 when faced with his first crisis ,  he opens the first box and it says  &apos;blame it on the previous administration &apos; .
 when faced with his second crisis ,  he opens the second box and it says  &apos;blame it on the opposition &apos; .
 when faced with his third crisis (at almost the end of his term) ,  he opens the third box and it says  &apos;remake these 3 boxes and give them to your successor .
 holy shit that &apos;s an actual good shower thought
 that was chilling .
 i worked one year with a student that sounds like that man &apos;s son .
 random attacks out of nowhere .
 no smiles that weren &apos;t malicious .
 graphic depictions of what he was going to do to me that went way beyond what a child like him should be able to envision (he was a 1st grader) .
 talked about the different ways his pets died ,  but looking nearly cheerful about it .
 i was injured several times that year .
 to this day i tense when i hear his name or anyone speak in the same distinctive sounding speech pattern he had (think hannibal lecter with the ebbs and flows that are just a little jarring) .
 i once ran into him at a grocery store and still won &apos;t go there .
 i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s going to recognize my car even though i haven &apos;t seen him in 3 years .
 i was put on him because i was the only one who could keep him even a little bit in line ,  and that was only because i was willing to give him exactly zero strikes .
 it was exhausting and i was seriously relieved when i got a different job .
 i &apos;ve worked with kids who are a handful before .
 if you work with them close enough you usually figure out what triggering their behavior: problems at home ,  trying to fit in with a crowd ,  etc .
 even if you didn &apos;t know it usually became obvious when something was about to trigger them ,  you figured out bobby clicks his tongue when he silent reads and jake can &apos;t stand it  and expressed his frustrations through slamming his hand on bobby &apos;s desk and telling him to stfu .
 you make sure bobby and jake sit nowhere near each other and maybe invest in a white noise machine and you can work on figuring out that jake &apos;s dad just left them .
 but not this kid .
 we could never find a trigger ,  a scenario outside school ,  nothing .
 we had experts come in to look at him and he &apos;d suddenly be the most charming child on the planet ,  but before they made it to the parking lot he &apos;d be trying to bite us .
 we begged his parents to try to take him to a therapist our a doctor ,  but they just kept trying to change his diet .
 if this kid grows into a serial killer i would not be  shocked in the slightest .
 i occasionally google his name just to see if anything had happened with him .
 that &apos;s the kind of story that makes you rethink your entire family dynamic and really your whole life .
 wow--that was quite the read !
 the poster mentions we need to talk about kevin ,  but it also reminded me of doris lessing &apos;s the fifth child .
 i hate to say it .
  my son is like this (he &apos;s 24 now) and since the time he was born he couldn &apos;t be made happy .
  angry every day .
  he upped the ante after his father died of als when he was 14 and he knew i couldn &apos;t do a damn thing to stop him from venting his anger .
  he wasn &apos;t physically violent but would say the most horrific things ,  had 0 empathy and wouldn &apos;t lift a finger but expected to be taken care of like a prince .
  i finally grew angry when i had bronchitis and he wouldn &apos;t let the dogs out; i tried to take away his electronics (he was 17) .
  he grabbed my wrists and squeezed them so hard ,  and the look of pleasure in his eyes was crazy .
  i leaned down and bit his arm to make him let go .
  he walked out the door ,  called the cops ,  they came over and i told them what had happened and they took me to jail because biting him was assault ,  but grabbing and squeezing my wrists wasn &apos;t .
  when i got out of jail 3 days later (i was booked in on a thursday night and couldn &apos;t get out until monday) ,  he was gone .
  2 months later i get a call that he had been hit by a car in a crosswalk ,  he had a head injury and pelvis broken .
  i brought him home from the hospital where he continued where he left off .
  he moved out again after he recovered ,  then called me a year later needing a place to live because he had called the cops on a roommate .
  he came back ,  there was more of the same ,  he left and now i live in fear of his needing anything from me again .
  he &apos;s just broken .
  he &apos;s been in therapy since his dad died but i know for a fact that he doesn &apos;t tell his therapist everything; he is manipulative and so cunning .
 and i have dreams that he breaks in and kills me .
  he says everything is my fault because i  &apos;couldn &apos;t keep my legs closed &apos; and gave birth to him .
  he blames me because he was born and consent to that .
  so while op &apos;s story may not be true ,  there are elements of it that are indeed true enough  .
 holy shit that was much worse than i expected .
 listening to that 911 call recording ,  i &apos;m so surprised how the operator maintains his calmness even though it can be sensed that he &apos;s absolutely horrified by this call .
 they &apos;re not wrong .
 i saw one once of a kid on r/inflation asking for inflation fetish videos .
 cool ,  another one i saw in the wild
 psa: the first comment is the transcription .
  scroll down instead of trying to read the blurry image .
 there is cringe and then there is .
  and there at the end i thought he was wrapping up with a  &apos;lesson learned &apos; on how to interact/read ppl .
  i want to go 5mins back in time and make a better choice about clicking this link .
 i thought he had learned that his behavior was creepy ,   but then just doubled down .
 sad cringe ,   indeed .
 everyone remembers this .
 its for a church honey !
 i remember this from r/choosingbeggars !
 it’s for church ,  honey .
 “jesus already gave me two burrito forks .
 one at the end of each arm .
 they’re called fucking hands .
 ” brought me to tears
 if you want to cry ,  the podcast endless thread spoke with the author of this comment in one of their episodes ,  i believe the title was “shipwrecked .
 ” i was listening to it while out for a run awhile back and i was openly crying in the street .
 i lost my dad in march of 2017 ,  and recently my sister described grief like walking around carrying a box with a ball in it and a button .
  the ball gets smaller and smaller as time goes on ,  hitting the button less and less ,   but when it hits the button it might of well have been yesterday .
 it &apos;s been 5 months ,  no updates .
 i hope she is doing ok .
 is there any way we can check in on her ?
 can the mods do anything ?
 it really does sound like a dangerous and alarming situation .
 i think about this post regularly ,  it was scary as hell .
 this is the only situation i have ever seen that would make doxxing justifiable .
 i have wondered about this poor woman for the last five months .
 i hope she is laying low at her parent &apos;s house ,  enjoying her baby ,  and divorcing this man !
 think the fact he specified that it was 6 feet long and 1 .
 5 feet wide made it worse ,  that thing was fucking gargantuan
 i think i read #2 .
 iirc it was a comment under a video in which someone blocked a car from using the right highway shoulder to get ahead of a traffic jam .
 the op of the comment said that people should stop blocking right wing drivers like that ,  cuz they never know why they are doing it .
 then he described how his buddy cut his thigh in a chainsaw accident and when they were rushing into a hospital ,  they got blocked from using the right wing ,  and the person kept blocking them for some time .
 from that point i dont remember if they made it to the hospital or if cops stopped them and took him there themselves ,  i might have my memories mixed up
 ooh i know this one .
 i just saw it a few days ago and my god !
 it is a rollercoaster
 this one times a million .
 his arrogance at the beginning is astounding .
 i really hope that his story has turned others away from giving heroin a try .
 my little brother died in 2017 from an accidental fentanyl od .
 i appreciate anything that keeps people knowledgeable and open to realizing that you never even want to tempt a heroin addiction .
 one time someone had gone digging through my comment history on another account and said  &apos;you post in r/anime so youre clearly just a fat neckbeard who will die alone &apos; .
 i looked at his post history and his literal last post was on relationship advice saying  &apos;i am a fat neckbeard who will probably die alone &apos; .
 i guess people really do project their insecurities onto others .
 my favorite response to that story is the guy with the metal detector who says  &apos;i &apos;ll find those fucking beans &apos;
 i will not jeopardize the beans .
 do you have a link ?
 i feel like i need more context .
 this needs to be higher up .
 i spent the best part of half an hour reading the whole saga ,  completely enthralled .
 i’ve not seen that one before .
 it’s a post of epic proportions ,  but that ending is a real punch to the gut .
 holy sweet jesus .
 i had read the original post yonks ago .
 but i hadn &apos;t seen any of the updates .
 oh i was having so much fun remembering that story until i got to the updates i didn &apos;t see .
  poor guy and his wife i feel so bad for .
 i had not followed up on the updates .
 that’s fucking insane .
 i kept up with this real time .
 it was such a fun entertaining ride .
 such a turn though .
 i read all of the updates and i wish i didn’t read the last one .
 shit took a turn for the worse .
 fucking hell that &apos;s so random just imagine saving your life by doing something like this level of random and dumb
 reminds me of a text i saw that someone got from a doordash deliver driver .
  &apos;this text conversation is related to a doordash order .
  &apos;hey they all out of lesanya &apos; .
  &apos;the shit garfield eat &apos;
 not as exciting but somewhat in the same vein is steven seagal &apos;s ama .
 i hope this comment finds you up from the toilet seat with blood circulation in your legs
 all those  &apos;i &apos;m never going out again &apos; comments are hitting differently in 2020
 god yes that left a serious impression on me .
 not so r/aww anymore
 i got bit by a strange dog in a foreign country and this is the thread that convinced me five giant needles (and expensive) were worth it
 i think of this one often lol
 this one of the first reddit stories i ever remember reading .
 wait thats what that was about ?
 i remember seeing paul blart: mall cop on the most random posts lmao
 i fucking love how he did it out of spite to prove one dude wrong
 that was gonna be my answer .
 one ,  it &apos;s fucking hilarious ,  especially the end of the original reply .
 two ,  the dude added an explanation of why this works the way it does .
 three ,  the idiot he was proving wrong racked up 54k negative karma in /r/wtf and abandoned the account .
 for some reason i thought that the girlfriend buried the beans ,  not baked them
 omg i just laughed so hard .
 that wasn &apos;t the tipping point ,  the whole mess boiled over a month later after victoria taylor lost her job .
 pao basically set herself up as the fall guy and scapegoated herself ,  and people didn &apos;t realise until after she &apos;d gone .
 “he’s not a hoarder” .
 “now there are 2100 cartons of yoghurt in our apartment” .
 good god how have not seen this one before .
 likely to be invention but such an entertaining read hahaha .
 reading through that ,  if i wanted to collect yoghurt i &apos;d dehydrate or freeze dry samples .
 i think a freeze drying machine is even in the ballpark of a new fridge too .
 his yoghurt collecting hobby could have been 100% reasonable ,  but no ,  he had to have fresh stuff lying around rotting .
 the image of this is hilarious .
 as the original guy on this thanks for the laughs
 haha ,  i did something similar by accident but it was to my coworker and when they made it up said -  &apos;having a laugh this morning ,  eh ?
 snot came out of nose dude
 i snuck a pizza past my husband today .
 quarantine makes different things much more exciting than they would have been before .
 saddest part is he probably only learned not to admit it next time
 what &apos;s worse/sadder is the boyfriend admitted that his own father was the one who taught him to keep putting down a partner so they &apos;d never leave .
 my ex did this to me !
 i wish i had seen the post .
 he would always tell me i stink but wouldn’t elaborate so i would do everything to make sure i didn’t smell bad ,  i even got complimented by other people that i smelled good ,  but he’d still tell me almost daily that i stink .
 i dont know anyone else dealt with something like that .
 he did a lot more but that was the weird one .
 after reading through the comments i’m not sure why so many people don’t believe it happened ,  i’m curious why it seems so unbelievable ?
 i never told anyone when i was dealing with it so now i wonder how many others have dealt with a situation like this and didn’t say anything ,  maybe that’s why ?
 my father literaly did that ,  an yet 13 years later didnt recover
 there &apos;s a subbreddit for this  .
 la didnt just put 2 and 2 together .
 they basically guessed every answer on the test correctly without reading the questions .
 that was a heck of leap to connect the two posts .
 color me impressed .
 u/jimros is the one who put it together .
 you’re letting me live in your head rent free huh ?
 doesn’t sound very healthy to me
 i should not have clicked the first one .
 hurts so bad ,  even from an outsider &apos;s perspective .
 if someone did that to my attempts at writing as a kid ,  i &apos;d be absolutely gutted .
 in college i took a business class with a guy who used to be a union rep at an airline ,  high-up enough that he was in contract negotiations .
  he told us that there &apos;s two kinds of things that unions can do if they need to put the screws to management -  &apos;lightswitch &apos; actions and permanent actions .
  lightswitch actions are stuff like strikes or slow-downs - the moment that an agreement is reached ,  the action can be turned off immediately and everything is fine now .
  permanent actions can &apos;t be recalled though .
  so when you hire the private detective to follow around the guys on the other side of the negotiating table as you and it &apos;s revealed that one of them is stepping out on his wife ,  realize that if you use that as a negotiating tactic and you need to pull that trigger then you can never make it go away .
 that &apos;s colored my thoughts on punitive actions ever since .
  there are things you can &apos;t take back and permanence doesn &apos;t really have an appropriate place in punishment .
  turning the minecraft server off would have been a perfectly appropriate punishment here ,   &apos;it turns on when you get up on time ,  otherwise it &apos;s off for the day &apos; .
 this was just cruelty .
 i think about this so often .
 i literally don’t care if it’s fake or not .
 it’s called suspending disbelief for enjoyment
 i think about this story all the time .
 every time something ordinary seems a little odd i think my time has come to wake up .
 it honestly freaks me out .
 i came here to say this !
 i always call it the lamp story and it gets me every time i read it .
 there &apos;s another one out there where a girl thought her boyfriend was drugging her because she was blacking out and she kept finding little red bumps on her skin but she really had bedbugs and they were making her so sick she would lose huge gaps of time .
 i haven &apos;t seen that thread since but apparently it was fake or something .
 y &apos;all can look into it for yourselves ,  i &apos;m not your maid .
 dude saved someones life and only got 6 .
 i made a joke about someone &apos;s ass and got 8k .
 reddit is weird .
 an actual unpopular opinion .
 the fucking lunatic .
  that is the first genuinely unpopular opinion that i have ever seen associated with that sub .
  that person is a monster wearing human skin .
 i feel bad for that kid
 and this cocksucker calls her a deadbeat ?
 where does all the dough come from ,  if she &apos;s out  &apos;living her best life ?
 my favorite comment by that op is  &apos;i thought she would bond during the pregnancy &apos; lmao bro what a dumbass .
 you got what you wanted and now this poor child has to suffer the consequences
 reading that scumbags comments to the replies he got made my blood boil .
  what a fucking loser .
 she was cleaning her actual poop ?
 with his socks ?
 i remember that one .
 at the end she left him ,  dodged a bullet
 the parents of disabled children post  is .
 i may be done with reddit for the day .
 yeah ,  i had friends who died eventually ,  a couple that survived ,  and somehow i made it out unscathed .
 0/10 would not risk .
 i don &apos;t know why i never got addicted ,  but i &apos;m the 1/million who got lucky ,  and it haunts me when i think about my dead friend &apos;s faces .
 they &apos;ll never get older in my head ,  and that &apos;s the worst part .
 i was scrolling looking for this one .
 his username is /u/spontaneoush if anyone wants to have a look .
 the original posts are about 10 years back and he claims to be clean for the past 6 or so years .
 don’t do heroin ,  not even once .
 i know spanish and the comments are an absolute show of who can say the most random shit
 he did not expect the spanish inquisition
 it &apos;s hard to believe it &apos;s been 10 years .
 that is fucking hilarious
 this is what i was thinking too .
 it holds the record for the most downvoted comment by a long shot .
 the second most downvoted comment has something like 100 , 000 downvotes ,  but even that is from a thanos meme where op asked the users to keep the post’s upvotes balanced with the downvotes on his comment .
 yeah ,  that story is still my favorite
 i didn &apos;t do _nothing .
 _ subtitling is a fair amount of detailed work and a crap ton of typing .
 the real bliss of it all was never having to leave home and being very good at what i did .
 it wasn &apos;t a meme ,  either ,  just a screenshot of an unreleased show .
 he did the closed captioning for a shitload of stuff .
 for him it was a dream job - he got paid to watch tv in his pj’s all day .
 he posted a single frame of an unreleased episode and somehow the mouse found it ,  and was able to trace it back to him .
 he owned up and hoped for the best ,  and they blacklisted him .
 since the mouse and it’s properties accounted for such a huge amount of his potential clientele he was effectively forced out of the industry .
 i think he said that he didn’t mind the mailman job because it got him out of the house ,  but god damn ,  if ever there was a story about killing the goose that laid the golden eggs .
 i think it’s more-so what happens when you drill a hole in a coconut ,  repeatedly put your dick in it ,  jizz in it ,  and in it’s off-time you keep it under your bed in your humid ass house .
 but yeah ,  that one definitely scarred me a little .
 but i never really thought about how those stories gloss over the pain and resentment of victims who are unable to forgive unforgivable actions but are inadvertently made to feel guilty and ashamed for feeling that way .
 somewhat related: i read a post on here about a woman whose husband  came out of the closet; he had been sleeping with men on the sly in the years prior .
 her entire social circle celebrated his acceptance of his sexuality - skipping over the cheating and the wife and children he left behind .
 her resenting him for leaving was met with accusations of homophobia .
 i think it &apos;s perfectly okay to be angry if your husband leaves ,  even for a reason that &apos;s good in the abstract .
 and the guy could definitely have been less of a jerk about it (in that specific case) .
 do i want to know how that got verified ?
 no thanks for sending me down a dark ,  twisty ,  uncomfortable rabbit hole .
 my brain hurts now .
 literally everyone on reddit will come across the original post at some point .
 any mention of broken bones leads to it .
 it &apos;s exactly like winning the game .
 eventually it will turn back up .
 i &apos;m actually surprised he still posts on reddit with that account .
 this is the most time i &apos;ve ever spent reading an iama
 ha ,  i dated a girl who had never heard the word  &apos;alley &apos; before .
   not  &apos;alley cat &apos; ,  not  &apos;bowling alley &apos; ,  and had never seen a house whose driveway was in the back instead of the front .
   i drove her past my childhood home ,  and she said  &apos;wow ,  i can &apos;t believe nobody on your street is home on a sunday afternoon &apos; (because there were no cars parked at the curbs) .
   i said  &apos;they probably went in through the alley &apos;  ,  and she laughed at me and said  &apos;the what ?
 she laughed at the sound of the word  &apos;alley &apos; ,  and teased me about throwing french words into conversation to try and sound fancy .
  she was baffled at the idea of  &apos;a tiny street just for getting into the back yards &apos; ,  and just wouldn &apos;t believe that everyone on the street would uanimously agree to design their home with the garage in the back .
 i was certain she was pulling a  &apos;no ,  what is potato ?
  she was just very very sheltered ,   and very very ignorant ,  and very very confident that i was trying to tease or make fun of her .
   she never stopped doubling down .
  eventually it got really sad .
 that is the true definition of dedication
  &apos;your sex life went from vanilla to chocolate real fast .
 such a solid gold comment .
 it &apos;s still a little strange running into your 10 year old comment ,  even though i figured it &apos;d be here somewhere .
 y u gotta make me cry
 this is one of my favourites ,  too .
 i’m from a part of canada where a lot of our immigrants are sikh and indian ,  and they are the kindest hearted people ever .
 ever time i see them succeeding or generally enjoying their lives i’m so proud they are here !
 lmao im saving that one
 guarantee i’ll see this this response get absolutely beat to death in the comments from now on
 reminds me of that one guy who &apos;s mom told him  &apos;you should carry around a house plant to replace all the air you &apos;re wasting &apos;
 lol that &apos;s what i came to say as well .
 i was still pretty new to reddit when that one came up and it &apos;s just stuck with me .
 the weirder part is that his friends ate his foot too .
 like ,  he hit up his friends and invited them to a dinner party and on the menu is his foot .
 i believe it was a fake greentext story if that &apos;s any consolation
 i &apos;m such a loser that i was legitimately excited to be witnessing history .
 it will probably be the second thing that flashes before my eyes when i die; the first being my dog being terrified of his own fart .
 might be time to go outside .
 i &apos;m really glad to see this .
 there &apos;s a poignancy to the story after as well .
 by what little there was out there ,  the author appears to have taken their own life a while later .
 it always struck me hard to know that even near their darkest hour they wanted to give someone else hope ,  or at least a little happiness .
 do you have a link to the one about the guy being cheated on/murdered ?
 came here to look for this .
  i &apos;m far down the list but even after all this time i &apos;m still on it .
 i came here to say this .
 it &apos;s one of the funniest things i &apos;ve ever seen .
 that moment when you’ve found the absolute god-tier post that you can spend hours and hours on .
 i’m on 12 ,  at least .
 this is an amazing post
 carbon monoxide can do some crazy shit to your brain
 i have had a legit on-going carpenter ant infestation in my house for years .
 i wish it was carbon monoxide poisoning .
 i had to sort by controversial to see some real replies:) got creeped out for a second too .
 every account on reddit is a bot except you
 wait ,  what ,  the parents just tried to change his diet ?
 this sounds like a fun read .
 edit-that was literally the funniest thing i’ve read on reddit .
 some people are skilled at finding old posts ,  huh
  &apos;what the fuck &apos; does not even begin to describe this .
 this is so fucking sad .
 i swear this thread is filled with heartbreaking stories .
 if his wife was a kind of person to stab her own kids to death ,  i don &apos;t think things could have gone much better without the divorce anyways ,  so that comment guy is not actually that guilty .
 he understandably felt absolutely terrible ,  ended up offering to make a quilt for op .
 this is the sweetest grasping at straws ever
 this is what the comment reply was
 i found you after i needed you .
 yeah i also thought he was gonna have this moment of realization of sorts .
 hopefully got some professional help of sorts .
 and when he said he found his next wife .
 he just moved on to another streamer huh
 you know how people brought to hysterical tears refer to it as  &apos;ugly crying &apos; ?
 this post makes me  &apos;ugly laugh &apos; every goddamn time .
 i can &apos;t even read through the whole comment without tearing up .
 it &apos;s so perfectly put and it &apos;s very poetic .
 shit ,  her original submission in aita was deleted .
 does anyone have an archive link ?
 i guess we will only find out when the child becomes a redditor and posts something about having only a father and grandfather as relatives and both their mother and grandmother died in child birth
 i really need an update for this .
  kinda hoping it was just fake ,  some sort of weird joke .
 you can go to her account and click the drop down menu at the top right and then choose  &apos;get her help and support .
  &apos; it has a little heart next to it .
 they had plans to meet the ambulance ,  which was followed by a police officer ,  and when they got there the lady thought they were going to get arrested for speeding ,  and the officer showed her the back seat of the car .
 me and the boys at 3am looking for beans .
 thanks for all the upvotes !
 this is the most liked comment/post out of every social media account i run .
 i don’t know why but this comment literally made me cry laughing .
 like i picture such a stern fellow in pursuit of some fucking beans
 i &apos;m about to buy a metal detector just to find those fucking beans .
 as soon as i saw the first reply from the wife ,  my stomach dropped .
 and now here i am ,  crying over a british man i never met .
 op was an amazing guy
 “i have depresian” .
 damnnn ,  last post was 4 years ago .
 i think his dad did done him in finally .
 it made me really question all the stray dogs i enjoyed petting and feeding on my trip to india
 it is not lifelong ,  if you have a possible rabies exposure you need to get treated asap
 it &apos;s fun reading a super old legendary reddit comment ,  and you already have it upvoted .
 for real ,  this is a+ level dedication .
 that too at 3 in the morning .
 but now i am so sad she baked them beans .
 this is the one that always gets me
 i love how confidently he writes this like we have any idea what he is talking about
 that’s a different ,  equally amusing post
 but i hates what she did to my beans .
 i &apos;m guessing the op wasn &apos;t a native english speaker ,  but god help me ,  this post sounds like it was written by gollum from an alternate story arc .
 i miss victoria’s iamas .
 she kept the person on track ,  made sure good questions were being answered ,  and made sure the answers were in depth enough to be worth it .
 she was a good’un .
 i can just imagine how evil he looked to the father and son as he stood there with a goofy smile while pushing the close button .
 yeah ,  like a sick cycle of abuse
 that story is the reason i will never try any hard drugs .
 i love watching la threads that slowly turn on the op as they figure out which one &apos;s actually in the wrong .
 hate to break it to you ,  but i think you &apos;re an anti-semite .
 thanks for finding them ,  i couldn’t remember any of the names involved
 this is so interesting .
 anyone know what was the outcome ?
 you have a lot of roommates so it can &apos;t be too great for you either tbh
 definitely a bit of a jump-scare ,  for me anyways .
 upvoting you for the other poor shmucks ,  hopefully it helps .
 my dad decided to come into my room and throw away everything but the furniture and my clothes .
 it didn &apos;t feel good .
 he also at one point decided i had too many tubs of stuff (they easily fit in my closet with lots of extra space) .
  he informed me i had to empty out 2 of them .
  later i realized it was just because he wanted to use those tubs himself for his giant hoard of shit that would never be used again .
 right ,  why did he jump from zero to delete minecraft world and not just no minecraft for the day ?
  every so often i &apos;ll find myself staring at an everyday object for a little longer than i should ,  trying to notice the irregular perspective .
 my life is fine ,  but i &apos;m still scared of waking up .
 i hadn &apos;t ever heard this story before and it reminded me of my high school girlfriend &apos;s family ,  which seemed to have similar problem with toilet clogging poops .
 i was at her house as i often was ,  as we &apos;ve were dating 2-3 years at that point ,  and i was pretty much a member of her family at that point .
 so it goes without saying that her family was pretty comfortable we me there ,  and didn &apos;t treat me like a standard guest anymore .
 she had a younger brother named bobby and he was the standard level of dorky younger brother othat most are .
 her mom ,  janet was very chill and cool and rarely got angry .
 her father jay ,  was a different story he was mostly calm a lot of the time ,  but once he passed a threshold ,  he became unreasonably angry and it took him a little bit to wind back down .
 you could see it when we watched football games together ,  where over time as the bad calls stacked up and ultimately damaged the game he would rant very loudly and for a long time about what kind of life the ref had to have lived to eventually decide to become an nfl ref ,  with the sole mission in life to fuck the ny giants .
 the rage he built himself to always started off a pretty serious and little scary ,  but they went on for so long that after a while they became funny and epic .
 they even got him a little ref plush doll with detachable limbs and head to throw at the tv ,  which he used very often .
 besides yelling at nfl refs about the nyg ,  the only other triggers he had (besides me holding his daughter &apos;s hand) was having to unexpectedly work on the house .
 so cut to one random day where everyone is home and bobby goes into the bathroom and is in there for long enough for jay to knock on the door to tell him to hurry up because he has to go too .
 there was only one bathroom in the house .
 so out comes bobby and sheepishly announces he thinks he clogged the toilet and couldn &apos;t unclog it with the plunger .
 jay goes into the bathroom ,  takes one look at the toilet and just goes off .
 it starts with a criticism of bobby &apos;s diet ,  and how if maybe he wasn &apos;t eating so much junk food and had a bit more fiber ,  he wouldn &apos;t have such a ridiculous turd ,  and smaller  &apos;more manageable amounts &apos; .
 somehow this was tied to bobby &apos;s lack of respect to for the home he was being provided and the roof over his head .
 the phrase  &apos;negative crap &apos; both a physical thing ,  and just a way of spirit and life seems to be at the core of the rant .
 how bobby &apos;s  &apos;negative crap &apos; is just the embodiment of all the things bobby should improve in his life to live better .
 bobby had long retreated to his room ,  which was in the basement ,  and mostly out of earshot of this ,  so it was my gf and i ,  and her mom who were the ones listening to speech ,  while jay tried to work the plunger and undo his son &apos;s attack on his home .
 eventually jay just can &apos;t hold it anymore ,  loudly shuts the bathroom door and there is peace for a while .
 the quiet in the house is broken by a two long flushes ,  back to back .
 out comes jay with a kind of smile on his face and walks into the kitche .
  &apos;i unclogged it &apos; he says to his wife ,  to which she responds with  &apos;what ?
  &apos;i unclogged it with my positive crap &apos; .
 his wife janet ,  makes a disgusted face and says  &apos;oh jay enough with the vulgarness &apos; this kind of wounds him a little bit ,  and he launched into a new rant about how his  &apos;positive crap &apos; is what holds the house together ,  and how his positive attitude is what keeps the pipes flowing .
 she gives me a look that says  &apos;i &apos;m sorry for this &apos; and jay continues on about what it means to be a man and a responsible adult ,  sometimes sticking his head towards the steps that leads to the basement so bobby can hear ,  and eventually all my gf can do is plead with him  &apos;daddy please stop &apos; but can &apos;t help start laughing to which we all start laughing at it .
 all this could have been avoided if they had a poop knife i guess .
 i remember that one !
 that one was wild .
 sounded like a movie script .
 the reddit admins made a change to how karma displays since that post was made ,  so 6 .
 5k was an insane amount back then .
 the weirdest comments get the most upvoted i swear .
 most of my meaningful comments get like 5 max .
 meanwhile a comment about a plot hole in pacific rim is one of my highest ever .
 i think i also saw one about how they liked when washing their hands and water went down their sleeves
 yeah ,  he was totally trying to manipulate the situation .
 he probably assumed that she &apos;d eventually want to be a mother because she &apos;s a woman ,  but it backfired .
 they roasted the ever loving shit out of him at least .
 she was wiping herself with the socks ,  yes !
 they ended up getting back together a year or so later ,  iirc
 the most upvoted are a quote from the tv show community .
 nobody expects the spanish inquisition
 omg over 600k downvoted ?
 good god ,  i &apos;ve never seen so many downvotes before 0 .
 they can take your job ,  but they cannot take your reddit karma .
 man ,  i love reddit .
 do you have a link ?
 my favourite callback to this story was when a guy wrote a tifu post after fucking a shampoo bottle .
 the top response was: .
  &apos; why can &apos;t you fuck a coconut like a normal person ?
 maggots eat your dick
 cheating is cheating no matter what .
 my parents have a few friends in their 70s who &apos;s husbands just came out at 40 or so and just said well ,   &apos;fuck it .
 good bye kids ,  good bye wife ,  been fucking dudes on the side for years i find you disgusting later &apos; .
 imagine getting married young ,  having hopes/dreams and 20 years later your spouse just drops everything .
 there is nothing  &apos;homophobic &apos; about being permanently upset at being steamrolled over and abandoned mid marriage through no fault of your own .
 anyone that would have the balls to reprimand an upset husband or wife that was treated that way deserves a shovel to the face .
 there was a po box t last week on relationship advice about an ex husband not wanting to be part of his ex wives marriage to the woman she cheated on him with ,  and so his kids refused to talk to him ,  and all their friends were pissed at him cqllingnuim homophobic .
 the timeline from divorce to marriage is less than a year .
 is this the coconut oil one ?
 it &apos;s so heartbreaking ,  i read it once ,  never again .
 this story is so heartbreaking ,  it was the first reddit post that made me cry .
 this one haunts me .
 it &apos;s one of the most gut wrenching stories i &apos;ve ever read on reddit ,  and lives permanently in my memory .
 the way she describes her daughters death and how slow and painful it was breaks my heart and makes me so angry that her mother never really faced justice for her egegious negligence .
 this is truly unforgivable and i don &apos;t blame op at all for disowning her .
 there was another one ,  i believe it was in that sub as well ,  where these people had twins and the grandparents were explicitly instructed to not take the kids swimming in any way while they were babysitting .
 the parents had to leave the twins with the grandparents for a funeral or something ,  and explicitly told them (again) not to take them swimming because the grandparents were not the most attentive and the mother just didn &apos;t trust them .
 they took the twins to the beach anyways and one drowned .
 i think i &apos;d actually kill these people .
 that &apos;s truely heartbreaking ,  the fact that her mother was just so selfish and ignorant that she caused a girl to die so young is horrifying
 they supposedly had some academic doing a study on incest that confirmed the study was real and that op and his mother were subjects .
 i &apos;ve looked into it multiple times ,  kind of whenever it gets brought up .
 i &apos;ve never been able to find anything that convinces me that the verification was real .
 i won &apos;t deny that it &apos;s one of the most infamous threads in reddit &apos;s history ,  but i do deny that the story actually happened .
 its fucking wild and sad and sorta like a eerie fetish novel
 except on /r/neverbrokeabone
 not quite as strange ,  but my brothers ex wife had never seen or heard the word extravaganza and we passed a mcdonald &apos;s that said nuggets extravaganza on its sign and she asked ,   &apos;what &apos;s a vaganza ?
  &apos; we had no idea what the hell she was talking about and then she said  &apos;mcdonald &apos;s said they have nuggets with extra vaganza .
  &apos; my brother almost wrecked we were laughing so hard .
 the legend himself !
 in my decades of existence i have yet to see anything else come close to this pun perfection .
 thirty six fucking inches of sandwich ,  oh my god ,  thirty six fucking inches of sandwich .
 90 motherfucking centimeters
 its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that ,  not 12 like some people are saying .
 guys ,  calm down ,  i only ate probably the rough equivalent of 5 or 6 full meals ,  not some ridiculous amount or anything .
 thanks for sharing ,  this is something
 this is amazing .
 what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck
 that was my risky click of the month .
 i don’t think i’m the better for it .
 that &apos;s fucking it ?
 this is worse than the episode of spongebob when the narrator got cut off before revealing the krabby patty secret formula !
 i’ll go with this explanation for the rest of my life .
 thank you ,  i feel better
 i &apos;ve been wondering .
 how do you link stuff like that on reddit
 i clicked on that way too fast and realized too late that you could &apos;ve very easily rick rolled me ,  and there was nothing i could &apos;ve done
 the author appears to have taken their own life a while later .
 i had a quick skim through their post history but i didn &apos;t see anything ,  got any more info on that ?
 thanks dude i lost the comment
 i remember when i saw that for the first time and i &apos;m like  &apos;dude ,  what the fuck &apos; and then you see the original guy is just enjoying it .
 like leaving post it notes for yourself and forget about them .
 he is sherlock ,  y &apos;know .
 the real tragedy is the husband not knowing what an absolute psycho he married .
 fuck those people who let her out of jail .
 look in the comments of the post ,  automod always copies the post
 thank you for letting me know about this feature .
 or those people from don’t f with cats
 and the stories she &apos;s told about him when answering comments .
 decided to read it on my lunch and went from nearly pissing myself laughing to genuine tears .
 now i &apos;m 5 minutes from a zoom meeting trying to get my shit together .
 what a punch to the gut .
 caught it in the beginning ,  decided to backburner it so i could read it as one story after its concluded ,  and now im sad as fuck .
 i &apos;m indian and absolutely love petting the indie strays and i had no idea rabies was this prevalent .
 or this horrific .
 i haven’t i just have a paranoid ass .
 i barely go outside in the first place .
 however my fear for things has few bounds .
 i’ll probably be over the initial shock fear soon but i’m just worried .
 but i hates what she did to my beans
 the switch from “it might be so” to “i am so sad she baked them beans” made me cry laughing
 there are so many bean posts !
 there was also a recent one from a girlfriend &apos;s perspective about the boyfriend completely committing to a  &apos;beanatarian diet &apos; .
 he would only eat beans .
 there &apos;s a whole bunch of redditors in a row leaving reddit in parallel to that comment .
 what the hell was happening ?
 you want nothin’ to do with this dewey !
 the only really hard drug i tried was crack ,  and it feels goddamned incredible the moment it hits your lungs .
 full on euphoria ,  energy levels go through the roof ,  and every nerve in your body tingles in such an incredible way .
 if you &apos;ve spent a night doing cocaine ,  it &apos;s the entire night condensed into that hit .
 the feeling is completely gone by the time you exhale ,  and the need to replace it is so fucking strong .
 okay ,  admittedly ,  you had some of the effect left over ,  but ,  nearly 100% of that high is hyperfocused on  &apos;finding more crack .
  &apos; didya drop a speck of your rock into shag carpet ?
 bet you &apos;ll fucking find it after you start coming down .
 you &apos;ll also wear out your steel wool pushing it back and forth through your tube ,  trying to collect more residue for another hit .
 i just knew i could never do it again .
 it was too fucking good to be worth it .
 i need some legal advice ,  i’m trying to ruin the life of an employee because she’s jewish ,  so obviously i want her to quit .
 you’re a nazi ,  sherry !
 same here- i jumped when i opened it !
 can you describe what it looks like ?
 it &apos;s 3am where i &apos;m at but i &apos;m fucking curious .
 my brother stayed out past curfew one night and my mom raided his closet ,  pulled all his street clothes out ,  and squired a bottle of ketchup and another of mustard all over them .
 he was 19 and had paid for it all himself over the past few years .
 jesus i thought i was the only one .
 anxiety kicks in and you start to think  &apos;that lamp shade isnt going to abide by the laws of physics and im gonna wake up .
  &apos; i also wonder what my actual life would be like .
 ive always had this theory : if you are in a life or death situation ,  lets say your driving and almost get hit by someone else .
 and you think to yourself  &apos;i easily could &apos;ve died there .
  &apos; well what if you did ?
 but to you you actually lived ,  and you &apos;re in a coma or died to everyone in that universe .
  maybe your brain  &apos;skipped &apos; that part where you died .
 i know our brains tend to keep up with momentum like those little brain games ,  they assume the next step and plays tricks on you .
 so i had this event in my life where i tripped super hard on k2 and i &apos;ve never felt the same since .
 i for a while ,  truly thought this was happening to me .
 i can &apos;t find it :(
 damn karma inflation
 that makes more sense .
 safe to say that person is going to hell .
 just read all the updates .
 back together and talking about marriage as of 5 months ago .
 that was quite the strange read
 donde estas la biblioteca .
 it holds the record for most downvotes .
 it holds the record for most downvotes ever .
 should have seen the shit show that comment spawned .
 thousands of battlefront 2 preorders cancelled immediately ,  a projected $3 million in lost sales for ea ,  and absolutely endless mocking from all over the internet .
 it was glorious .
 it holds the record for the most downvoted comment ever
 i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll be able to cash it all in aaaaaany day now .
 i remember that one .
 i feel bad for the guy’s situation .
 it is absolutely uncalled for to invite your ex to your new wedding .
 only in very rare circumstances could i imagine it being ok ,  like if the split was amicable .
 for the ex ,  it would be anywhere from uncomfortable to heartbreaking .
 if i was your juror i &apos;d let you go
 my mil is like this .
   &apos;oh my friend has this thing that i think you should have .
  i &apos;m going to bring it down to your house ,  a 5 hour drive away .
  &apos;no ,  that &apos;s fine ,  we don &apos;t want it .
  please don &apos;t bring it .
  &apos;i &apos;m going to bring the thing i told you about .
  &apos;hi ,  here &apos;s the thing i told you i was going to bring .
  can you get it out of my car ,  it &apos;s too heavy to lift .
 i already told my wife our kid will never spend an overnight alone at the mil &apos; house without us .
 the mod deleting his account was like someone knowing too much and commiting suicide for never getting over it .
 i just said  &apos;extra vaganza &apos; out loud in a strong (and very poor) italian accent .
 it sounded great .
 after he ate his original share
  &apos;i wouldn &apos;t say i &apos;m addicted to food &apos; .
 further down the post .
  &apos;yeah i can eat like five footlongs in an afternoon &apos;
 reminds me of the onion article where the headline was something like  &apos;horrified subway executive assumed people were sharing footlongs with a friend &apos; and the choice line: .
 the sandwich chain says it is ‘deeply sorry &apos; if customers mistakenly believed that eating an entire foot of food could somehow be considered healthy .
 de da deedly da deedly da deedly da deedly daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 oh i just read that one !
 still can &apos;t find it .
 the last one where it started about how the username belonged to her husband ,  my stomach fucking dropped ,  mate .
 for all the folks saying “be a mark” i left thinking damn- i just want someone to love me and talk about me as beautifully as mark’s wife .
 and to think ,  she kept claiming she didn’t know how to write or tell a story .
 i legit just popped open a new box of kleenex ,  so they’re here for everyone who needs them now .
 sheesh ,  op should’ve warned us better going in .
 that was not just a gut punch .
 as an introverted awkward person who people can tend to ignore ,  the story of phoebe was beautiful .
 i hate myself for reading that thread .
 am empty in my soul pls send help
 the good news is that you &apos;ll generally know if you &apos;ve been bit by a wild animal .
 and if you find a bat in your house ,  get the shots .
 between steak and potatoes i’m crying laughing
 and he never paid for drugs .
 my favorite line was  &apos;can we fire her because she doesn &apos;t fit into our company culture ?
 a poor quality ,  slightly grainy/pixelated black and white image of a figure standing on someone’s porch ,  leaning in towards the door with a creepy smiling expression .
 their face looks like that of a woman wearing makeup ,  but their eyes appear a solid gray with no discernible pupil/iris .
 the way they are leaning makes their head appear disproportionately big for their body ,  and their arms are not visible ,  though the ends of the sleeves of their t-shirt are .
 their hair is either pulled tightly to their head or nonexistent
 he was 19 and had paid for it all himself over the past few years .
 depending on how much it was all worth ,  wouldn &apos;t this have been felony vandalism ?
 also ,  how tf do you enforce a curfew on a legal adult ?
 ive always had this theory : if you are in a life or death situation ,  lets say your driving and almost get hit by someone else .
 and you think to yourself  &apos;i easily could &apos;ve died there .
  &apos; well what if you did ?
 but to you you actually lived ,  and you &apos;re in a coma or died to everyone in that universe .
 maybe your brain  &apos;skipped &apos; that part where you died .
 that &apos;s actually a thing -- it &apos;s called something like  &apos;quantum immortality &apos; or  &apos;quantum suicide &apos; .
 boils down to splitting timelines .
 imagine you &apos;re playing russian roulette .
 you pull the trigger and live .
 you pull again ,  nothing .
 you pull an infinite number of times but the gun never fires because your consciousness has to observe the outcome and must be alive to do so .
 you still die in an infinite number of newly parallel universes ,  but in the one in which you still exist ,  the gun never fires .
 disclaimer: don &apos;t try testing this .
 best case scenario for you leaves a split universe where people grieve ,  worst case you &apos;re just maimed and a vegetable without a split universe
  &apos; said satan ,    .
  &apos;you &apos;ve made it to hell !
 now let &apos;s take a look at the reason you fell !
 the real explanation you &apos;re all out of luck !
 he read from his ledger .
 he whispered:  &apos; .
 that is so fucking strange i don’t think i could live with someone who does that
 fuck ,  has that really been two years ago ?
 yeah ,  but no other post comes remotely close
 i’m happy you’re a good sport about it lol
 dude cut a hole and started fucking a coconut ,  left on vacation for a week ,  came back and decided to fuck the coconut one more time ,  stuck his dick in ,  then pulled it out and it was covered in maggots
 i was always frustrated with the amount of attention my partner gave to his ex wife .
 it was like they were still married ,  just not fucking ,  and she made no secret of her contempt for me .
 when she invited us to her wedding ,  he insisted on going .
 he said he could go without me but dammed if i was gonna let that happen .
 it was horrible - she kept calling me by the wrong name and although she had made a big deal about the fact that she gotten vegan food just for me ,  it was all gone by the time my table got food .
 he insisted on inviting her to our wedding ,  but she didn &apos;t come because she said she would be uncomfortable .
 oh hey he &apos;s my ex-husband now .
 not because of her ,  but because of the mistress ,  whom i refer to as his third ex-wife .
 ok thats fucking great
 i’m on mobile ,  so i don’t know how to link the specific auto mod comment .
 i hope this is allowable as it’s the full post .
 “lotta context the character limit cuts off ,  but here &apos;s the gist: my husband and i are expecting our first child ,  which i knew would be a really sensitive issue as his own mother died in childbirth with him .
 we met with a marriage counselor to talk things through at the beginning ,  and he swears he’s been seeing his own therapist twice a month throughout my pregnancy .
 i don’t want to call him a liar ,  but i’m fairly sure he’s either not going or not talking about the big issue—he and his father (a hugely active part of our lives) are completely convinced that i’m going to die in childbirth .
 they won’t openly admit it ,  but their behavior has reached the point where it’s constantly making me feel stressed and uncomfortable .
 when it was husband saying “please make sure your life insurance is up to date” and “i’d like you to meet with a lawyer and draft a will” ,  i was like “that’s kind of intense but ok ,  if that makes you feel better” .
 when husband asked me to go through all of my possessions and “inventory” what i wanted to be saved for the baby vs .
 what i would want to be returned to my family in the event of my death ,  i put my foot down and said absolutely not .
 my fil (who lives a few blocks away and eats dinner with us 2-4 nights a week) got on my case about how i was making things “difficult” for my husband in the event that he will be a grieving widower with a newborn .
 i’m just gonna add here that i’ve had a completely complication-free pregnancy and have no reason to think i will die screaming in the coming weeks .
 when i tell my husband this ,  he calls me paranoid ,  but i feel like my fil wants me to die; his whole life identity for the past 35 years has been “amazing single dad” (never dated or had close friends or even hobbies really) ,  and it seems like he’s looking forward to being able to guide my husband through what he went through .
 at this point ,  i’d honestly be happy to never see my fil again ,  and i certainly don’t want him in the delivery room ,  especially since he told me he was “putting his foot down” about me not being “allowed” to have an epidural or laughing gas .
 he’s a commanding presence and i know that whatever he wants in the delivery room ,  he will get (i know people will say “oh l&d nurses would never let that happen !
 ” but you haven’t met this man) .
 my husband ,  in addition to backing his dad on everything ,  acts like my due date is my death date ,  and has completely pulled away from me .
 every minute with him is morbid ,  stressful ,  and a reminder that our marriage seems to be crumbling .
 no matter how many times i tell him his behavior makes me stressed and upset ,  it’s just getting worse ,  and i do not want it around me while i’m concentrating on giving birth .
 do i owe it to my husband to let him stress and upset me during labor ?
 is his presence at the birth more important than a safe and healthy delivery ?
 my therapist says “no” ,  but this whole thing has been so weird i feel like i need some outside perspective .
 i went from laughing for the whole story ,  to smiling for his apparent recovery and then whe her wife started using to past tense referring to his husband my heart sank .
 i &apos;m so sad for a man i never knew and met .
 for some reason ,  reading “phoebe and i must circulate” broke me .
 read her replies in the last thread .
 so much love there .
 do you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for what you &apos;ve done since then ?
 would you like to buy one ,  for $4 .
 it has twice as many downvotes as the top post of all time has upvotes
 the moment of change is terrifying ,  but everything that comes after is usually pretty exciting .
 i was always the person to move across the country (twice !
 ) without really having a plan ,  so this is just another chapter .
 i remember this ,  what a pair of jackasses .
 i hope op never updated because she was busy divorcing this idiot and establishing full custody .
 wow people hate ea
 this is the canonical explanation for the tp hoarders
 don &apos;t have sex with so-and-so because they have herpes
 sell all the stocks in february and buy tesla calls in march .
 start a twitch/youtube channel that predicts 2020 accurately and have everyone think i &apos;m nostradamus .
 i would go to the doctor in early january to check on my kidneys .
 maybe we could save them .
 idk ,  cry ,  invest ,  reset ,  repeat .
 i &apos;m gonna be real sad because i just spent the year losing a ton of weight ,  and i don &apos;t want to start over .
 get a haircut in february .
 all of these saddening comments make me realise just how much i &apos;ve taken this year and my life so far for granted .
 the saddest story i have for this year is losing my best dog friend i grew up with .
 heart breaking yes ,  but nothing like some of the stories i &apos;ve read on here .
 i hope losing my dog is the saddest story of 2020 i &apos;ll have to share ,  and hopefully the saddest for many many years to come .
 wish u all the best fellow redditnerds x
 i &apos;d probably go to california and just tell a couple what gender their kid would be .
 i can &apos;t stop a pandemic but i can halt a wildfire .
 edit : thank you everyone for the awards ,  much appreciated !
 tell nevada to start counting mail in ballots before the election day .
 i &apos;d sit my brother down ,  tell him how much i love him ,  and hug him till my arms give out .
 i &apos;d tell him how much i miss when we were kids and spent every day together .
 he was my twin born two years late and i &apos;d give up everything to see him again .
 i would beg him not to go out that night .
 i would schedule a camping trip and we &apos;d have so much fun .
 say  &apos;aw shit ,  here we go again &apos;
 -invest in zoom ,  toilet paper ,  hand sanitizer .
 -hang out with people while i still can  .
 -not take the little things for granted
 spend more time with my friends that killed themselves .
 i know i wouldn’t be able to save them ,  but i wouldn’t have all the regrets i have now
 off to new zealand
 spend much more time with my old kitty that passed away on january second and with my old doggo that passed away in september .
 and spoil them with their favorite treats and lots of fun toys .
 i miss them so much .
 this years been rough .
 well the cancer was probably already terminal so i’d just try to see my mom before all the flights were cancelled
 there &apos;s an episode of doctor who called turn left ,  where the doctor dies a few years before the year the episode is set ,  causing mayhem across the world because he couldn &apos;t stop calamities that crippled and would eventually end the world .
 the protagonist of the episode ,  the doctor &apos;s current companion ,  goes back in time to the episode &apos;s divergent point and kills herself in an attempt to ensure that the doctor lives and the timeline is corrected .
 if i woke up on january 1st ,  2020 ,  i would aim to achieve donna noble &apos;s goal ,  preferably without dying ,  but hey .
 why should one life stand in the way of ,  what ,  a million now ?
 show my husband just how much i love him and appreciate him .
 hug him longer ,  kiss him harder ,  squeeze his warm hands ,  laugh with him ,  record his voice ,  take more pics of him and of us together ,  not sweat the small stuff ,  be silly with him ,  savour every meal he made me ,  stare into his eyes and marvel in their clarity and sparkle .
 lay my head on his chest to hear his heartbeat everyday .
 he died in may at age 31 .
 i &apos;d give anything to wake up tomorrow and see his bright blue eyes .
 oh my goodness ,  i wrote this at about 3am and then went to sleep ,  i had no idea it was cause this much attention .
 thank you to everyone who has commented ,  sent me well wishes and love and thank you for all of the lovely awards .
 not sure i deserve so much kindness but i sure as hell appreciate it .
 he left our house walking ,  talking and smiling back at me as he got in to the ambulance and less than 24 hours later i felt his heart stop under my hand .
 he was already sedated when i arrived at the hospital so im not even sure he knew i was there but i pray he did .
 no one deserves to think they are dying alone .
 he was the light of my life ,  my best friend and i miss him more than even i can comprehend .
 don &apos;t sweat the small stuff ,  folks .
 in the end ,  it rarely ever matters .
 peace and love to you all
 tell my grandma not to travel and stay home .
 i lost her to covid on monday .
 her death will always hurt due to how preventable it was and how long it’d been since i’ve seen her .
 i will always miss her .
 was honestly not expecting much attention for this comment but thank you everyone for your condolences and messages .
 although she passed ,  she did everything she wanted to do in her final days and lived a long life ,  living to see her great-grandchildren .
 i thank you all for the support 
 5 years of phd research data before an accidental wipe removed all of it back in february .
 wow ,  this blew up !
 thanks for the kind people giving awards .
 i &apos;m trying to respond to all the comments .
 but one thing i &apos;ll just mention here .
 most of the data lost was work i published by then ,  so it would &apos;ve been nice to keep the codes but losing them wasn &apos;t a major loss .
 but one work was unpublished ,  thankfully it was recent so i was able to rewrite the code from memory and publish it 2 months ago .
 so the damage was mostly controlled .
 thankfully ,  my professor is a very considerate person and didn &apos;t get pissed off as much as he could have .
 and now i backup everything religiously ,  so lesson learned without significant lasting damage ,  thankfully .
 2nd  since my comment confused people ,  i &apos;ll explain what happened .
 it needed to upgrade the pc &apos;s firmware ,  and asked me to back up everything before giving it to them ,  since they would wipe the hdd .
 i copied everything to dropbox ,  and once it copied only the subfolders ,  for some reason gave the green tick mark that means copying was done ,  so i didn &apos;t double check and just gave it to them .
 i realized what happened later on ,  and by then they wiped the pc and turned the bits ,  so it was unrecoverable .
 since my fiasco ,  it enacted the policy that they will always backup the hdd of any pc before wiping it
 buy tp ,  bleach ,  hand sanitizer ,  and masks .
 don &apos;t spend money on the stupid stuff i spent it on last time .
 sell stocks at the peak and start my company sooner .
 get in touch with my ob-gyn and tell him my son’s going to be born with a heart condition even though you wouldn’t be able to see anything on the scans at 10 weeks ,  16 weeks ,  20 weeks and 28 weeks .
 get in touch with paediatric cardiologists and specialists and give them as much information as i can remember and hopefully do whatever i can to save his life .
 i’d eat right ,  rest more ,  take care of myself more .
 i’d still accept it if he passed ,  but at least it would make me feel like i had done everything i could .
 thank you everyone for your kind thoughts and words .
 i never expected my comment to get this much attention .
 it was just the first thing on my mind ,  and it’s a desire that’s so true of any parent who’s lost a child that i had to speak it .
 i just wanted to say that i do know i did what i could ,  but it’s so hard to ever step back and admit  .
 “ok ,  i did everything i could” .
 as a parent ,  you just feel compelled to do anything you can ,  even against all human logic .
 i &apos;d tell my dad to go see his doctor .
 he got his cancer diagnosis in may .
 might have had a better shot if they &apos;d found it in january .
 thank you so much for your well wishes ,  kind words and shiny badges ,  friends !
 i &apos;m sorry for not replying to everyone ,  but it &apos;s nearly 3am now and i &apos;ll head to bed .
 my dad is the most stubborn optimist ,  and i &apos;ll just follow his lead .
 thanks again ,  and i hope the kindness you &apos;ve shown me tonight comes back to you .
 forewarn cps of my old childhood best friend and have them check in on her constantly .
 we haven’t been friends/spoken in a few years .
 but she snapped and killed her 6 month old baby this last spring and i would love to spare everyone that pain .
 just like groundhog day ,  eh ?
  well ,  some very bad things will happen to some very bad people .
  and if i get caught ,  who cares ?
  just kill myself in jail like epstein didn &apos;t and start over .
 if i start visiting my brother more often in january .

 stop my little brother from smoking the fentanyl that killed him .
 i would start sewing masks jan 1st .
 as soon as i &apos;m back from lockdown ,  my bf and i request our vacation for the same week ,  three months in advance (his workplace is terrible about granting vacation time) .
 i sign up for skill share ,  and each iteration take a different course .
 be ready for my dogs newly developed seizures ,  cut my boyfriend off from liquor before the pandemic ,  stock up on tp ,  travel ,  visit my family more ,  and prepare all my teaching lessons now that i know the disaster that awaits us .
 but in reality i would probably do nothing ,  procrastinate ,  and let everything turn to shit just like it had because i would be too depressed not to .
 invest in amazon stock & stay at my old job
 invest in n95 masks and hand sanitizer .
 immediately use the disneyland ticket i bought instead of waiting ,  since i should &apos;ve had until may to use it .
 after decades of not caring about disney-related things ,  this is the year i thought  &apos;what the heck !
  &apos; great timing there .
 hope disney is enjoying my money from that unused ticket .
 just not buy the damn ticket this year .
 move to canada and buy zoom and ppe stock .
 move to new zealand
 invest in stocks ,  and make bank off of sports bets
 i have at least four lives to save .
 all else is secondary; save those four .
 everything else pales by comparison .
 sit back ,  and enjoy unus annus with a clear conscience
 sit in the forest alone for most of it and learn about myself .
 not fuck up my friendship and bite my opinionated tongue
 i would make huge bets on what’s going to happen .
 i prepare for covid to get really big .
 i buy as much hand sanitizer as possible .
 i then just wait it out until the end of the year ,  maybe buying large amounts of masks .
 if that happens ,  i won’t lie .
 i will just shoot myself .
 relive unus annus
 tell my sister to stay at home august 29th .
 she was killed by someone who was driving that was high .
 i use my awesome new found powers for good .
 first ,  i look for criminals .
 i tell the world how and when they will die .
 i make it happen ,  even if it wouldn &apos;t .
 i soon decide to become the god of the new world .
 but soon it turns out that there was a great detective on my tail .
 i try to kill him on live tv .
 so begins our game .
 this is as much as i could recall of death note .
 i don’t give a shit get my grades up go back to playing cod
 i tell myself that even though i’m going to have another miscarriage in a month ,  i just need to be able to hold on because i will be adopting my daughter in the summer and she is what is going to make my life beautiful .
 probably just re-budget and prioritize my money in preparation for quarantine .
 stock up on stuff like masks ,  gloves ,  cleaning supplies ,  etc .
 i &apos;m not going to horde that stuff ,  but i am just going to have enough around so i don &apos;t have to deal with the shortages in toilet paper and soap that &apos;s going to happen later on in the year .
 also forgo shopping for new clothes and instead buy myself some workout equipment before they become insanely expensive .
 lastly i &apos;ll probably use the money i saved up to go on a vacation for a switch (i don &apos;t think they were all sold out in january yet ?
 ) and a new gaming pc as well .
 my grandma died in february .
 i &apos;d call her everyday
 overthrow the us government
 inform my family that my sister has pre-symptomatic covid ,  get her hospitalized and isolated asap ,  advise the doctors which meds to try treating her with ,  and get media involved to show there’s community transmitted covid in washington state .
 hopefully turn the tides of infections in my country by getting lockdown started sooner and save my sister from dying a horrible death .
 (for context ,  my sister was an early casualty from covid .
 we didn’t know until after her passing and received a diagnosis weeks after the fact when doctors re-reviewed her lung scans and symptoms based on what we know now .
 i would go on vacation .
 i missed 2019 because my mother was ill (and then died) and we were short staffed at the office all year .
 2020 was supposed to be the year ,  and i was making my plans when covid hit .
 start working from home .
 invest in tesla and zoom .
 get to new zealand as soon as possible .
 cancel my quibi account .

 warn my cousin to quit her job where she caught covid and spread it to her family and caused my aunt to be on a ventilator with 15% chance of survival .
 she was on it for a month and a half ,  called the family for an end of life event ,  pulled through that ,  had to have a tracheotomy put in ,  was in induced coma for most of that time and then 2 weeks with a trach .
  yesterday they took her trach and feeding tube out .
 it looks like she is gonna pull through !
 tell my best friend to not go to florida and ride a parachute ( ?
 ) to celebrate her boyfriend &apos;s birthday .
 cord snap and they fell 30ft .
 her boyfriend died and she &apos;s been in a coma ever since .
 i can &apos;t even go see her because of covid .
 i wish i could be there for her .
 push for more poll workers in pennsylvania ,  georgia ,  arizona  .

 make her wear the mask .
 tore my achilles in august and just had surgery to repair it after re rupturing it .
 i’d stop running ,  start pt ,  and build strength so i don’t have to go through this .
 also enjoy my time with friends and family .
 be better at saving money for when i get laid off .
 everyone in the comments is like  &apos;buy tesla calls &apos; and  &apos;stock up on toilet paper &apos; .
 next thing you know this is some kind of an alternate reality where not all of the same events take place .
 now you &apos;re stuck with $5000 worth of hand sanitizer and toilet paper .
 leave my toxic girlfriend .
 not let politics destroy my happiness .
 take care of my self better .
 kick myself for not knowing any lotto numbers or sport scores ,  then just invest i guess .
 spend every day that i can with my mom .
 she passed away in april .
 i miss her more than anything .
 i see a lot of the same posts and this will probably get lost .
 i found out recently that my husband has felt off about our marriage and after talking i can see what he means .
 i would spend the summer really investing in our marriage and putting more time into it .
 and if it keeps repeating i would hopefully have more and more time to invest in us .
 i don &apos;t know if it would change anything but i hope it would and it would really be the only thing worth investing in .
 on may 25th i carry my healthy and 9 months pregnant wife to the hospital and have every test done so that i could be holding my son right now instead of visiting his grave tomorrow .
 ain &apos;t no salvaging this septic fire
 because of the butterfly effect ,  any thing or situation i could prepare for may never actually happen ,  so that’s a bummer .
 what would i do ?
 have an existential crisis because i’m stuck in a time loop .
 everybody was complaining about them; but now we know their secret .
 nah they would have just gotten a bidet in january
 except on the lip .
 like we really have to deal with two viruses at the same damn time
 the vast majority of people in the world have at least one kind of herpes
 same but different .
 don’t get engaged to that guy ,  don’t buy that house with said guy ,  and fucking wrap your wily self because you’ll become hiv positive .
 it’s not a death sentence anymore comma but is it worth it ?
 is that you megan ?
 i work in healthcare on the business end ,  so i read the nytimes health section pretty much every day .
 they began covering covid in december ,  so i bought some clorox stock in early january just in case .
 invest in toilet paper companies
 is tesla doing that well now ?
 i jokingly told my buddy to buy tesla stocks after the tesla reveal .
 he waited a little too long to go for it .
 correction ,  puts in february ,  calls on fuckin everything after march
 you can make a lot more money instantly by sports betting .
 yeah sure tesla calls will net a pretty penny but betting kobe dies in a helicopter crash as a prop bet will make you an instant millionaire
 buy amd and sell when it hits 90
 i would go with nio ,  moderna ,  novavax stocks
 but would altering one event prevent others from happening ?
 until ,  much like when you cant find something and you ask your mom to find it and then its right there ,  you are completely wrong and no tragedies happen and everyone thinks you &apos;re insane .
 although that means all the deaths and covid didnt happen so .
 this would be awesome ,  until you ended up on a jet ,  that doesn &apos;t exist ,  flying to a place ,  that doesn &apos;t exist ,  to be the guest of a 3 letter government agency ,  that doesn &apos;t exist .
 how are you doing now ?
 holy shit haha .
 i woke up this morning to a bazillion reddit notifications on my phone and had a n x i e t y .
 thanks for all the upvotes and awards you awesome weirdos 3

 putting everything on zoom
 don’t worry ,  i think groundhog day only happens to people making a mess of their lives .
 it feels a lot better .
 here’s a poor man’s award 
 i got one on march 12th .
 i felt like a genius
 i look like tabitha from the ring
 the amount of loss is astonishing .
 losing your dog can be just as devastating as losing a human .
 people that don’t get that haven’t lost the dog .
 it’s been three years ,  and i still ugly cry for her if i think about her for long enough .
 my dad lost the dog in the 60s and he still cries over her ,  man .
 i’m so sorry about your friend .
 i know it hurts .
 as a californian this would be very appreciated
 plot twist ,  they go blow shit up in the desert for fun anyway and the wildfire still happens .
 they are about to reveal ,  you jump out and tell  &apos;stop stop !
 grandma gets startled and knocks a nearby tiki torch over ,  setting a blaze on some nearby leaves .
 you relive this year ten thousand times .
  every time something like this occurs .
 the fires end up being inevitable .
 at the right moment ,  just pop out of the bushes with a fire extinguisher .
 actually the reason it &apos;s taking so long is that nevada by state law accepts mail in ballots that they receive by nov 10 as long as it &apos;s postmarked by nov 3 .
 telling them to start counting in advance won &apos;t change the fact that they technically can &apos;t know the final counting until after a week because of it .
 having a brother i’m close to ,  this hit hard .
 i’m sorry for whatever happened .
 chin up ,  friend .
 my lil bro passed right at the end of 2019 .
 i would give anything to go back and cut that rope to bits .
 speaking as someone who also lost his younger brother/best friend ,  i get it .
 i’d do anything to just give him a hug and say goodbye .
 no one understands the pain you feel losing a sibling .
 if you &apos;re close ,  true friends like my sister and i were ,  its true and utter despair .
 dreams my sister and i are talking about our life .
 i &apos;m telling her all about mine because i always do .
 then ,  when i ask her how things are going ,  she smiles at me looks down at her feet and says to me in a soft caring voice:  &apos;nothing &apos;s going on with me ,  i died 36 years ago .
 i wish i could remember what her voice sounded like .
 i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
 i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
 “and we’d have so much fun” made me cry .
 lost my little (20 months younger) sister last year .
 my brother died from fentanyl overdose in 2016 .
 not a day goes by that he &apos;s not on my mind .
 reaĺly ,  really sorry for your loss .
 sending an internet hug
 keenan and kel music starts playing
 -not take the little things for granted .
 erectile dysfunction must really suck
 i’m so sorry for your loss
 oddly enough ,  i was on the exact opposite side of this ,  i came to a friend asking for help because i was suicidal ,  and they (my best friend of 10 years) abandoned me .
 and all i want is to have them back ,  fuck co-dependence - .
 this is literally my exact situation .
 i’m an american who happened to take a four month trip to new zealand this past january .
 my flight home got cancelled because of covid and i’m still in nz today .
 just got my work visa approved and will be here until nov 2021 .
 still can’t really believe how lucky i got .
 what do i do if i’m already here ?
 this is the right answer .
 i just moved outside u .
 to a warmer destination .
   wish i &apos;d have done so before the actual 2020 began .
 my 2020 plan was to move to nz to be with my girlfriend .
 now we can &apos;t be together until the end of 2021 earliest .
 a do-over would be fucking amazing .
 i had the chance to immigrate to new zealand a few years ago and regret not taking it .
 i had friends who ended their honeymoon to new zealand early to come home before the flights were shut down .
 both of them contracted the virus at work in june .
 thank god they are alright ,  but i can &apos;t imagine they wouldnt of just preferred staying in retrospect .
 yep ,  that’s the first thing i thought of .
 kiwis would be pretty confused with a mass immigration in january
 hey ,  i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
 the bond with a sibling is one of the strongest .
 condolences from a stranger  .
 may he rest in peace .
 likewise my mother .
 i came for the funny replies ,  got hit with the feels
 i too would call my brother ,  he died in september .
 i wish i could give you a hug .
 you &apos;ll get stronger .
 my dad died last month
 i &apos;m sorry to hear .
 i was still in the military in the spring .
 my company commander denied some dude travel to see his dying grandpa because he didn’t feel it was worth going to his own boss’s boss to get an exception to policy memo signed .
 lost my father to cancer this year as well .
 i also vote for this guys mom .
 on a serious note ,  that’s an intensely bleak comment .
 i’m sorry the year went the way it did for you ,  fella .
 catherine tate surprised me at how much i liked her in doctor who .
 when she was first announced i don &apos;t think anyone expected to like her
 donna noble has left the library
 i need to rewatch doctor who fr
 man the saddest part about that episode was when they sent all the foreigners to  &apos;camps &apos;  .
 i miss donna &apos;s dad .
 best character ever
 there’s always “an episode of that” in either dr .
 who ,  star trek ,  or the simpson’s for just about every scenario possible i’ve noticed .
 i need to watch this dr .
 always heard it’s great .
 this made me cry and realise i really need to leave my shitty relationship and find this right here .
 i’m really sorry for your loss .
 sending you lots of love .
 i can’t imagine your pain .
 it hurts just to try .
 but i’ll appreciate my husband more tonight after having read your post than i would have had i not .
 thanks for reminding me to focus on what matters while i can .
 i hope you find peace soon 
 i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
 i just got married and i can &apos;t even imagine losing my husband right now .
 sending internet hugs to you !
  i am so very sorry for your loss .
 i am so very sorry for your loss .
 your husband sounds similar to mine - blue eyes and loves to cook .
 i will make sure to give him an extra hug tonight ,  and extra appreciation always .
 sending you hugs 
 this is one of the most beautiful things i have ever read on this site .
 i &apos;m just some random dude who is now crying on his couch .
 if i can feel how much you love and appreciate your husband i know for a fact he knows it .
 i &apos;m 38 and have been married for 6 years and just had my first child eight months ago .
 every now and then my wife tells me she feels bad because with the new baby she thinks she doesn &apos;t show me how appreciated i am and that all her time and energy goes to our baby .
 i tell her not to worry because i know how she feels about me .
 i can feel how much she loves me .
 and i know that no matter how much time and energy you put into someone you love ,  when they are gone you will always wish it was more .
 so don &apos;t sweat the small stuff ,  your husband knows how you feel .
 i am so very sorry for your loss .
 i  just celebrated my 6th anniversary so i know just how deeply you must have loved each other .
  i don’t know why i decided to look at your other comments but your post about the silence made me start crying .
 i’m sorry u lost your lobster .
 i pray your memories last a very long time .
 fuck ,  my husband and i are around that age ,  this message made me break down in tears .
 i’m so so sorry for your loss ,  i can’t imagine the pain in your heart .
 i’m so sorry ,  i’m hugging you with my soul .
 i’m so sorry :( internet hugs from an internet stranger 
 my grandmother keeps going to church because  &apos;only 100 people are there &apos; like it &apos;s a large church but still .
 would be my answer as well .
 i have no idea how i would accomplish stopping my mom from going to work though .
 she was the most stubborn person i &apos;ve ever known .
 but i would certainly try my hardest .
 i lost a grandfather recently too ,  but unfortunately in my case sometime went to visit my grandparents and got them sick .
 you have my sympathy .
 i’m wiped reading this .
  pulling for you .
 this is the stuff grad school nightmares are made of .
 my dad has a phd ,  was working on his diss back in the 60s .
 no computers ,  of course ,  but they did have carbon paper .
 so he always had a carbon copy of his diss ,  as did his friends .
 they would store their carbons in each other &apos;s refrigerators because that was the most fire-proof place in most people &apos;s houses .
 (we had a friend &apos;s diss in our fridge; he had my dad &apos;s in his .
 when i was doing my diss in the early 90s ,  i had a computer to write it on .
 every time i went to the building my department was in i took a floppy with the latest version stored on it ,  then put it in a locker i had there on the lowest floor .
 that building was an atom bomb shelter and built like a fortress .
 anything that brought it down would be bad enough that losing my diss back-up would be the least of my worries .
 glad to hear you were able to reconstruct the part that hadn &apos;t yet been published ,  but i get the loss you felt .
 there &apos;s two types of people in the world .
 those who backup their data ,  and those who haven &apos;t lost their data .
 what’s your company ?
 i wish you could go back and prevent it all .
 i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
 honestly did not expect to be crying so much in this thread .
 my god ,  i can’t imagine your pain but i’m sending healing hugs and warmth within my soul .
 i’m so sorry for your loss .
 we recently celebrated day of the dead in my culture ,  i didn’t know it then ,  but i lit a candle and put out cake for the little ones that have been lost ,  including your baby boy .
 much love ,  friend
 i’m telling this guy about his dad in hopes of saving him .
 my dad died from a heart attack in january .
 it was very unexpected and idk if there would have been a way to prevent it so at the very least i would have flown home and hung out all month .
 sending positive energy
 sorry to hear that !
 i kinda wish this prompt went back to 2019 then i get to stop my friend from killing his wife then himself .
 it &apos;s been kind of a bummer .
 that is so sad .
 that poor child .
 oh my god i am so so sorry .
 how tragic for the family
 love how casually it’s thrown in .
 what if we are living in one of epsteins discarded realities ?
 don’t blame yourself .
 we often think that there is a singular thing that could have changed an outcome but i found life to be way more complex than that .
 wow ,  in all honesty i feel that .
 i’m a young adult ,  but this is the hardest year of my life that i’ve ever had .
 not just personally ,  but for so many people around me and around the world .
 i’ve never seen so much hurt ,  pain ,  tragedy ,  desperation ,  or divide .
 albeit there’s been many firsts for me this year and i’ve definitely have seen improvements in many parts of my life ,  it’s painful to see the effects of covid and the other events of 2020 has had on us .
 so yeah ,  i’d probably cry too !
 i don’t think any of us need to go through another year like 2020 .
 though ,  i do have hope that there will be great things that come as result of this year .
 i mean ,  all you really have to do is plan a visit .
 get there before lockdown ,  and you’re golden .
 you think it takes 4 months for immigration to process your application ?
 avoid contact with that person i later found out was positive .
 i didn &apos;t catch it ,  but having to get another test was annoying .
 i wouldn’t bother investing in stuff ,  it’s like groundhog day remember ?
  it’s gonna keep sending you back once you get to the end of the year .
  although perhaps the mask is a good idea ,  just in case any virus in you ,  comes back with you ,  mutating slightly over the thousands and millions of years until you  !
 finally manage to love someone !
  guys ,  have you even looked at the amazon stock price this year ?
  it barely doubled .
  whilst an excellent return in normal circumstances ,  it’s an terrible gain for someone with knowledge of the future ,  just bet on a sports game you remember or something ,  you’ll get more and won’t have to wait 6 months .
 correction tsla calls
 you have the biggest brain ever
 honestly ,  there were plenty of people saying that it was about to get bad .
 they were just being ignored .
 really ,  people who study pandemics have been pretty accurately predicting what &apos;s going to happen .
 i don &apos;t need to be another voice doing that .
 i &apos;d definitely take that vacation we considered in february .
 and also do the things to make money in the stock market .
 i am so sorry ,  fentanyl has killed so many people far too young
 zoom went up around 500%
  who did you lose ?
 i ask this same question when i wondered if i could save the challenger .
  who can you call ?
  if nasa isn &apos;t even listening to it &apos;s engineers ,  would they listen to a layman ?
 it &apos;s not like kobe &apos;s chopper would have crashed b/c of some mechanical failure ,  so there wouldn &apos;t be a thing to detect or come across to prove your point when it doesn &apos;t crash .
 call in a bomb threat at the basketball court .
 no more game to fly to
 omg ,  that happened this year ?
 feels like years ago .
 also ,  if possible ,  save chadwick
 damn that feels like it was a decade ago .
 but you &apos;d have to shoot yourself forever .
 it &apos;s a groundhog day loop .
 i &apos;m sorry for your loss man .
 i can &apos;t imagine what i &apos;d do if i lost one of my sisters .
 i wish i had more to say ,  some way to help ,  but i don &apos;t .
 so i &apos;ll just extend this invitation .
 if you ever want to talk ,  feel free to message me .
 even if it &apos;s just rambling or nonsense it &apos;s okay with me .
 it &apos;s good to get it out and i won &apos;t judge ,  and will always be willing to respond and try to help any way i know how .
 i hope you and your sister can both find peace .
 i could go into detail about it but i &apos;d rather you rewatch death note
 everyone should watch death note .
 encourage other people to watch it too .
 it f &apos;d my husband up .
 now he refers to random ,  twisted scenarios as ,   &apos;like that death note sht .
 followed by even more call options
 and wake up again on january 1st ,  2020 .
 they all had chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and finally saw the chance to buy hundreds of dollars worth of tp without it seeming odd .
 or they &apos;re secretly a part of an underground group of people who are addicted to tp &apos;ing neighborhood front yards .
 we got ours in february and had done a costco tp run a week before shut down .
 i think i used up years worth of luck with that move
 i had to deal with two .
 i cancelled my appointment to start prep (which prevents you from contracting hiv) in march i was negative and in july i tested hiv positive .
  covid fucked my life up in a huge way .
 i &apos;m not even kidding .
 i &apos;m just glad it &apos;s not 1980 and i caught it t early .
 there &apos;s no change to my lifespan but having to tell sex partners and the stigma that still exists really sucks .
 right now it &apos;s one pill a day to keep it in check and be undetectable .
 but do it with a condom on .
 lol but playing the sad tromboner .
 something like 90% of people have one or the other just don &apos;t show signs of it
 isnt genital herpes the same as the one on the lip ?
 like if somebody has mouth herpes and goes down on someone it transmits as genital herpes
 people should really stop worrying about herpes so much .
 its a skin condition ,  a large amount of people have it and avoiding it is only down to luck unless you never plan to kiss anyone ever again
 i was following the riots in hong kong and it was on those boards that people started talking about  &apos;a mysterious virus making people sick .
  &apos; yet everyone says that there is no way anyone would know what was happening back in late november/early december .
 same pretty much ,  minus the investing ,  and cause of an autoimmune problem ,  i haven &apos;t been working .
  we did however stock up on toilet paper ,  bleach wipes ,  soap ,  and essentials in mid-february ,  and that same month decided to just go out for absolutely essential services only .
  sadly that means i haven &apos;t been to a restaurant since october of 2019 and i &apos;m really craving proper sushi bad ,  but it also means that i haven &apos;t gotten covid .
  when i saw the news in december about a novel respiratory disease in china the red flags already kicked off and i was forewarning any family that would listen to keep an eye on it .
 give us the numbers boss
 i know a guy who made almost $50k this year off tesla - he’s a long term investor so he’s been in for years but this year his investment paid off in spades
 before more people correct without looking at the very next comment ,  it’s 500% what it was in january .
 i was under the impression the 86 dollars was true value and not taking in to account the 1-5 split
 would make you hella sus tho
 can you just bet that a celebrity dies by a very specific way ?
 i mean kobe is known for riding in helicopters ,  but who do you make that bet with ?
 lol wow sick 80% gain .
 off the top of my head nio was one of the better stocks this year ,  just checked and its over 1500% gain ytd .
 not when you could buy nio  leaps and fds all year and make 10 , 000% or more .
 events like storms can &apos;t be prevented
 wasn &apos;t there just a mathematical proof about time travel to the past ?
 if it is possible ,  they showed that major events will still happen anyway ,  to avoid paradoxes .
 basically that real life is like the terminator universe .
 time travel is possible but it can &apos;t change things in the future .
 those things will always find a way to happen .
 nah ,  you just tell people the truth ,  that you &apos;re an enlightened time traveler .
 once things diverge too much you say that your goal is complete ,  x many lives saved ,  ect .
 enjoy your cult
 thanks for asking !
 i &apos;m tired ,  all the time .
 i have no energy for either school ,  spending time with friends or simple stuff like cooking or cleaning .
 i &apos;m about to drop out/pause my studies to move back home so i can focus on my health .
 i thought i could handle school but i can &apos;t :( .
 and to clarify i have some special chronic kidney disease called ahus at stage 5 so i have to do dialysis until i get a new kidney .
 actually ,  you’d be far better off with a few penny stocks .
 i suggest getting into codx ,  novacyt ,  and a few others prior to their breaking 30 cents .
 i was watching others in february ,  but was too chicken shit to jump on them .
 hit me up at the tail end of february and i’ll hook you up .
 well ,  at least my top rated comment isn’t my drawing attention to a puppy penis in a r/aww post anymore .
 shove all your money into zoom ,  appl ,  tsla ,  and nio calls .
 285 puts in january with end of march expiration .
 then switch to 340 calls .
 at $1 contract as they were worth $ .
 01per lots of 100  i could have gotten 25000-40 , 000 contracts and gotten a return of 7-16 million on the first side .
 and then infinite money after that .
 so why hasn &apos;t it happened to me yet ?
 i thought during that week  &apos;aaah it can wait til next week &apos; .
 wasn’t samara her name ?
 hahaha thanks i just laughed pretty hard at this .
 oregon also sends their appreciation
 as a californian that had that particular fire occur less than five minutes away from me ,  i would also appreciate this .
 but this time it is 10x as bad !
 not that i disagree but how does this relate to the comment you replied to .
 i know you would .
 he loved you and he knew you loved him .
 much love friend
 april 2nd turned into a f &apos;d up day
 so the dreams don &apos;t go away ?
 i have incredibly vivid dreams talking to him .
 i throw myself at him and wrap my arms around .
 i can see the tone of his skin and smell him .
 i tell him over and over and over how much i love him and wish things were different .
 i had 1000 opportunities to change that weekend .
 he experienced his burden and this is mine .
 i &apos;m sure he &apos;d feel the same .
 i dont have an award to give .
 here &apos;s a baguette .
 thanks kind strangers ,  i can now afford to give the silver award .
 i miss them dearly ,  but i was grateful to have them in my life
 are you doing okay man ?
 suicide is rough on everyone involved and i wish there were methods to prevent it ,  yet we never truly can
 my grandfather says almost every day that he wants to die ,  he’s going senile also and in a lot of pain from what he says .
 i just say “grandpa don’t say that .
 ” but deep down i am really afraid he might do something like not take his insulin or his pills wether or not he forgets .
 he used to be so sweet ,  he’s bitter now but some days he still has that sparkle in his eye and the pep in his walk that he once did .
 if they left you ,  they were never your best friend .
 it’s a good thing they’re gone .
 and you are about to experience a beautiful long hot summer while your peeps back home will be freezing their asses off .
 fuuuuck that &apos;s so dope .
 this totally put a smile on my face .
 every time i go on vacation i always think ,  “ooo ,  what if something crazy happens and we have to stay here for months ?
 ” you’re living an actual dream of mine 
 are you sure you didn &apos;t see this thread and hop back in time ?
 make the most of it ,  and have an amazing time !
 just got my work visa approved and will be here until nov 2021 .
 i &apos;m curious ,  how complicated is that ?
 what type of work will you be doing ?
 embrace the lifestyle but take advantage of the internet to make money .
  play rugby in the afternoon ,  commit cyber crime in the evening .
  so basically ,  haka by day ,  hacker by night .
 invest in real estate .
 having to stay overseas longer than anticipated can quickly turn expensive
 my doctor used to tell me and my sister(because we never got along) that your siblings are the closest thing to you genetically and no one else knows what you’ve been through like your sibling does .
 so cherish each other .
 that commander is a piece of shit .
 the stop movement memo hurt a lot of us .
 stories like this one breaks my heart though .
  our co said if we put in a request to leave the area for pretty much anything that he &apos;d route it .
  we had a guy go out of state to get married .
 that’s when i’d break the chain of command and immediately head to his boss ,  or even the boss after .
 i’m a girl actually ,  and your comment did make me exhale from my nose so thank you for that as well
 only to have the heartbreaking doctor donna farewell .
 that episode still makes me feel hollow
 i feel like she gets a lot of hate ,  but she’s my fav companion .
 bill was cool ,  too .
 tbf i don &apos;t think you were really supposed to like her in her first appearance .
 she &apos;s fairly abrasive in it .
 i certainly didn &apos;t ,  yet here we are .
  donna noble gang 4 lyfe .
 donna noble has been saved .
 donna noble has been saved .
 my heart still aches for donna’s fictional marriage and children .
 wilf is a fucking treasure .
 he was only in about five or six episodes ,  sometimes only appearing for a few minutes ,  but he &apos;s my second favorite davies era companion .
 his little relationship with the doctor was probably my favorite on the show ,  and the scene where their destinies come to a head is also one of my favorite scenes .
 i need to watch this dr .
 always heard it’s great .
 just remember ,  it doesn &apos;t actually take itself very seriously ,  and the sfx budget is not high .
 i am so sorry for you and for her .
 sending you hugs .
 take time with your grief .
 i know most folks think the opposite ,  but sit with your grief ,  let it in so completely that you almost start to nurture it .
 let your grief become a part of who you are .
 send it ,  in the form of love ,  with your wife on whatever journey she &apos;s on now .
 you cannot complete your journey with her .
 i so ,  so much ,  wish that you could .
 you also cannot complete your journey with your grief .
 so hold it while you can ,  like all the times you held her hand .
 kiss your grief goodnight ,  like you want to do with the woman you love .
 let it grow (without overtaking you) until it can be set free .
 grief has a role to play in all of our lives .
 big grief and small grief and all the in-between .
 i know it hurts ,  but don &apos;t look away from it .
 in fact ,  hang on to it a little .
 just enough to let it grow into hope that then can be pushed out of the nest of your life .
 no religion ,  no science ,  no institution of learning knows what happens when we die .
 the best we can do is sit in silence ,  and in rage ,  and in despair ,  and in ecstasy ,  with the two sides of the coin we are given .
 so let your grief in .
 claim it and honor it as you claim and honor and love your wife .
 because she is the opposite side of this coin of grief .
 do not diminish it .
 source: a woman that has mourned her son
 this hurts my heart .
 i hope that you are as okay as one can be .
 i am so sorry for your loss .
  sending you lots of warm internet hugs .
 i was once in this position 8 years ago ,  i knew the relationship i was in wasn &apos;t one of real love ,  and i wasn &apos;t living who i was in my heart .
 it &apos;s been 7 years since i first met my fiance after i dumped my ex after finding out he had cheated on me with many other women ,  and i finally feel that way .
 i feel like if soul mates are real ,  he &apos;s mine .
 and if they &apos;re not ,  he &apos;s still my favorite person in the universe ,  and we make each other better people .
 it is possible ,  there is hope !
 i am in the middle of counseling a friend’s ex .
 wish i had gotten to know her better during the years they were dating .
 i would have urged her to leave years sooner than she did .
 now she has so much baggage ,  poor thing .
 she’s working through it though .
 good luck to you .
 thank you ,  i appreciate it .
 stay safe and don &apos;t sweat the small stuff .
 thank you ,  i appreciate the internet hugs !
 sending one back .
 enjoy your journey with your new husband .
 i wish you both a lifetime of happiness .
 dont sweat the small stuff .
 that’s around the age that my cousin’s cousin died from covid last month .
 he was young ,  healthy .
 he was married for a few years and just had his baby for a few months .
 after he passed away ,  his brother died a few weeks later from the same damn virus .
 the family had to wait weeks for any memorial service because there are too many deaths around here .
 i knew the family from get togetherness ,  but it hit my cousin very hard .
 they’re all similar age and very close .
 life is precious .
 it’s the most valuable thing .
 tell me about it .
 i work at a convention center and am forced to work as hundreds of people gather and dance for weddings and other events .
 we have a church with about 150 right now that shows up every weekend .
 they’re all hugging and shit like nothing is going on .
  meanwhile we advertise as being the safest place to host an event .
 it’s all bullshit though and i feel incredibly unsafe .
 but most of the work was already published ,  but it would &apos;ve been nice to keep the source code .
 there was one unpublished work that was wiped ,  but i managed to rewrite it from memory ,  and got that published 2 months ago thankfully .
 but definitely a lesson for the future !
 my biggest worry was what my professor would think .
 thankfully he &apos;s a chill dude ,  he did say i had to rewrite the unpublished part ,  but he was not worried about the published stuff getting wiped .
 he had something similar happen to him during his phd so he sympathized lol
 my dad has a phd ,  was working on his diss back in the 60s .
 who was he dissing ?
 was he trying to start a beef with feynman or something ?
 a tip for anyone who saves revisions of major documents: get into the habit of saving with a new filename regularly .
 that way you can always revert to another copy if you really mess up or if the file gets corrupted .
 don &apos;t use  &apos;new &apos; or  &apos;final &apos; ,  just increment the number each time .
 saving to google drive ,  even under the same filename ,  will also automatically do this for you .
 i once rescued several weeks of work for someone who found that their enormous indesign file wasn &apos;t opening and was showing as zero bytes .
 they had been saving it to google drive and the previous revision was still intact .

 i love this comment
 i &apos;m so ,  so sorry .
 i wish you could have flown back home ,  too .
 although this year feels like a nightmare for us ,  i know we &apos;re so incredibly lucky to have whatever time we have .
 i hope you have someone by your side for when things feel unbearable .
 thank you ,  that &apos;s very kind .
 this might be the first time i see someone refer to a good ol &apos; murder suicide as  &apos;kind of a bummer &apos; .
 also really sorry for your loss
 i love to casually throw that in random places .
  before i insulated a part of my basement i wrote  &apos;epstein didn &apos;t kill himself &apos; on a random 2x4 .
 this is probably going to freak out or confuse someone in the future .
 i &apos;m dressing up as bret from flight of the conchords and sneaking in .
 submit the application while on holiday there .
 stupid lock downs and being stuck ,  darn
 going through that right now .
 friend tested positive yesterday ,  got my test done this morning and now i’m waiting .
 really messed up my plans for the weekend cause i don’t wanna leave my place and chance giving it to others .
 oh wow ,  thanks for the award !
 didn’t expect this !
 have a good weekend guys !
 i feel like noone in this thread has actually watched groundhog day .
 if you invest in zoom or amazon ,  the returns will be enough that by the end of the year you will be able to enjoy the money ,  even if you lose it at the end
 i’d bet on georgia and arizona both going blue ,  that early in the year i’d get insane odds .
 will work great until (s)he forgets to shake hands .
 i had one professor who was like on it and talking about it quite a bit before it got bad .
 he kept thinking it was going to be much bigger than we imagined and turns out he was right .
 it’s crazy how everything has happened since then .
 that was in february and feels like it was years ago .
 most recently i lost a friend of mine; i helped him get a job with the company i was working at ,  and things were good .
 but now he &apos;s gone ,  and we couldn &apos;t have a funeral for him because of covid ,  and i want to help his father somehow ,  but can &apos;t ,  because of covid .
 i haven &apos;t even been over to his gravesite yet; i know what i want to do when i get there ,  but i haven &apos;t figured out what i want to say .
 he loved ants ,  though ,  and he had a symbol that he used to represent himself ,  and some of my dearest memories of him are when we &apos;d go hang out at waffle house after work ,  so i want to go pour that symbol on his grave in syrup and leave it for the ants .
 i know he isn &apos;t there; i know he was cremated ,  but .
 i think he &apos;d appreciate that .
 i just don &apos;t know what to say .
 call in bomb threat or some serious threat from a very serious number .
 if police come after you for false reporting then embrace the moment and act like the paranoid psycho who was trying to save a basketball players life because you had visions of the future .
 i typed very  &apos;serious number  &apos; meaning something untraceable but i find it funny so it stays
 saving the challenger/saving kobe/preventing 9/11 - they &apos;re all easy tasks - the tough task would be to do it so that people either don &apos;t notice you did it ,  or praise you as a hero .
 i could easily go to jail preventing all these things .
 - sabotage a few choppers where kobe took off .
 - fire a high powered rifle at the launchpad the night before the challenger takes off delaying the launch ,  then while in custody ,  rant about o rings and demand they talk to the handful of experts who knew it was basically doomed from the start .
 - call in threats or tips about the hijackers on 9/11 and expect a likely  &apos;how did you know this ?
  &apos; trace if successful .
 alternatively ,  buy tickets and assemble a team to cause a ruckus before takeoff ,  exposing the hijackers .
 since you &apos;re getting low level security involved ,  the idea that 9/11 was an inside job would be moot as those guys wouldn &apos;t have been in on it .
 we &apos;d be taken in ,  the hijackers would be exposed (pre-9/11 ,  middle eastern people were still treated somewhat suspiciously - in this case ,  pointing out how the modeling clay ,  wires ,  and boxcutters are not travel implements .
 unfortunately chadwick had been battling cancer since before the start of 2020 .
 so i guess time to start studying medicine with your infinite 2020 loops and find a cure for colon cancer
 noble ,  but in the end pointless .
 he had been fighting the cancer for a few years and he had been getting gradually weaker with time ,  you can notice it in his size/shape in endgame and infinity war .
 he was taken suddenly ,  but honestly there wouldn &apos;t be much to do but hurry the production of black panther 2 and get marvel studios to make some cgi chadwick while they still have the real deal as a visual reference
 he didn &apos;t say he would sell it
 much like phil ,  then i &apos;d realize that there &apos;s probably a reason .
 honestly ,  you &apos;re remembering everything .
 i wouldn &apos;t want to remember what killing myself a bunch of different ways was like .
 if that happens ,  keep doing it ?
 okay ,  time-traveler ,  whatever you say .
 i got a severe respiratory illness in december and also january ,  it was going around the midwesr at that time ,  but not covid .
 really brutal though .
 knocked me on my ass for like 2 weeks each time
 yeah ,  following the riots led us right into several “china virus” subs before covid had a name and there were so many of us watching and waiting and paranoid and then it finally hit our shores and everyone here was so shocked .
 why were they surprised ?
 it was spreading like wildfire in china ,  they were chaining people in their apartments ,  people lived on nothing but ramen for weeks cause they couldn’t get out .
 but we were surprised that somehow someone brought it out to every other country ?
 every government should’ve been ready for it .
 also ,  i heard back in february that a high school friend had passed away after a trip to s .
 he came home with some “unknown respiratory virus” that they couldn’t get under control and ended up not making it .
 if i remember correctly this was the beginning of january-so before they even fessed up to our first us case ,  but what else could it have been ?
 if i woke up up on 1/1/2020 again ,  knowing what i know now ,  i’d have listened to myself when i thought about buying up food and gloves and stuff .
 even though i did fine during the whole lockdown ,  it would’ve been nice to be able to help some friends that didn’t have it so easy .
 i doubled down ,  up 252% today .
 glad you still came out ahead though - no matter what ,  that’s a win .
 i’m playing a 5-yr+ plan so tolerate volatility a little different than others .
 i remember listening about that  &apos;mysterious flu &apos; in china back in january ,  man wtf who would &apos;ve thought it would come to this .
 invest in zoom the penny stock .
 had a way bigger increase in evaluation because people didn’t know  that it wasn’t the “real” zoom
 invest in every sanitary and paper product and in every videochat service i possibly can

 pick the other zoom ,  not the one everyone started using as that’s the one that had its stock prices increase massively

 what blood type and where are you located ,  if you don &apos;t mind me asking .
 i was planning on going to donate blood and see if i qualify for organ donation and blood marrow donation to help someone else out .
 i’d buy as many calls on tsla as i could afford .
 i’d sell all my shit and use it to buy as many options as possible and waaaaayyyy over leverage myself .
 smh ,  i was about to screenshot this is if i were actually gonna go back to start of 2020
 it only happens to people who have a shot at getting things right
 cuz deep down you’re really doing good !
 it &apos;s flexible depending on the scenario .
 in the movie it &apos;s 24 hours .
 in op &apos;s premise it &apos;s one year .
 in your case it takes 67 .
 23 years to complete a cycle and you &apos;re still on the first one so you don &apos;t know yet .
 and when you wake up at the beginning it &apos;s going to be a couple of years until you start remembering this has happened before .
 by age 8 on the replay they &apos;ll have institutionalized you for your  &apos;insane &apos; rantings about knowing the future ,  it &apos;s really quite a shame .
 i intentionally delayed because of the pandemic .
 you see ,  i had this mistaken idea that we &apos;d be in lockdown for a couple weeks ,  it &apos;d go away ,  and we could go back to normal .
 i usually get a haircut once every 3-4 weeks .
 after three months ,  i finally bought a pair of clippers and ended up buzzing my hair .
 it &apos;s been buzzed since about may .
 i don &apos;t like the look of it at all ,  but it &apos;s way more comfortable than just letting it grow .
 scary movie is tabutha .
 and washington state .
 thank goodness you figured it out .
 i thought my comment might &apos;ve been too edgy !

 i have a little brother who was my best friend .
 i moved away for college and live in another state now .
 we only text when he needs something on amazon lol
 they become more infrequent but in my experience ,   no ,  they don &apos;t go away entirely .
 they were once nightmares to me but i &apos;ve learn to recognize and control dreams to a small degree .
 so now ,  i kind of relish them a bit .
 i can manifest pictures of my kids and grandchild to show her .
 i tell her to keep an eye on them .
 if it really is her in some sense ,  she seems to like that but i don &apos;t know .
 could just be my fragmented brain making sense of what i &apos;m doing .

 not that dreamy .
 our 10th anniversary vacation was a trip to hawaii .
 returning flight was supposed to be 9/11 .
  &apos;vacation &apos; got extended a few days .
 at least we had a place to stay .
 not really complicated just a very long process .
 i applied back in july and just heard back this week .
 you do have to get a medical assessment but the application itself is pretty straight forward .
 depends of what country you’re from though .
 it’s a working holiday visa valid for one year ,  and you can do basically any work you want on it .
 i did not realize this was my true life &apos;s dream until you put it so perfectly !

 not if you &apos;re starting the year fresh and dump your savings in zoom stock .
 bet he felt so strong and powerful showing that soldier who &apos;s boss !
 nobody &apos;s grandpa is more important than the team !
 many of them are .
 the bogus nonsense about military leadership is way over-sold .
 do i sense dissention in the ranks ?
 you’re welcome girl fella
 she gets so much character development ,  she really becomes a better ,  more fulfilled person ,  and the tragedy of doctor donna is that that all goes away .
 you have no idea how much i cry over her loosing her memories to this day .
 it really breaks me everytime .
 anyways happy cake day !
 i’d rate it as one of the most emotional episodes i’ve seen on a tv show ,  honestly .
 i was so surprised by donna’s development ,  and she loved it so much ,  and then that ending  .
 it’s both the worst and the best .
 i still feel betrayed ,  and i both hate and love the episode .
 the doctor donna farewell was probably the most heartbreaking thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
 donna was depressed throughout her whole life ,  she never felt important and she felt betrayed by everyone .
 then this man ,  in a weird box ,  takes her off to far off places we can only dream of having .
 then ,  she becomes ,  in his own words  &apos;the most important woman in the entire universe &apos; ,  for that one shiny spectacular moment .
 but yet ,  it &apos;s all gone ,  because her consciousness got infected .
 all her memories with him ,  all her happiness and joy ,  gone and never to come back .
 she is back to feeling depressed ,  hateful ,  and jaded .
 she knew this too ,  which is why she so heavily refused to do it .
 catherine tate was probably my favorite companion out of everyone ,  simply because it was the peak of russel t .
 davis &apos; writing ,  and my god does it show .
 the friendship she and 10 created was fantastic .
 and it was fantastic that they established very early that this will not be a will they won &apos;t they situation .
 it was two adults ,  opposite genders who were going to be each other &apos;s buddy at the some of the lowest points of their lives .
 there hasn &apos;t been a companion i haven &apos;t liked
 also my favorite .
 i choke up just thinking about her .
 so much fun and so much depth .
 that’s what i liked about her .
 it was a nice change of pace from companions fawning over the doctor .
 she was pretty bovversome ,  tbh .
 she ended up having the best character arc .
 who turned out the lights ?
 but when it does try to take itself seriously ,  it often nails it (van gogh ,  the library ,  angels take manhattan ,   &apos;i don &apos;t want to go &apos; .
 jesus ,  rewriting an entire paper from memory is extremely impressive .
 i can &apos;t even remember what half my code does 2 months out ,  despite being very verbose with comments .
 i’m so proud of you !
 actually ,  his diss was on reinhold niebuhr ,  the liberal theologian ,  most famous for writing the serenity prayer but also the thinker who laid out important principles of nonviolent resistance that gandhi adapted for india and dr .
 martin luther king for the american south .
 i wish that the redditors who conceive of christians only as magical-thinking conservatives knew more about the tradition of liberal christianity that niebuhr represented so well .

 keep in mind it may take a bit for the virus to become present enough to make you test positive .
 honestly ,  i would play it safe and cancel your plans this weekend ,  try again next weekend if you remain asymptomatic
 thank you for being considerate !
 thanks for being a good person and sacrificing your plans to slow the spread of this virus
 because eventually you &apos;ll find love and change and become a better person !
 but why cant you still turn a profit at the same time ?
 real pro-tip is to buy the other stock ,  zoom technologies ,  which experiences much more dramatic gains as people get confused about which stock is which .
 shit ,  how have honourable betting men been sealing the deal this whole time during rona ?
 so i want to go pour that symbol on his grave in syrup and leave it for the ants .
 that is really something .
  what a great idea .
 life keeps going on with all the normal tragedies and on top of it we get covid that doesn &apos;t allow us to support each other nor grieve as we should .
 please take care of yourself the best you can .
  it sounds like you are going through something so heart breaking .
 but would it get taken seriously ?
  the helicopter was at a major airport .
  would they just search it and find nothing and take off anyway and just chalk it up to knuckleheads ?
 longest year of our  lives .
 hey we should make a movie about this .
 did people really seriously think i was being serious and not making a reference to the movie literally referenced in the op &apos;s post ?
 that could &apos;ve saved me the hassle of postponing my wedding twice
 i almost made that exact mistake .
 was it actually a scooter company based out of some guy &apos;s garage in palo alto ?
 i feel this would get you picked up by like cia or some shit
 you want to be in the zoom where it happens ?
 honorable mention to sen .
 kelly loeffler ,  whose husband is the chairman of nyse ( !

 there’s others too i can’t remember .

 i haven &apos;t had my hair cut since february .
 getting pretty long now .
 i missed the boat on long hair in my teenage years so i &apos;m using this opportunity to have a midlife crisis .
 my hair has the exact look of someone who has never cut hair before just trying to cut off the dead ends .
 thank god for punk rock or i &apos;d look even more awful lol
 idk i think it &apos;s more impressive you remembered her as tabitha
 i want to add bc and alberta to that list
 i literally cannot use the internet without ublock origin anymore .
 it is the single greatest extension to be created .
 i used to have adblock plus but after using both i realized it &apos;s not nearly as good as ublock origin .
 highly recommend it .
 i had a phase like that with my bro .
 it &apos;s okay to go on separate paths but please ,  for me ,  call him tomorrow .
 tell him how much you love him and miss the days of being his best friend .
 make plans to visit .
 i &apos;m so lucky my brother decided to move in with me in december .
 his last 6 months were by my side .
 i only wish i set aside more time to play ball ,  go camping ,  gamble ,  whatever ,  anything .
 i &apos;d do anything for one more memory .
 you never know when it &apos;ll be the last you share together .
 their anniversaries (6 and 9 months) are coming up here shortly and i’m not particularly ready for it if that makes sense .
 every month my friend and i go and visit them but this one will be hard because one of their parents just killed themselves over losing their child ,  so i have that funeral to look forward to .
 maybe his plants back home are dope too .
 and now his entire unit hates him .
 yes ,  exactly this .
 she’s the ultimate best friend ,  calling 10 on his bullshit but also a huge supporter .
 and i just found her character to be very relatable—down on her luck ,  not sure what to do with her life ,  feelings of inadequacy and not without faults ,  but genuinely just wanting to do what’s right but also to do something that matters .
 her arch is heartbreaking ,  but i appreciated the depth they gave to her ,  and what she brought to the companion/show dynamic .
 you just want to mate ?
 i can’t see him do that little salute without tearing up !
 or anything really .
 i just want to hug him so damn badly .
 oh yeah that was my favorite thing about her .
 but am i bovvered ?
 is this my bovvered face tho ?
 and absolutely the most tragic ending .
 rose got trapped off in another universe ,  but she has a doctor clone .
 martha gets rose &apos;s ex-boyfriend .
 amy and rory get stuck in the past .
 clara i forget what happens .
 bill technically dies .
 i &apos;m a little bit behind on the rest of them .
 donna starts off really abrasive and stuck on herself .
 goes through several seasons of character growth and development and becomes a lovable character by the end .
 then has to have her memory wiped and forget absolutely every single bit of the character development .
 that is by far the saddest ending of all the companions i &apos;ve seen so far .
 are you my mummy ?
 honestly after watching through the smith years and falling in love with river song ,  going back to that one ,  i cry so hard every time .
 you just described what a real programmer is
 haha ,  much appreciated !
 well it is my last name too ,  so i guess we are more common than you thought .
 no offence ,  i &apos;d hate to have  &apos;consulting &apos; as a last name
 write infernal gibberish and chicken scratch .
 the few legible words should be things like “die” ,  “leave” ,  and “get out of my house” .
 also maybe hide a creepy doll in the wall .
 you mean isolate for fourteen days if you’ve been exposed .
 this is why it’s such a shit show ,  you don’t have to have symptoms to kill someone .
 i always am ,  one way or the other .
 either call it in for the event and include all the details and a half believable plan and include how you &apos;d love to hurt the kids (details which i &apos;m sure you could find out online beforehand ,  etc .
 or call it in that you know someone sabotaged the heli because of some grudge or fight you witnessed them whatever .
 either way it will delay him a few hours and that could have allowed for better visibility or something of that nature .
 call the airport and report the pilot a drinker .
 they have to test them no ?
 throwing off the trail ,  i see .
 since it super jumped in value ,  was it really a mistake ?
 cia guy ,  i just love plexiglass and plexiglass accessories
 but what’s their proof ?

 all one would have to do is deny ,  deny ,  deny and they would theoretically be fine

 my wife needs a kidney ,  and we might be able to swap donors (i can’t give to her) !
 i’m more than happy to give you mine ,  if you find one for her !

 i hope someone in the family tests for you and is a match !
 you &apos;re welcome :-)

 my dad tried that .
 when i showed him a picture of james may he scowled and my mom cackled .
 i loved tabitha and samara in sister ,  sister
 thats dope for the neighbors
 well you’re not mating with me ,  sunshine
 my wife still gets chills every time i say this with that voice 
 are you my mummy ?
 my mistake was watching the capaldi christmas special with river then watching the library episodes immediately after .
 “you showed up at my door in a new suit” sob
 sometime i wonder why i even comment .
 it’s like i’m a different person .
 thank god i no longer code lol
 you guys better chizek yourselves ,  before you wrizek yourselves .
 why are you talking to your alt account ?
 get back to work ,  chizek !
 imagine some day you have to break those walls and you realize that nothing that you wrote is there and that the doll is missing
 i can neither confirm nor deny anything else
 depends on if you held it until after the news stories about it being the wrong stock or not .
 i tell you what .
 just like denmark is doing with minks !
 i think i understand now .
 the cheerleader was a butterfly this whole time .
 i do not have one yet but i think we &apos;re about to start testing early next year
 feel like there should be a kodk or htz in there somewhere ,  if only for the memes
 he’s probably just jealous of the james may’s glorious hair
  &apos;are you my mummy ?
 that &apos;s a fun one to explain to someone who doesn &apos;t watch doctor who .
 that is full on the worst isn &apos;t it .
 that episode gets me too .
 my name is /u/unexpectedhamilton ; .
 and there &apos;s a million awards i haven &apos;t won .
 i love all of you

 how awesome ,  i love reddit and the amazing things that happen here .
 good luck for both of you !
 this thread is amazing
 would be very cool .
 don &apos;t forget the hottest new stock nio .
 actually doing well for a lot of people right now haha .
 but i will be forever grateful that moffat but a bow on that & let us see it instead of having to wait for big finish to do it .
 capaldi’s smirk before “hello sweetie” as river is ranting about him not giving a damn about her & not being in it with her .
 i’m at your service sir .
 yes ,  jag hör av mig !
 imagine this is actually going to happen in real life .
 i &apos;d like to keep up with the story !
 i have been ,  looking for you
 i don’t understand it ,  but i feel it’s wholesomeness
 wishing you the best and i &apos;d love to hear the updates !
 sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time .
 about ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke .
 they didn &apos;t expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright .
 which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye .
 (not total ,  just peripheral .
 ) so she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye .
 so after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license .
 (required by law in my province of canada) .
 my father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so i pack them both up in my truck and take them to the dmv .
 me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass .
 aside from her vision issues ,  the amazingly quick witted and swift woman i grew up with was very unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions .
 it broke my heart and it didn &apos;t even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back .
 well she did ,  passed with  &apos;flying colors &apos; the dmv guy said .
 as a sar (search and rescue) tech ,  the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me .
 1 week later ,  accident number one .
 t-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store .
 not much damage and no injuries thankfully .
 mother still refused to admit she wasn &apos;t fit to drive .
 month later ,  accident 2 .
 she panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car .
 still won &apos;t admit any issues .
 at this point i &apos;m amazed i didn &apos;t have ulcers .
 shortly after accident 2 my father passed away .
 i did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license .
 she wouldn &apos;t do it and for the next few months i spent every day with a knot in my stomach until i spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was  &apos;home from running around &apos;  .
 then around 1pm i get a call from her cell phone ,  this phone i bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it .
 i couldn &apos;t understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone .
 i managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there .
 upon arriving there are two ambulances ,  shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb .
 she &apos;s sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and i &apos;m terrified she &apos;s killed someone .
 turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road ,  began to cross on the cross walk and she didn &apos;t see them .
 she thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn &apos;t super seriously injured .
 because of my job i knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car .
 by the time i had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying .
 threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car .
 she even tried to get the dmv worker that passed her fired after that .
 she immediately realized she shouldn &apos;t of ever gotten it back .
 she was actually terrified that she had been driving like that .
 years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them .
 i have all the respect in the world for seniors .
 my mother was one of the first women ceo &apos;s in this province and was a hellcat in her day .
 i learned a lot from her .
 but i also learned to accept limitations .
 if you are older reading this post .
 if you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road ,  talk to and listen to your loved ones .
 its horrible to give up that freedom ,  it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up .
 edit thanks for the gold mysterious stranger !
 here in illinois my grandpa had to do it every year after 75
 that &apos;s a great idea .
 i &apos;m going to call my 68 year old congressman and ask him to support such legislation .
 most driving laws are passed by state legislators ,  who usually do drive themselves .
 old retired guy here .
 74 years old to be precise .
 i would accept such a test provided it was only to catch really age related diseases .
  (dementia ,  poor reflexes ,  etc .
 i live in a retirement community and most of the people who should not have a license have already given them up .
 the first day i was here i heard a conversation between two guys .
 guy one:  i just turned 88 and turned in my driver &apos;s license .
 guy two: why would you do that ?
 guy one: i don &apos;t want to spend the rest of my life in jail .
 i &apos;m all for retesting people ,  however ,  i &apos;m not sure what you mean by specialized .
 the requirements for good driving don &apos;t change with age so it should be the same test .
 ideally ,  we &apos;d all be retested every 10 years or so until we hit 60 ,  then we &apos;re retested every 5 years .
 however ,  older folks are a huge voting bloc an it &apos;s unlikely this would ever pass .
 i send patients for driver &apos;s evaluations if their ability to navigate through my office is concerningly questionable .
 unaware drivers are just as dangerous as impaired drivers .
 let me say this about that: .
 the neighbor i love is 93 and still driving ,  when she &apos;s up to it .
 she can barely see the on/off switch on her vacuum cleaner .
 should she be driving ?
 i want her to maintain independence; but at the same time ,  i don &apos;t think it &apos;s safe for her or others .
 yet the dmv doesn &apos;t require her to take a vision exam or a competency test .
 my grandma is practically blind and went to take her driving vision test to renew her license .
 she failed ,  but the lady at the dmv felt bad so she had her take it again and gave her hints so she could pass it .
 so now my practically blind grandma is out on the roads still .
 it &apos;s for their safety as much as anyone else &apos;s .
 i &apos;m so mad that the lady at the dmv was so irresponsible as to let her keep driving .
 when i was 14 my friend was coming to my house and he got killed by my next door neighbor who happened to be elderly .
 my friend was on his skateboard and he was just up the street from my house .
 from the position of his body and where elderly guy stopped his car i could see he made a super sharp left turn that killed him and ran over my other friend .
 the other friend survived and recovered from his injuries .
 but my other friend not so lucky .
 oh and my grand dad has alzheimer &apos;s and frequently forgets where he is ,  and i think he still has his license ,  though my grandma finally took his keys .
 i &apos;m an eye doc and i &apos;d be all for it .
 you know how often i get berated or threatened by geriatrics when i strongly suggest that they quit driving because they no longer meet the legal requirements for driving ?
 people should have to retake the drivers test every 10 years if not 20 .
 i &apos;ve seen too many terrible drivers of all ages .
 can we make everyone take it ?
 seriously ,  i see more horrible drivers in the commuting age bracket than in the retired age bracket .
 my grandma rear ended a line of stopped cars on the highway at full speed ,  no brakes ,  with my 5 year old brother in the car because she thought she saw a deer on the side of the road .
 she &apos;s been in another ,  less serious wreck ,  and has come to a dead stop while on the highway because she forgot where she was going multiple times since then .
 my dad had to unplug her battery and tell her that her car doesn &apos;t work anymore so she would start asking for rides .
 i would love if they took age into account in someway ,  i &apos;m not an expert on anything so i don &apos;t know how they would do it ,  so that families wouldn &apos;t have to be torn between treating their elders like a child or worrying if they &apos;re going to get a call from the hospital any time they &apos;re behind the wheel .
 my fiancee &apos;s brother was killed riding his motorcycle  sunday by a 91 year old who pulled out in front of him .
 he left behind a wife and 3 children .
 he was the one of the best guys i ever met .
 we are all devastated and it could have been prevented .
 that man had no business behind the wheel .
 i &apos;d be ok with it if over-70 drivers are statistically more likely to get into accidents .
 i live in a town that caters to older people ,  and watching them drive is painful .
 by them ,  i mean end of middle age and up .
 from going 30kmph in a 70kmph zone ,  to watching them stare out the side window while going through that same zone .
 they swerve from side to side .
 i refuse to go anywhere with my grandpa driving ,  as he is now a horrible driver and has nearly crashed the car multiple times ,  then blames it on other drivers .
 however ,  i won &apos;t say that only elderly people need to be tested .
 i would hate having to do so ,  but we all should be tested .
 just last night teenagers drove over a schools fence in a large truck .
 people saw them ,  cops haven &apos;t caught them .
 younger people speed more ,  usually 70 in a 50 .
 in just today ,  i got stuck behind someone doing 20kmph in a 50 zone ,  and then while i was going 60kmph someone flew past me like i was standing still .
 the roads would be better if we were all retested ,  and in regards to my town ,  if cops would actually do their job .
 going severely under the speed limit is dangerous just as speeding is .
 we need statistics to show us which demographics cause the most accidents over distance driven .
  if the over-70 leads in this ,  then yes .
 as an insurance professional: just because you have been doing something for a long time ,  does not mean you are good at it .
 drivers should be tested every 5 years ,  not just once you hit a certain age .
 everyone should take a standardized road test every 5 years .
 the inability for old people to drive would result in them voting en mass for public transportation improvements
 by the time the law was passed ,  self driving cars will be available .
 or how about you just have to do a refresher course every ten years ?
 there are a lot of people out there with fully functional senses that still need a reminder about the rules of the road .
 i &apos;d be all for it if we can compensate them by providing transportation to those who can no longer drive for low cost .
 self driving cars may soon fit this position .
 they should make everyone take drivers ed classes every 10 years .
 its ridiculous to think someone who passed drivers ed even 20 years ago knows all the new traffic laws and car technology .
 this has been tried ,  but the organizations like aarp are very powerful and shoot down this type of legislation .
 it &apos;s hard enough to book a driving test these days .
 it takes a good 4 months in the uk .
 this would worsen the situation .
 based on the state of driving i see every day ,  everyone should have to pass a driver &apos;s test every five years .
 it won &apos;t happen .
 i &apos;m assuming you &apos;re talking about the us .
 the dmv is a state level agency not federal ,  so if one state were to have that law another state may not have it .
 70 seems a little young these days .
  i have a neighbor that i fish with at least once a week .
  he drives his truck ,  towing a bass boat ,  without issue and he &apos;s 71 or maybe 72 .
  of course maybe he &apos;s the exception .
 but i can see a test for people of a certain age ,  i &apos;m just not sure what age i &apos;d make the law .
  my chick &apos;s 86 year old grandmother drives but she keeps it to day time hours during clear weather and stays within about a 5 mile radius in our small town .
  grocery store ,  pharmacy ,  post office ,  doctor appointments/vet visits ,  etc .
  she &apos;s not had an accident but i could understand a driving test for her .
  really though ,  her understanding her limitations keeps things safe for her and others .
 it &apos;s such an individual scenario but i guess we &apos;d have to draw a line somewhere .
 my aunt started getting dementia at 58 and should have had her license taken then and there .
 test us every ten years or with referral from a doc .
 perhaps this would be best applied to the overall population .
 re-test with license renewal every 10-20 years by default ,  imo .
 imo driving tests in the us need to be more difficult and have the driver face most every scenario with at least 2 versions of each .
 in addition this should have to be renewed every like 5 or 10 years with your dl .
 im a fire engine driver in oc/la in ca and there are too many drivers (garden grove and dtla) that dont know to pull over and just stop ,  or try and make their turn before we  &apos;catch up &apos; .
 car accidents are the leading fatality for a reason .
 secret to old life like japan ?
 better driving habits and rules
 my father-in-law had some muscular degeneration for a few years before he passed away .
 he couldn &apos;t physically lift his feet to walk ,  and sitting wasn &apos;t much better .
 he ran a stop sign ,  and almost hit another car and a pedestrian with my wife in the car because he couldn &apos;t move his foot from the gas to the brake fast enough .
 she took his license out of his wallet and threw it in the fire when they got home .
 he was pissed for a long time ,  because in his head he was perfectly able to drive ,  and didn &apos;t even recall his near accident .
 who knows how often that actually happened when we weren &apos;t around ?
 i &apos;d rather see mass adoption of autonomous vehicles that would give the elderly the freedom of transportation without the need for driving .
 i believe they would self-police themselves to autonomous vehicles over driving themselves .
 in my experience it seems like everyone needs a refresher after ,  let &apos;s say 10 years .
 one reason is traffic laws change w/o our knowledge except for maybe an article on page 6 of the paper .
 for example ,  i just learned that in pa they passed a law in june 2016 that allows drivers to go through a red light that isn &apos;t changing .
 also it seems that everyone thinks that turn signals and speed limits are optional and the left lane is for going the same speed as every one else .
 why is this so highly upvoted .
 i want everyone to retest every 5 years ,  period ,  and i want the test to actually be both relevant to real driving and failable if you suck .
 this comment should be higher up .
 because of the lengthiness it may not get the attention it deserves but the message is so important and so valid .
 thanks for sharing buddy !
 thank you for sharing .
 it &apos;s a shame it took a few wrecks to make her realize ,  but i respect your mother for voluntarily giving up this freedom and convenience once she realized she was a danger .
  i &apos;d bet most people wouldn &apos;t do that .
 not trying to insult you or anything but after the first accident ,  even the 2nd why would not just take her keys away and say im sorry mom i cant let you hurt yourself or someone else
 i think older drivers definitely need to be retested and have restrictions put on their licence as to driving at night ,  driving only within certain distances of the home ,  driving above certain speeds etc .
 up to and including revocation if found to be impaired to  significant degree .
 and i &apos;m staring down 70 myself .
 in japan ,  they have special decals that identify new drivers and the elderly ,  which i think is a good thing .
 if you see someone with an elderly tag ,  you might not assume that driver sees everything you do or reacts as quickly as you do .
 i had trouble getting my dad to quit driving because i knew he couldn &apos;t see .
 (he couldn &apos;t tell me from my daughter from across the room .
 i called the dmv for suggestions and the sent him a letter to come in for a vision test .
 he was in his 90s with cataracts and dementia .
 we had a lot of rancor over this issue and he ended up living with my brother whom he would actually listen to .
 and he quit driving .
 i &apos;m assuming that &apos;s the same for everyone his age ?
 and if they ever need to get a vote on such an issue .
 its not like seniors are the best at getting themselves to the polls .
 oh ,  you have a young one !
 maryland &apos;s steny hoyer is 78 .
 don &apos;t think i will get a lot of support here .
 fixed autocorrect crap
 also ask him for better public transit .
 let &apos;s get those futurama tubes going
 this is a large part of the problem .
 the people that do the most frequent voting are the elderly and they won &apos;t vote against anything that hinders their independence .
 wow you have a young congressman .
 i live in south florida (boca area) and am an attorney .
 many clients are in retirement communities .
 i always insist on driving to them .
 i &apos;ve only live here a little over a year .
 i &apos;ve witnessed on multiple occasions people driving motorised wheelchairs on 6 lane roads .
 i spent a lot of time at my grandparents  &apos; retirement community  &apos;s pool .
 one particular shocker was overhearing a woman say she was driving around and no longer taking her anti seizure medication .
 several residents sold their cars and bought golf carts and could get around easily that way .
 edit to add:my grandmother ended up bumping into several buildings and another car before deciding to sell her car .
 but she won &apos;t give up her license ,  just in case she decided to take a taxi to a dealership that would gladly sell her a car .
 yeah ,  my grandfather gave up his license she  he was around 70 years old .
 he said he was driving home one day ,  looked around and realized he had no idea where he was .
 he parked his car ,  called my mom to come pick him up and stopped driving then and there .
 the problem is the us is terrible for people without a car .
 rural areas have awful transit options and everything is spread so far apart .
 car oriented design has ruined american cities .
 why did i read that in the two old people muppets voices and wait for a punchline !
 if only most people of any age with poor driving skills were that self-aware .
 that &apos;s a wise old man .
 the problem is ,  dumb people age too .
 maybe he means a few preliminary questions before even getting near a vehicle .
 few people on the road actually drive to the standard required of the test though
 there &apos;s a lot of illness that affects mostly older people (like dementia) .
 i &apos;m assuming the  &apos;specialized &apos; accounts for factors like that ,  that mostly only effect older people .
 the laws themselves can ,  though .
 ideally ,  you &apos;ll have phases of each test to cover the changes in the laws over the last 10 years .
 this is probably the best case scenario .
 i know dangerous drivers at any age .
 but have tests more often at younger and older ages for obvious reasons .
 in finland it &apos;s this way .
 however it is an medical examination only ,  not a driving test .
 (though its 5 years after 70 or if you have motorbike license)
 ideally ,  i &apos;d never have to go to the dmv again .
 i don &apos;t know how effective a retest would be for drivers who aren &apos;t impaired by health conditions - it &apos;s very easy to just abide by the speed limit laws and regulations when testing and go back to speeding immediately afterwards .
 yes ,  this is the answer .
 why should we pass a test at 16 and never have to prove competency again ?
 think of all the bad behaviors you see on the road and how much they might be reduced if we did this .
 would make the roads safer for everyone .
 a computer test that focuses on new laws and most ignored laws with a driving portion looking for basic ability and proper behaviors .
 i don &apos;t understand why we don &apos;t have simulators (like computer games) that folks can take to improve their skills and maybe get reductions on insurance .
 simulators give folks the opportunity to try something with no risk and could give feedback to teach some better skills .
 i &apos;m amazed at how many people pull way up and stop when they have to merge into a lane of traffic .
 they should stop back further so they can accelerate to be moving when the opening in traffic reaches them .
 would reduce traffic delays saving time and energy .
 there are many skills that are never taught through the manual or the test .
 in these comments /u/steev182 said  &apos; .
 too many people see the car driving test as the end of their driving education .
  &apos; we should have a focus on continuing to learn and improve this critical skill ,  not once and done .
 i work with the olds for a living .
 the frequency that they casually drop  &apos;my doctor told me i can &apos;t drive anymore &apos; coupled with the fact that they drove to my office is terrifying .
 one woman could barely walk ,  who also told me she couldn &apos;t see while i was demonstrating something to her .
 got in her car and drove away after her appointment .
 there &apos;s another man who constantly tells us he  &apos;donated &apos; his car to someone who needed it but regrets it because he has to take the bus everywhere .
 the son told us they literally had to take it away because he kept driving on sidewalks and running lights ,  and he refused to stop driving after his license was suspended for drunk driving .
 i watched another woman just yolo pull away from the curb as she was leaving ,  nearly causing a multi-car pile up .
 one woman came in because she had head trauma from an accident she caused .
 she drove herself .
 also i &apos;ve also had my bumper smashed in by a patient just trying to park in the spot next to me .
 i get a full dose of their cognitive skills in my office .
 there are many times i &apos;m pleasantly surprised at how sharp they still are .
 but more often than not i &apos;m afraid for those who are sharing the road with them on their way home .
 while i agree they do deserve the dignity of having the same rights as everyone else ,  i do not believe that right should supersede the safety of literally anyone else on the road with them .
 there should be so much more to the test than just being able to see and being able to putter down the street at 30 mph and parallel park .
 there should be attentiveness and processing speed elements to the test .
 if you can &apos;t keep up with the stimulus ,  you shouldn &apos;t be on the road impeding and endangering everyone else .
 self driving cars can’t come soon enough .
 what a blessing for people who want their independence but shouldn’t be anywhere near a steering wheel !
 i know of someone (north of 80 years old) who had horrible cataracts ,  had refused to visit an optometrist for years ,  and was not fit to drive .
 they avoided eye examinations because they knew they would have their license taken .
 when they finally went to get a cataract surgery scheduled ,  their doctor told them that if they agreed not to drive until after the surgery and after their eyes healed ,  they would not have their license taken .
 legally ,  they can drive .
 but hoooooly fuck they should not be anywhere near a road .
 i &apos;m all for retesting ,  because it would catch shit like that .
 witnessed a 90+ year old lady killed a 70+ year old lady in a parking lot ,  and injured her husband .
 people were screaming stop to the driver when she slowly backed the car ,  knocked down the couple and ran them over ,  but she couldn &apos;t hear anything .
 i was traumatized .
 that &apos;s the kind of thing that should get you fired from the dmv ,  if not charged with a criminal offence .
 as a 69 year old grandma i completely agree that we should take a test to make sure we are still safe drivers .
 there is a special drivers program for people over 55 that teaches defensive driving for older drivers to compensate for slower reflexes .
 no one should put others at risk on the road .
 that includes driving under the influence for people under 70 too .
 somewhere buried in my post history is me asking r/legaladvice what to do about that same problem .
 i see dmv clerks cheating old people through the vision test regularly when i &apos;m stuck there .
 it makes me so fucking mad .
 i &apos;m sure it sucks telling someone they can &apos;t renew their license ,  but it sucks more if that person murders themselves and/or others because you let someone control a fucking speeding death machine who can &apos;t see .
 seems to me the test isn &apos;t the problem but the workers at dmv are .
 why spend money on a special test when the normal one is fine if enforced ?
 i was at the grocery store the other day .
 i politely apologized to an elderly lady for standing in her way .
  &apos;it &apos;s ok ,  i can &apos;t really see anything anyway .
 didn &apos;t see you there .
  &apos; i saw her getting out of the driver &apos;s side of her car on my way into the store .
 my grandma has been suffering from memory loss and i believe has been recently diagnosed with alzheimers ?
 (i &apos;m out of the loop) but my family took her keys away with the advice of the doctor ,  but she was super pissed and kept forgetting the conversation so they had to keep telling her over and over and they finally buckled and let her take a driving test .
 i was horrified .
 she gets lost and lives on these windy ass back roads .
 i fear for her every day that she might get confused and drive off the road .
 her doctor was just like  &apos;ok she passed she can drive .
  &apos; like uhhhh i don &apos;t think she needs to be driving ,  her daughter lives literally 5 minutes away and can take her wherever she needs to go !
 meanwhile the dmv won &apos;t even give me a state id because all i have for identification is a state id .
   how can that possibly not meet their documentation requirements ?
 lmao the one time someone working at the dmv has sympathy; it &apos;s for all the wrong reasons .
 that &apos;s horrible ,  i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
 this needs to be higher up
 honestly ,  thank you for at least suggesting it .
 elderly drivers are so rampant in fl that i &apos;m literally scared to drive because one of them may kill me some day .
 one already disabled my mother for a number of years .
 you should have sued and taken her pension checks .
 this reminds me of drivers in my area who drive straight through roundabouts without even a glance to the right to check for oncoming traffic .
 sometimes they see you when they &apos;ve already entered the roundabout ,  but by this stage you &apos;ve already had to slow down or slam on your brakes to avoid an accident .
 someone on a shower thought replied to this .
 it was something along the lines of  &apos;those shitty drivers will pass the test with flying colors .
 because those shitty drivers are all of us .
  &apos; and i think he &apos;s right on the money .
 i consider myself to be a pretty alright driver; i don &apos;t speed much ,  i indicate ,  and i look before i make a move .
 but on an off day where i &apos;m in an unfamiliar area ,  i &apos;ll be hesitant and i &apos;ll get the horn from the dude behind me .
 and that dude probably thinks i &apos;m a shitty driver .
 and that dude probably has made mistakes like this .
 we &apos;re human ,  we make mistakes .
 that is because there are more of them to see being active driving at specific times and continuing to be alive at a greater rate .
 i ride a motorcycle and almost got hit by an elderly woman going the wrong way down a one way street a few months ago .
 i was honking and waving my hands and she was blissfully unaware of my existence .
 i managed to swerve off to the side with enough room to spare but what if i had a bigger bike and wouldn &apos;t have been able to ?
 we ended up going to the same place and when i asked her if she knew she was going the wrong way and if she even saw me she said ,   &apos;oh no dear i was going the right way ,  you were just speeding .
  &apos; i was literally going less than 10 mph because i was getting ready to turn ,  and even if i was did she plan on just mowing me down ?
 it &apos;s ridiculous that she was so oblivious to what actually happened and still got behind the wheel of a car and drove home .
 i &apos;m so sorry for your loss ,  that &apos;s really terrible .
 i &apos;m gonna drop my pegs for him tomorrow .
 i &apos;m sure this will get buried at this point ,  but i work in risk analysis for a major auto insurance company and i can tell you with 100% certainty that once drivers hit the age of 74 ,  their chances of vehicular accidents increases drastically .
 you make a good point .
 without data it could just be bias and unfounded .
 i think the stigma doesn &apos;t really come from accidents ,  it comes from clear mistakes that you see that age group make while driving .
 usually it &apos;s completely anecdotal .
 i &apos;ve seen a few scratches and bumps made by old ladies who can &apos;t park etc .
 but i doubt it gets reported .
 still not completely sure that they would be a danger to other drivers ,  but that &apos;s just my opinion .
 i studied this in emergency management (my under grad) .
 ages 65+ are more dangerous than teen drivers in pa ,  at least .
 and given the amount of older civilians that have almost run me off the road or t-boned me ,  compared to teen drivers or anyone else ,  i &apos;d say i &apos;ve experienced the same result .
 when i lived in florida ,  people over 65 caused more accidents per mile driven than any age group except teenagers .
 you &apos;re in control of a huge metal vehicle .
 people need to be damn good at controlling said vehicle otherwise they shouldn &apos;t be driving it .
 i &apos;m all for everyone having equal opportunities at it ,  but we need to be tested to make sure we &apos;re capable .
 agreed ,  but testing people won &apos;t stop them from speeding .
  you can prove you know how to read a speed limit sign during a driving test but this most likely won &apos;t stop people from doing it on their own .
 i think impatience has a lot to do with accidents ,  if only people could see the bigger picture ,  that sure ,  they &apos;re running late or they hate just sitting in traffic ,  but that &apos;s not a great reason to cut through parking lot spaces at a high speed ,  especially when you can &apos;t see if anyone is coming from the left or right until it &apos;s too late .
 i &apos;ve always though states should issue id cards ,  but the driving privileges should be issued by insurance company .
  if no-one is willing to take financial responsibility for you ,  then no license .
 i &apos;d be ok with this if all dmvs were like utah ,  with the dl division being separated .
   as it were ,  spending thirty fucking hours getting my license and plates in las vegas (no test required) ,  i can &apos;t condone any requirement (including this one or voter id) that forces people to go to the dmv .
 maybe every 10 would be more appropriate .
 i honestly couldn &apos;t face the prospect of losing my license every 5 years .
 the inability of old people to drive would result in them voting in en mass to restore their ability to drive ,  changing nothing .
 finally a rational take on the issue ,  this comment needs much more attention .
 if we take away their licenses before we implement a way for them to get to the doctor ,  grocery store ,  church ,  and any other place they need to go we end up fixing one issue and creating many others .
  public transit can be a solution in many areas ,  but huge portions of retired folks move to semi rural communities in the southeast and southwest .
  economically speaking there would be huge hurdles to overcome .
 or public transportation .
 it is only written if i remember correctly .
 old people vote .
 but the uk does require a license renewal after 70 every 3 years ?
 and that requires a doctor &apos;s approval ?
 so at least you have that .
 most eu countries require a doctor &apos;s approval after a certain age .
 everyone is balls deep in their phones 
 it is now the top comment on the top thread of all time
 i &apos;m an optometrist .
 you &apos;d be surprised at how many patients come in and tell me they failed the dmv vision test ,  but the person passed them anyway .
 drivers not being able to drive a certain distance beyond home ?
 i &apos;m afraid that i &apos;m going to need to vehemently disagree with that .
 in australia learners have an  &apos;l &apos; plate ,  and have to do 100 hours (more in some states) .
 once they pass that stage they have one year of displaying a red  &apos;p &apos; (provisional ,  i think) plate ,  then two of a green p ,   before they earn an open lisence .
 the restrictions on these three plates vary state by state ,  but in mine all plates can drive the full speed limit ,  p players have a power/weight restriction ,  and red p platers cannot have more than one non-family member in the car between the hours of 11pm and 6am iirc
 hailing from japan ,  i also think that the decals would work wonderfully in other countries too .
 but we still have problems with the elderly mistaking the accelerator from the break pedal .
 every year ,  there are numerous fatal accidents involving the aforementioned mistake the elder lies make .
 one time a mother and child were killed at a convenience store parking space because of that .
 it sucks to retake driving tests ,  but it would surely help identify those who aren &apos;t fit enough .
 nope ,  its the grandpa beryebasa law .
  weird but it keeps us safer .
 no i &apos;m sure it was just the one person
 naw it was just an elaborate prank .
 you just made it all make sense .
 younger voters are afraid to drive to the polls ,  lest they be hit by old farts in big cars careening down the road to cast their ballot .
 maybe some are even being killed before reaching the polls ,  too ,  reducing the number of younger voters further .
 i &apos;ve literally seen buses from the senior homes shipping them in to vote if the voting center wasn &apos;t already in their cafeteria (which it was the last two times) .
 how would you feel about a law that requires people over 70 to pass a specialized legislating test in order to continue legislating ?
 sadly not ,  even though i get to play  &apos;drunk or 80 year old &apos; every morning on 695 .
 no they &apos;re cool with setting the end dates for ss/healthcare here in 20 or 25 years .
 you know ,  after they &apos;re already gone because hey .
 i got mine fuck everyone else .
 that’s because they don’t need it and don’t care .
 they still want to drive ,  even if realistically they barely ever drive themselves .
 are you saul goodman ?
 when i had a seizure i was told my license was suspended .
 which it turned out it wasn &apos;t ,  since i went and got my normal license (was on a permit) soon after no problems .
 my dad had apparently stopped taking his siezure medications because  &apos;they &apos;re expensive and he would rather pay for food for me &apos; .
 i found this put after he got into a very very minor  &apos;accident &apos; and for his license taken away ,  thankfully !
 he had a seizure behind the wheel and luckily just slowly rolled to the side of the road ,  and stayed there until someone found him .
 he also luckily didn &apos;t come to until after because otherwise he would have absolutley just driven home .
 i was livid when i found out but obviously very grateful that nothing worse happened .
 it sucked that he was now inconvienced but i mean fuck ,  it could &apos;ve been so so much worse .
 i was about 15 at the time ,  and living with him part time .
 my grandparents live in a 60+ year old only community .
 a few months ago ,  a neighbor had a seizure and crashed through their bedroom wall at 8am .
 thankfully they are early risers .
 this was apparently the second time he had a seizure behind the wheel within the last year .
 two weeks later ,  he had another and crashed into a street lamp and died .
 luckily he didn &apos;t kill my grandparents ,  or any one else .
 how there are no regulations in place to take that mans license away is beyond me .
 he &apos;d still be alive if there was .
  but we &apos;re already in a retirement home !
 if they &apos;re in a retirement community that implies a level of acceptance about their aging that probably helps .
  &apos;sir ,  do you know what year it is ?
 if it &apos;s a question an older driver needs to be able to answer we might as well ask everyone ,  even if it &apos;s much less likely to be relevant for younger drivers .
  &apos;so ,  how about those millennials ?
 he means an oral test .
 we would all do well to take a refresher course every 5-10 years .
 at least have to read a book and do a written and practical portion .
 yeah ,  it &apos;s not a renewal so much as a forced details update .
 $28 for a renewal .
 god damn ,  i want to live in whatever state you get your license from .
 i renewed my license online in pennsylvania .
  same cost of 30$ though .
 of course they should have the same rights as everyone else .
 driving ,  however ,  is not a right .
 driving is a privilege at any age .
 driving is a privilege ,  not a right .
 perhaps even more importantly ,  it would save us from drunks and idiots who insist on texting while they drive .
 what &apos;s equally important is that elderly people who depend upon driving in order to attend appointments ,  social events ,  and grocery shop--but are no longer fit to drive--should be given suitable recourse .
 many elderly folks live independently from their families for reasons dictated by (newer) social norms and post-industrial economy .
 multi-generational households are less of the norm than in past decades because younger people must relocate to where the jobs are .
 furthermore ,  north american is expansive in geography .
 many people don &apos;t live in very densely populated cities where they can walk ,  use a taxi/uber ,  or use public transportation; they are almost obliged to drive .
 i &apos;m all for legally taking away the keys of incompetent drivers--we did it to my grandmother who grieved over it deeply .
 but ,  we must also implement adequate social programs so that revoking a license isn &apos;t a social death as well .
 /u/motonutter ,  thank you for the gold !
 i had a neighbor that was also north of 80 ,  who confessed to me a few months before he died that he was having mini-strokes while driving .
 i was working at a home-cooking take-out place at the time ,  and he would come in every day for the mac & cheese .
 i begged him to let me bring it to him but he was equally adamant that i not .
 just wanted to add ,  this was small town new england .
 the only places he ever drove to were dunkin donuts ,  and my place of work ,  and slow as molasses running uphil in january .
 my uncle was deaf ,  by the time he was 70 his vision was terrible ,  because of his deafness he never learned to talk so we mostly just got grunts and odd sounds out of him .
  he lived in a small town and even though everyone knew he wasn &apos;t fit to drive they still let him because (at that time) there was no grocery delivery or anything like that and they knew if he didn &apos;t ,  and no one stepped up he would die in that house of starvation .
  thankfully he only drove once a week ,  on one exact route ,  and everyone knew it .
  he passed away many years ago ,  but it always scared me that he was able to drive .
 my great grandmother would take a xanax before driving because it would stress her out so much .
 finally got in a minor accident from it making her drowsy and my family took her license away .
  on the other hand ,  we need to make sure they have someone to help them get where they need to go .
  thankfully my great grandmother had a lot of family members ready and willing to take her wherever she wanted to go .
 the problem is too many see elderly people losing the ability to drive as them  &apos;losing their independence &apos; .
 it &apos;s hard for people ,  like doctors or dmv employees ,  to tell someone who &apos;s probably been driving for decades that they &apos;re no longer allowed to do that ,  so i can see their motivation behind wanting to  &apos;help them out a little &apos; .
 but it &apos;s incredibly short sighted .
 around the time my grandfather had to stop driving (because my mom and grandma basically told him he couldn &apos;t do it anymore) ,  he was pretty well into alzheimer &apos;s .
 think of all of the terrible things you &apos;ve heard alzheimer &apos;s does to someone &apos;s mind - now imagine that person is in charge of driving around a 4 , 000 lbs box of motorized death .
 if he &apos;d had to make a split second decision on the road ,  it would have ended badly .
 another personal experience for me with an elderly driver is the woman who backed her car into my car at a walmart parking lot as i was honking my horn at her .
 i had to get out and smack on her window to get her attention - she hadn &apos;t seen me ,  didn &apos;t hear my horn ,  and didn &apos;t feel that she had hit another car .
 how is a woman who is completely oblivious of her surroundings fit to be behind the wheel of a car ?
 simple: she &apos;s not .
 losing the ability to drive is sad ,  but is it as sad as someone getting killed ?
 is it worth endangering lives just so an elderly person isn &apos;t angry because they can &apos;t drive ?
 where i am they do retest ,  i think over 80 ,  but it &apos;s computerized and they let them try a few times because they are unaccustomed to video games .
 basically the folks running it don &apos;t want to have to take their licences .
 doctors also have the right to revoke dl but again rarely do .
 my grandmother had 6 accidents in a year ,  2 with parked cars and the only deterrent was increased insurance rates .
 her kids finally got her to stop driving by proving that it would be less expensive to travel the same distance by cab than by car at her current rates .
 she was over 90 at the time .
 in high school my driver &apos;s ed .
 teacher told us that his wife failed the eye test went she renewed her license in person so she got a with glasses only warning on her license .
 he told us his vision was worse than hers so he only renewed his by mail .
 guy was senile and old as hell ,  he would learn who 3 people were in class and as long as they showed up he didn &apos;t care .
  one day a lot more of us skipped than usual and only 7 people were in class ,  but people still answered for other during role-call ,  so he marked all 30 people present .
 eye doctors actually cannot legally report patients who fail to meet the visual requirement for driving; breach of confidentiality .
 i &apos;ve had a patient yell in my face when they brought in a verification form from the dmv (if an optom fills out a form staying the patient meets the requirements in office they can get around the vision screener there) because i would not commit fraud for them .
 over here ,  we have to get medical cards every 2 years that a doctor has physically passed us to drive for commercial vehicles .
 maybe something like that would help ,  because if something like that does happen ,  the doctor is on the hook for it as well for passing them .
 yeah ,  i saw an old lady driving the wrong way ,  exiting out an entrance only lane that was clearly marked  &apos;do not enter &apos; and  &apos;wrong way &apos; heading directly into four lanes of oncoming traffic .
 i knocked on her window and yelled at her to stop ,  and she rolled down her window completely bewildered .
  i pointed out the signs and the fact she was facing heavy oncoming traffic head on and that she had to turn around and go out the exit on the other side .
 she just said  &apos;but i &apos;m going over there ,  &apos; pointing at the store on the other side of the highway .
  and with that she drove head on on the wrong side of the road through four lanes of traffic that had to dodge and weave around her ,  through a major intersection against the red light (which of course she couldn &apos;t see because she was on the wrong side of the damn road) ,  and somehow made it to the store on the other side without getting hit .
 all these 60+ year old people on reddit is mind boggling to me .
 wow ,  that &apos;s really cool .
  i think both programs should be connected .
 that program seems like a great idea .
 or driving while on meth and while we are at it .
 driving while you are between the age of 16 and 19 because that is the age group that has three times the accident rate of any other group including the elderly fyi .
 you know what &apos;s worse that telling poor doris she can &apos;t drive ?
 doris killing someone after she gets a pity pass .
 cowards who can &apos;t deliver bad news shouldn &apos;t be in that job .
 you &apos;d think the government would be more invested in that shit .
 last time i went to the dmv (in ca) an employee very loudly and repeatedly shamed an old man who was trying to get his license renewed .
 which had been revoked .
 i felt bad for the guy at first but he kept arguing .
 the employee became irate and told him he needed a doctor &apos;s clearance ,  driving and vision test in order to reinstate .
 so i guess it depends greatly on the employee .
 i think people apply emotion to this subject with the wrong emphasis .
 it should be more important keeping someone  &apos;at risk &apos; off the roads; to prevent potential accidents which may lead to death ,  than making sure grams or gramps still have their pride in tact .
 in this day and age there are grocery delivery services ,  medical transport ,  uber ,  lyft etcetera .
 which leaves no real need for those who shouldn &apos;t be driving ,  to be on the road .
 send video to a tv news tip line .
 perhaps the rules should be amended to state that the person who signs off on a person over a certain age will be held responsible for any accident they cause .
 bet that would put a stop to pushing elderly thru the system .
 our neighbor was suffering from dementia and her son unplugged the car battery or something and just told her the car was broken .
 she would do things like try to use the oven to heat the house .
 if she was diagnosed with alzheimer &apos;s then she shouldn &apos;t be living alone anyways .
 she can also get lost just walking around .
 there comes a point in every aging persons life that they will need 24/7 care or supervision .
 it &apos;s just the circle of life .
 finally another  &apos;timmy fucking died &apos; sprog .
 still warm too 
 and so does the dmv worker .
 blame can be shared .
 dmv worker i think shares far more especially since she failed her job and put a dangerous person on the road .
 every day that i drive in this cesspool of dying people and insane millennials ,  i lose another piece of my soul .
 they &apos;re either trucks driving 150mph with one hand on the wheel while asleep eating a pub sub ,  or some old fart going 35mph in the left lane of i-75 with both blinkers on
 we had a pretty solid test in va .
 had to take 6 weeks of driver’s classroom training and then had to do several test drives with an instructor before we could get our actual license .
 the final approval is done by the training instructor ,  but you take the knowledge test at the dmv .
 the one i took in florida consisted of making a 3 point turn ,  making a turn at a stop sign ,  parking correctly between the lines and not hitting the concrete stop ,  reversing in a straight line for some distance ,  and the tester asking how to park correctly on a hill .
  it was way easier than i was expecting considering the driving instructor i was previously learning from had me going on i-95 the second day i was behind the wheel .
 and meanwhile i recall barely passing my driving test .
 i recall the instructor docking points because i used my turn signal when turning right was literally the only thing you could do .
 i got penalized for an action that would have affected literally nothing .
 in the netherlands you take an almost hour long driving test that consists of city driving ,  highway/interstate driving ,  3 point turn ,  parallel parking ,  how you utilize your mirrors and blinkers ,  anticipation of other traffic ,  yielding properly and i &apos;m sure i &apos;ve missed a bunch of other things since it &apos;s been over 10 years since i did it .
 as a european ,  this is exactly how it goes - anything slightly dangerous and you &apos;re fucked .
 for instance ,  don &apos;t stop at a crossing when there &apos;s a person waiting and you gotta retake the test ,  and of course pay for it .
 man that &apos;s crazy .
 it &apos;s not even always old people .
 there are so many people that forget they are behind the wheel of a 2 , 000 lbs vehicle .
 my pegs too ,  mate .
 everything about that incident makes my blood boil .
 even if you had been speeding ,  i don &apos;t see how that affects the fact that she was going the wrong way down a one-way street !
 i don &apos;t know how it is where you live ,  but where i live there is a prevailing sentiment of motorcyclists always being in the wrong ,  regardless of circumstances .
 motorcyclist hit and killed by someone who changed lanes over the top of them ?
  &apos;oh he was probably speeding or something .
 as a motorcycle rider ,  i &apos;ve never heard of  &apos;dropping pegs &apos; for someone .
 care to explain ?
 i am genuinely curious .
 also ,  according to that report ,  people over 70 are a lot more likely to get in a fatal car crash .
 i would believe those statistics .
 it actually never made sense to me to treat those under 18 as minors in regards to most laws and not allow them to enter contracts etc but then trust them with a 2 ton vehicle .
 same goes for drinking age ,  if you can &apos;t trust someone to drink responsibly i don &apos;t think you can trust them for responsible driving either .
 i know that in us driving is required in rural areas etc etc but then the drinking and contract age limits are the ones that are wrong .
 70 seems such an arbitrary point .
 from what i &apos;ve seen ,  people start becoming a danger to others around 76-84 .
 reaction time ,  judgement ,  vision ,  all of it becomes impaired .
 one note i will add is the hidden cost .
 i currently do 80% of the driving errands for my grandfolks - multiple doctor appointments and trips to the store each month (i spend 6 hours a month just getting their groceries) .
 take away their license and someone has to assume those responsibilities .
 yeah just because it didn &apos;t cause an accident doesn &apos;t mean it didn &apos;t negatively impact drivers commutes .
 driving slow ,  swerving across lanes ,  running lights ,  and causing people to slam on their brakes when someone randomly stops in the middle of the road wouldn &apos;t get reported .
 yet from personal experience when i pass  &apos;those &apos; types of cars it &apos;s an extremely elderly person in them .
 it &apos;s less likely to get in an accident because someone is doing 25 on the interstate ,  but that doesn &apos;t mean they didn &apos;t cause a traffic backup of thousands of people for a few hours .
 affecting all those lives instead of just 1 or 2 .
 most accidents happen from either not having proper speed for the situation or distraction while driving .
 i believe most incidents with older drivers tend to be reaction time and confusion a lot of older people are aware of this so they &apos;ll drive slower so they can respond and don &apos;t see how traveling a significantly slower speed than traffic around you can be just as hazardous .
 i used to work in a shop and most of the elderly peoples accidents were from rolling forward (can &apos;t feel pressure on their feet) or problems caused by them not being able to turn to check blind spots .
 we also got a few people who would start rolling forward ,  panic ,  and hit he gas when attempting to stop but then again we also had a 16 year old drive into the building doing the same thing .
 they don &apos;t always get in accidents ,  but cause them .
 they force other drivers to make up for their mistakes and put themselves at risk .
 where i live ,  we have graduated licensing for ages 16-19 (zero tolerance for alcohol vs  .
 08 for older drivers ,  no driving on expressways ,  limit to number of passengers in car) .
 does that take into account miles driven ?
 if 16-19 year olds are driving a lot more than 70+ ,  then even if they are safer drivers ,  they could still have more accidents .
 i &apos;d argue there are probably more people in the 16-19 bracket than 85+ .
 the dmvs over here in michigan are pretty sparse .
 the ability to sign up for appointments online massively reduced the crowding .
 what if it started at 10 years ,  and a year was removed for every moving violation or ticket ?
 speedsters and poor stewards of the road would be tested frequently; boring drivers last a bit longer between tests .
 i think you just summed up us politics in one sentence .
 i get what you are saying ,  but i disagree with it .
 if you shouldn &apos;t be driving ,  you shouldn &apos;t be driving regardless of lack or alternatives or how inconvenient it would be .
 this isn &apos;t an age issue ,  it is a safety issue .
 if a 30 year old blind person can &apos;t drive ,  why can a 70 year old with cataracts so bad they legally blind be allowed to keep driving ?
 because we feel bad that they used to be able to drive and go to the grocery store and church by themselves ?
 i get that it sucks ,  but if you want to live independently without being able to drive in a rural community ,  you are going to have a bad time !
 either family needs to step up to help you out ,  or you need to move somewhere that supports an independent lifestyle without a requirement of needing to drive .
 i &apos;m a t1 diabetic so there are plenty of things in this world that i &apos;m not allowed to do because it would be too dangerous; should i be allowed to do them because i really ,  really want to ?
 hell ,  i &apos;m required to get my doctor to sign off on my ability to drive every few years (up to 4 years max) .
 i &apos;m 33 ,  never been in an accident ,  never been to the hospital due to my diabetes ,  never lost consciousness ,  never had a seizure ,  and my a1c is amazing ,  but i &apos;m somehow more of a danger than a 90 year old ?
 if for some reason my doctor believes me continuing to be able to drive would be a danger to myself or others ,  should i just be allowed to drive so i can live in a semi-rural area and still go to the doctor ,  grocery store ,  and work ?
 last time they sent me to form for my doctor to sign ,  i somehow missed or didn &apos;t get it in the mail and didn &apos;t know it was due until i got notification that my license was cancelled .
 well ,  my endocrinologist just happened to be out of town that week and none of the other physicians would sign off on it without seeing me first and no appointments until my endo would be back anyways so i called the department of public safety to explain and ask for an extra week .
 they basically told me i was fucked and my licensed would be cancelled until the form was submitted as i may be a danger and ineligible to drive .
 i get that t1 diabetics aren &apos;t a huge influential voting block ,  but we are already making portions of the population jump through hoops to keep their driving privileges .
 i &apos;m not mad that i have to do it and even though i have been inconvenienced because of it ,  i honestly think it is a great idea .
 driving is already dangerous enough without needing to worry about people with medical issues ruining your life or someone else &apos;s because they want to be independent and live literally the worst place to live independently without being able to drive .
 yes you don &apos;t need to get in a car ,  the test mainly tests for cognitive function .
  my grandfather did it recently and said it was almost entirely questions about the hands on a clock and then some reaction time things and an eye test .
 brexit can attest to this
 those dmv people that pass people who fail eye tests are criminals !
 why are they doing that ?
 i once got a taxi licence this way .
 i had clearly failed but the agent kept giving me the right answers .
 at the end she exclaimed that i had barely passed .
 i still don &apos;t have the designation on my license ,  though i have never driven without my glasses .
 i simply can &apos;t .
 i &apos;ve personally seen dmv employees tell people who failed the test  &apos;oh that &apos;s okay sweetie ,  you passed &apos; and renew their license anyways .
 was blown away the first few times ,  now i just assume anyone driving with grey hair might be blind .
 this happened with my grandma as well .
  no central vision in one eye ,  and cataracts ,  and dementia .
 she was due for a renewal and failed at one place ,  but then went to one down the road and they passed her .
 my family was banking on that failed license to finally get the keys away from her .
  it &apos;s infuriating (not to mention extremely dangerous) .
 my parents would often drop me off at my grandma &apos;s house as a child to hang out and do grandma/granddaughter stuff .
 but ,  the strict rule was ,   &apos;no getting in a car with grandma after 5:00pm &apos; .
 if she tried ,  i was to call them immediately .
 grandma loves her scotch and benzos haha .
 if county won &apos;t do anything ,  call the state police and report not only her poor driving ,  but also the local cops for not performing their duty .
 it &apos;s truly a miracle she hasn &apos;t killed anyone yet .
 i would just keep  &apos;disabling &apos; the car without her knowledge .
 she would have no idea why the car never wants to turn on .
 this was a wild ride and i thoroughly enjoyed it .
 in all seriousness i &apos;m sorry you have to be the one to bear the brunt of responsibility and anxiety ,  especially since you &apos;ve clearly done everything you can and it &apos;s out of your control .
 i feel the same way bout my great grandma (i &apos;m 29 .
 she &apos;s 89) whom is a public menace behind the wheel .
 i love her dearly ,  but she &apos;s been in four accidents the last year alone .
 it &apos;s a similar situation ,  though .
 nobody is willing to take on the responsibility of taking away what is essentially her freedom :\ .
 it sucks all around .
 there was an elderly lady in my hometown who killed a 14 year old kid and seriously injured the friend he was walking with (on the sidewalk) last year .
 similar story in that there had been complaints/previous accidents that were not taken very seriously .
 you know ,  until she literally ran two kids over (and didn &apos;t stop ,  either .
 she apparently did not realize that she had hit them ,  and only stopped when she ran into a creek ditch in the park down the street from the boys) .
 i believe she may have had dementia ,  as well .
 the dmv pretty much refuses to do anything with elderly drivers .
 but elderly people need transport options if they can &apos;t drive .
 that &apos;s the biggest thing ,  i think .
 my mom tried to get my grandpa &apos;s license taken away (i mean ,  he really shouldn &apos;t have been driving) ,  but despite literally living next door to him ,  she was appallingly unhelpful when it came to driving him around .
 i mean ,  he wasn &apos;t going to magically start taking the bus after 60 years of driving ,  you know ?
 set up a lyft account for your elderly ,  or a taxi account ,  or drive them ,  something ,  anything .
 yes ,  take their licenses when necessary ,  that needs to be improved ,  for sure .
 but don &apos;t leave your elders stranded ,  either ,  you know ?
 (not directed at you ,  specifically ,  yellowricemacaroons ,  just sort of society in general)
 my grandmother thinks she still has her license .
 it has lapsed and her dementia is getting worse .
 she hasn &apos;t driven in over a year ,  since she and my grandfather went in to a retirement home .
 as my dad was reading out the requirements for the test on the letter they sent she was like  &apos;okay ,  okay ,  okay &apos; and then eye test and she &apos;s like  &apos;ohh &apos; .
 my grandfather has had alzheimer &apos;s for years and he remembers that he doesn &apos;t have his license ,  but not why he can &apos;t can &apos;t drive .
 for many older drivers ,  it &apos;s a freedom thing .
 have you tried to talk to her doctor ?
 had a friend who told his mom for her safety and for the safety of those around her ,  it &apos;s in her best interest to stop driving and she refused .
 he called her doctor ,  told the doctor of his fear regarding her still driving at such an advanced age and asked the doctor if he could help .
 my friend drove her to a doctor &apos;s appointment and as they were on their way home ,  she mentioned that may be a good idea if she stopped driving and handed over her keys .
 went through this with my mom .
 i found that occasionally hiding her keys helped .
 i had a selection of things to choose from ,  and just kept alternating .
 disconnected the battery cable .
 exchanged her car key on her key ring with my extra car key .
 let the air out of her tire(s) .
 unplugged the garage door opener .
 you get creative as time rolls on .
 and when she seriously injures herself or another ,  i hope somebody successfully sues the fuck out of those that ignored the warnings .
 generally that &apos;s the only way things change
 if you are really concerned about her than make her an appointment for an eye exam tell her if she can drive you to  &apos;your &apos;  eye exam then she can finally get her eyes checked .
 if she is still stubborn about price be kind enough to buy them for her so she will have no excuses ,  that might fix a few driving problems .
 i &apos;m only gonna say that my grandma is 69 and she goes the minimum speed on the highway .
 as in 45 when the maximum speed limit is 70 .
 she doesn &apos;t need to be on the highway .
 but that &apos;s why i say she shouldn &apos;t .
 i &apos;d say restrictions should be on a case by case basis .
 not everyone is going to be the same .
 finally ,  some politicians doing their jobs right !
 i usually am not a fan of unlimited anonymous campaign donations but the #fuckgrandpaberyebasalaw2017 was worth every cent gave by the millions of us who supported it
 i mean it could only be for old people with medical disabilities or who &apos;ve gotten in a wreck .
 you want more sense ?
 many old people at that age are retired and have all the time in the world to follow politics and get to the polling booth .
 whereas younger people are too busy with work ,  school ,  and relationships to think about that stuff let alone participate .
 i mean ,  thats called reelection mate .
 america would be a lot better off .
 greetings fellow baltimore beltway driver !
 i personally prefer to play  &apos;accident or construction &apos; when there &apos;s a holdup .
 i always tell people that retirement will be outlawed by the time i &apos;m old enough to retire 
  &apos;fuck you ,  got mine .
 off topic but since you brought up ss ,  if the salary cap was removed and everyone paid their percentage into the fund on their full earnings it would be solvent forever .
 this is the change to social security all young people should be demanding 
 old people love him .
 better call someguy469 !
 in australia i has a seizure during surgery and had my license suspended .
 i had to wait 3 months and have several tests before they decided there was nothing wrong with me .
 it then took them another month before the paper work was done for me to drive again .
 this is why i am planning to retire to a more urban area .
 i don &apos;t want to be trapped in my own home ,  reliant on others to take me to appointments/for groceries/etc .
  i am coming up at the end of my tenure of not having a license .
  there are so many jobs i cant get because  &apos;license required &apos; or is too far away .
  even a job 5 minutes from my house i could walk to asked if i could drive an 18foot bed truck .
  the struggle is real in rural america .
 my dad got in a minor accident a few months ago with some very old woman .
 at first she didn &apos;t even know what state she was in (she kept talking about the ohio police) ,  then when she found out she was in waynedale she kept asking about the waynedale police (well ,  waynedale hasn &apos;t had an independent police force in decades ,  its part of fort wayne now) .
 and she kept forgetting both issues and going back to the ohio thing
  &apos;do you think you can still drive ?
  &apos;uh ,  i &apos;m 17 what do you mean still &apos;
 my grandma is over 95 and is doing very well for her age ,  she could probably pass a driving test ,  and the written part .
   she shouldn &apos;t be allowed to drive at night .
  night driving is something else .
  she functions almost entirely on habbit and visual cues .
  her fast-thinking problem solving abilities are basically non-existant .
  driving at night requires her to think about where shes going ,  and actually make decisions on the fly .
 at night she &apos;s gotten driven down the wrong side of the median and takes left turns from the right-hand lane .
 without her blinker .
  its like she forgets how to drive because shes so focused on finding her way .
 there could be ways to test for this ,  like testing at night as well as the day ,  but even then its different when being told where to go .
 oh like the dui breathalyzers they install on cars before you can enter ?
 error: old person breath detected step away from vehicle 
 so everyone would spend 20 minutes on the road being very careful of the speed limit and their turn signals before continuing their normal habits of weaving between 3 lanes at 80 mph
 where i live ,  it &apos;s literally  &apos;pay us $30 for a new card &apos; .
 i just renewed last week in the us and it was only 20 bucks .
 was in ky by the way .
 but you have to live in mississippi .
 it &apos;s only $25 here in texas ,  and you can even do it online .
 this should be the case ,  but many docs are hesitant to tell a patient they can &apos;t drive anymore .
 and then saying  &apos;you can &apos;t drive &apos; doesn &apos;t mean the patient will necessarily stop .
 a degree of reinforcement from the patient &apos;s family and caregivers is needed: taking away the keys and such .
 it gets murky and complicated to say the least .
 i &apos;m not sure which of those is more dangerous according to the data .
 the important thing is that self driving cars will protect me from all of them .
 or have their phone glued to their ears .
 it &apos;s really bad in our area .
 a check my grandmother wrote me is exactly how we got her to stop driving .
  unbeknownst to me ,  it had been a divisive topic amongst all my aunts and uncles at the time .
  my grandma wrote me a check for $20 for my birthday and nothing was in the right spot or on a line .
  sent to my mom to say ,  uhhh is she ok ?
  within 10 minutes i had heard from all of my aunts and uncles wanting a picture of the check .
 ugh this frustrates me so much .
 my grandmother had her licence taken away because her motor skills have deteriorated a lot (particularly her legs after hip replacement surgery) ,  and i agree with her licence being taken away ,  her driving was scary .
 but now she only has one person from the state come by once a fortnight to take her out .
 if my family can &apos;t make it one week ,  she &apos;s stuck at home for two weeks ,  it &apos;s disgusting .
 the way it works here in new zealand ,  public transport is free for anyone over 65 outside of peak hours .
 this goes quite a long way to preventing social isolation in this group
 here &apos;s the way i look at it .
  when i get to the point where i &apos;m no longer able to drive safely ,  i know there are still taxis and other car services .
  when i &apos;m no longer driving i will no longer need the $100 per month insurance ,  the average of $100 in repair cost ,  or the $75 per month for gas .
  that &apos;s $275 per month to spend on transportation .
  should cover it .
 my old folks live near a town of 90 people ,  nearest grocery is 44 miles away ,  and nearest hospital is 185 miles in another state .
 winters are cold and icy .
 they are slowly  &apos;losing it .
  &apos; it would take a serious something or other for them to move from the place they have lived since 1956 to be closer to services .
 yes ,  we &apos;ve had  &apos;the conversation &apos; .
 luckily ,  there is almost no one on the roads where they are so they hopefully are alone if they wreck .
 childrening is hard .
 i was so happy when my mom gave up driving in her late 70s .
 she saved money on car insurance and parking and could walk to the grocery ,  walgreen &apos;s ,  the hair salon ,  and michael &apos;s ,  which was 90 percent of the stuff she did anyway .
 she had family to give her rides to the doctor ,  but the car insurance and parking savings would have easily paid for taxis to the doctor .
 i work on a neuroscience unit ,  specifically the one in the hospital that gets all the strokes .
 you &apos;d be amazed at all the people that tell us they would get symptoms that would resolve themselves (a tia ,  or a mini stroke) ,  and then continue with their day ,  often which was driving .
 they would pull over ,  wait ,  and then drive .
 it &apos;s that generation my gram is 84 and doesn &apos;t want anyone waiting on her .
 if we &apos;re over and see dishes in the sink or something we could help her with we &apos;ll offer to do it and she refuses says she can do them and if you try anyway you get yelled at .
 everyone in town:  &apos;oh shit !
 brian is about to leave to get groceries !
 i &apos;d better get off the road !
 the woman who backed her car into my car at a walmart parking lot as i was honking my horn at her .
 this happened to me as well .
 i laid on the horn and she still backed into me .
 but she was probably in her 30 &apos;s and staring at her phone the whole time .
 i &apos;m guessing by over here ,  you mean europe or something ,  but in the us commercial drivers have to be tested  and receive a dot medical card saying they are fit for driving .
  has to be updated every year or every other year ,  i can &apos;t remember .
 they do vision ,  blood pressure ,  neck size ,  and various other health tests before passing .
 commercial vehicles are a whole other thing .
 uh ,  how did you knock on her window while the car was moving ?
 i am not ready to sit around telling rocking chair stories yet .
 so much in the world still needs fixing .
 we need to leave a better legacy for our grandkids and this is a good place to understand younger people &apos;s perspective .
 not all baby boomers are selfish twats .
 yeah ,  seriously ,  i know there &apos;s issues to consider with the elderly but i &apos;d rather drive next to a 60 year old grandma any day rather than a 16 year old checking social media on their iphone while they drive
 i &apos;m just hoping that self-driving cars are a thing in the next few years so that dwe (driving while elderly) becomes a criminal offence .
 just call a self-driving cab and let it do the driving .
 use the oven to heat the house .
 that is actually a thing .
 my family did that when i was growing up .
 we lived in a old house that did not have heating and the kitchen was right next to the hall for the bed rooms .
 mom would crack open the oven door and turn the oven on when it was cold in the morning and it would warm the house for us .
 i totally agree .
 i &apos;m really frustrated because my aunt lives down the street and can easily be over there helping her almost all day ,  but doesn &apos;t .
 she is supposed to be interviewing nurses/elderly care workers but its been months and i don &apos;t think she &apos;s done anything .
 i &apos;ve told my dad so many times that he needs to just step in and make decisions because my aunt obviously can &apos;t handle it .
 he doesn &apos;t want to cause a stir in the family and hurt my aunts feelings .
 it &apos;s such bullshit .
 my grandma isn &apos;t  &apos;that bad yet ,  but obviously any day she could decide to do something dangerous because she isn &apos;t thinking normally .
 really pisses me off .
 i would be over there but i live out of state .
 it &apos;s really weird when you realize every other line is a lyric from pod .
 they mean that they want a new state id ,  but can &apos;t use their current state id as an id to get their new id card .
 i didn &apos;t have my birth certificate a few years back since my parents lost it ,  so i thought clearly they could just use my past id since they required the same information when i got it the first time so they should have it on file and it wasn &apos;t like i was changing states of residence or anything .
 but of course logic doesn &apos;t apply even though you have a social security card ,  a current state id ,  and proof of residence .
 clearly you could be faking that you are a citizen if you have a current state id and social security card .
 i will never understand why they can &apos;t accept an id they issued as an id .
 va has a pretty good driver &apos;s education program .
 depending when and where you were on 95 ,  he could have just been testing how you handle parking lots .
 did you take drivers education ?
   in texas i believe if you do and they pass you then you don &apos;t need to take the driving portion .
 think youre underestimating oblivious soccer moms in their 5 , 000 lb suburbans 
 i was curious too ,  so looked it up .
 it &apos;s a mark of respect for a fallen rider ,  made by dropping the pillion pegs to signify a rider who is no longer there but would be riding if they could .
 it &apos;s the motorbike equivalent of pouring a drink to air
 they have delicate bodies
 there &apos;s been a few posts that commented on interpretation of data and how teenagers most likely get into fender benders and seniors are more likely to get into larger ,  fatal collisions .
 they found this data somewhere in the study and i wasn &apos;t able to find it .
 i will say that it is a lot harder to keep an older trauma victim alive than it is to keep a younger trauma victim alive .
 a younger trauma victim &apos;s body will be able to compensate really well and tolerate more procedures and medications being thrown at them .
 there &apos;s also less of a chance of comorbidities .
 for instance ,  an older person with with a history of atrial fibrillation ,  diabetes mellitus ,  hyperlipidemia ,  impaired renal function ,  and a damaged liver is going to be able to tolerate a lot less medications and will require several more medications to compensate for what we need to administer .
 yes ,  those people are absolutely correct that statistics are just that ,  statistics .
 however ,  they are doing the same thing and reading into those same numbers without cause of those numbers in the first place .
 also ,  how many younger people can we bring back with cpr ?
 how many older people have filled out dnr &apos;s ?
 i see the highest death rates among the oldest in the population with unclear causation of increasing death rates in any population .
 source: emergency nurse .
 ironically ,  the reason everywhere in the us is 21+ for drinking is because the federal government would grant states that changed to that minimum gramts for highway infrastructure and the like .
 its up to the states to decide ,  but they all wanted that money .
 i think inexperience plays as big of ,  if not more of a role than simply age .
 new drivers will be less reliable than experienced drivers .
 if you push the age back to 18 ,  18-20 year olds will still probably have more accidents than other groups until they gain driving experience .
 the reason they &apos;re the worst is because they &apos;ve had the least amount of practice .
 if you increased the required age to drive by two years you &apos;d just shift the data by two years (except the point people start to drive worse)
 take away their license and someone has to assume those responsibilities .
 the idea is that if they are still capable of driving then there would be zero need to take away their licenses .
 take away their license and someone has to assume those responsibilities .
 while that &apos;s absolutely true ,  it &apos;s not a good argument for letting someone keep their licence when they &apos;re unfit to drive .
 they &apos;re a danger to themself and others .
 it &apos;s less likely to get in an accident because someone is doing 25 on the interstate .
 i wouldn &apos;t say that ,  that &apos;s a massive pileup waiting to happen .
 idk but i feel like driving on expressways is a lot easier than normal streets .
 no intersections and fewer things to keep in mind
 california dmvs are booked a month in advance .
 this is where things get sticky .
 i have a test for laws that goes  &apos;would this have been used inappropriately in the 50 &apos;s ?
 this fails that test as it allows officers to target groups to make their lives harder .
 well ,  i mean ,  i had my glasses on when i was driving .
 (on a serious note ,  do you make them do the eye chart with glasses on ?
 i can &apos;t remember having to do that at most appointments; the doc usually just skips to ,   &apos;how bad is your vision without glasses ?
  &apos; and  &apos;which is better ,  1 or 2 ?
 i just stay away from the blurs and do what they do .
 i was 17 when i took the vision test for my license .
 the guy doing the vision test had me look into a little box ,  and asked me  &apos;which of these signs is farthest away ?
  &apos; i have no vision issues of any kind ,  and great depth perception ,  but for the life of me i couldn &apos;t tell .
 i answered him honestly (if sarcastically) and said ,   &apos;i don &apos;t know ,  they &apos;re all about 10 inches away in a wooden box .
  &apos; all he said was  &apos;uhuh &apos; ,  and passed me .
 he probably just thought i was some asshole kid ,  but he didn &apos;t do anything to follow up me saying ,  very clearly ,  that i couldn &apos;t tell .
 seeing how the stereotype of a dmv worker is an embittered and disgruntled employee ,  i could see why .
 they don &apos;t want them to come back .
 one person passed is another person they don &apos;t have to deal with again
 cause getting paid shitty wages tends to make people do shitty jobs
 holy shit ,  scotch and benzos .
 state police : you want us to to expose what a full shit job our brothers in the county are ?
 police protect the police .
 pull those battery connections off at every opportunity 
 we did this with my 95 year old grandpa .
 it was an older car so he believed it kept having trouble .
 he eventually decided the car was not worth the hassle and my dad sold it for him .
 he decided he was too old to buy a new one .
 easiest solution ever !
 driving isn &apos;t a freedom ,  it &apos;s a privilege 
 mine got a new car every two years or so .
 trees kept running out into the road in front of her .
 no one ever said a thing .
 i was very young .
 i hope she never hurt anyone 
 we have to have an alternative for the elderly if we &apos;re going to improve our odds of getting them off the roads when they no longer qualify .
 i &apos;m currently paid through medicaid to take care of my disabled dad (like many families in my boat .
 all of that money goes back to his care) .
 it would be cool to see a similar program set up for the designated driver of someone who has failed their driving test and/or has a debilitating condition ,  like dementia .
 time constraints can make transporting the elderly difficult ,  and some just may not be able to afford the additional cost .
 my dad lives a 20 minute round trip away ,   taking him to his doctor and back takes an hour ,  etc .
 i go to my dad &apos;s almost daily .
 i can see why it would be rough driving an elderly relative .
 and i get why a relative would cling to being able to drive because of that .
 many elderly women in my grandma &apos;s social circle couldn &apos;t drive ,  so they would turn a blind eye to their husband &apos;s medical issues ,  not wanting to face it .
 one &apos;s husband was being pulled over by the police .
 he had dementia .
 he let them on a high speed chase ,  crashed into the back of a semi .
 he was the only death ,  thankfully ,  no one else hurt .
 when my grandfather went into a home ,  we parked his car outside of his window .
 he wasn &apos;t allowed to leave the facility ,  but the illusion of independence helped him transition .
 see a test wouldn &apos;t be bad .
 my grandmother is 69 and she drives fine and would pass no problem .
 she goes the speed limit and uses her blinker and all that .
 we in illinois really know how to pick em .
 i &apos;m beginning to think i could write for the onion .
 is that what the kids are doing these days ?
 i &apos;m gonna die a virgin :(
 i &apos;ll be darned ,  is this random or is this name a reference ?
 had this discussion the other day with a friend ,  about how we likely will not get to retire with ss or if it does exist it won &apos;t be a liveable amount .
 retirement at 65 will be a luxury only .
 this old guy (who has been on disability for years for being  &apos;nuts &apos; as he says himself) butted in with  &apos;retired people today get social security because they paid plenty into it !
 millenials just want it for free without paying a penny !
 sure that &apos;s exactly the reason .
 that &apos;s kind of weird .
  was the seziure not related to the surgery ?
  i would think the doctor would say  &apos;oh yeah ,  you just had a psychogenic seizure from the anesthesia .
  you &apos;re not actually epileptic ,  so i &apos;m not going to suspend your license .
 this is such a good idea .
 my friend &apos;s mum has ms ,  and they specifically moved from a suburban to a more urban area (with many services available locally ,  and express trains to thencity centre from a fully accessible train station) just so that she could maintain her independence as her physical condition deteriorates .
 and sure enough ,  i see her around when i am there ,  having a coffee with friends in a café ,  etc .
  ,  despite the fact that she is sadly in quite a physically immobile condition .
 in contrast ,  some people i think are way too attached to where they live .
 someone in my parents &apos; hilly ,  car dependent suburb (you could not ride a wheelchair on the footpaths as they are narrow ,  steep and in poor condition) was installing an elevator in their house .
 great for in-house accessibility ,  but assuming that that person can &apos;t drive (nay not be the case here ,  would definitely be the case for a % of people in their suburb who are aging) ,  they will be 100% dependent on someone else even to reach the local shops .
 i lived in europe ,  in really accessible areas ,  for a few years and it amazed me how many people with mobility difficulties i saw out and about (from the very elderly and frail to parents with severely disabled children) .
 i wondered why so many locals seemed to have disabilities .
 then i realised that it &apos;s probably about the same proportion as at home - it &apos;s just that in the suburbs ,  those people (and their carers ,  in some cases) are basically trapped in their homes and probably don &apos;t get out nearly as much .
 i will never forget seeing a boy with very severe disabilities (electric wheelchair with a lot of straps ,  so very limited mobility ,  would have been difficult for him to transfer into a car) and his dad sitting in an open air terrace café with the dad &apos;s friend .
 both looked so happy ,  to be out and about and with friends ,  or just out in the fresh air .
 social model of disability ftw .
 you have given me something to think about .
  &apos;we had to say dickety because the kaiser had stolen our word twenty .
  &apos;here &apos;s your tickety &apos; .
 i used to grandpa-sit a guy in his early 90s who thought that since his dl was still valid (they &apos;re good for 10 years here) he was ok to drive .
 despite having balance & muscle control issues .
 of course ,  one of his sons (maybe in his 50s ?
 ) had worse issues ,  couldn &apos;t use his hands ,  drank lots of alcohol ,  yet still drove .
 apparently his family didn &apos;t realize those last 2 parts .
 don &apos;t think they &apos;d take the test if they &apos;re willing to admit they aren &apos;t still fit to drive .
 no ,  like the videos on those websites of attractive young girls taking driving lessons but doing terribly ,  so they work something out with the instructor .
 i was thinking we should have random people tail someone and test them that way and then i realized we have police that do that
 i mean ,  using that logic there &apos;s no point in ever having a driving exam to begin with .
 it &apos;s just 20 minutes of them pretending to be cautious and then they go on to drive however they &apos;re going to drive regardless of the rules ,  right ?
 actually ,  i &apos;ve seen the opposite .
  i work in a primary care clinic and if a provider notices that you probably should not be driving (for example: just suffered a stroke and don &apos;t have that coordination back yet ,  if you can get it back; your parkinson &apos;s has gotten worse; reports from family that you &apos;ve been having difficulty with memory or other coordination issues) they will have no problem telling the dmv to revoke your license .
  they may not tell you that they were the reporter .
  to get their license back the patients have to go to a separate testing center that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with or is connected to the dmv ,  and they have to pass a written test and a physical test .
  the provider then gets that recommendation and then will pass that onto the dmv for reinstatement if that &apos;s the case .
 honestly ,  your primary care provider does not want to find out that you hit a pedestrian ,  caused an accident ,  or died going to the grocery store .
  we prefer you pissed off and yelling at us rather than injured/dead .
 many docs are hesitant to tell a patient they can &apos;t drive anymore .
 my mom had alzheimer &apos;s .
  her neurologist told my dad  &apos;if you ever have to give her bad news related to the diagnosis ,  whether or not it &apos;s from me ,  tell her i said so .
  &apos;  this meant things like driving (she &apos;d already voluntarily stopped driving prior to that ,  so that didn &apos;t matter) ,  any types of therapy or doctor appointments she might not want to go to ,  the daycare she eventually went into ,  etc .
  everything was his fault ,  so it wouldn &apos;t be our fault .
  as far as the doctor was concerned ,  he saw her once every few months ,  and we saw her daily ,  and he had more authority than we did .
 i wish more doctors were like him .
 self driving cars will protect me from all of them .
 and speeding ,  and tiredness ,  and road rage ,  and people showing off in front of their friends ,  and people getting distracted ,  and people using their phones ,  and people not reacting fast enough ,  and people who are inconsiderate drivers ,  .
 honestly ,  self-driving cars can &apos;t come soon enough .
 once you start to think through the implications are incredible .
 and once the tech gets good enough there &apos;ll be no more (or drastically reduced) traffic accidents ,  no more traffic jams ,  no need for road signs or traffic lights ,  reduced pollution ,  the list goes on and on .
 a lot of states have elderly bus and non medical ambulances to take the elderly and disabled to appointments ,  around town ,  and unlike a regular bus ,  they &apos;ll go door to door .
 my grandpa uses the program and uses it to stay independent .
 that is why every city/county needs to have decent elderly housing that all seniors can qualify for (though in some areas in the us this definitely already exists to a degree .
 ) it just solves so many problems - especially the social aspect - by putting seniors in their  &apos;own &apos; communities .
 i have to admit that it is an extremely complicated issue all around ,  both morally and fiscally .
 just how much of our tax money should go towards the elderly ?
 it is tough for me to justify in my head why a nation should spend a ton of money on the elderly while so many of our youth are so underprivileged .
 then i realize that if we just allocated 3-4% of our national defense budget for seniors and at-risk youth it would seemingly take care of several major issues in both categories .
 when my moms cancer spread to her brain she started having seizures ,  and they told her she couldn &apos;t drive any more .
 maybe it depends on the locality 
  &apos;you can &apos;t park there .
  the no parking sign is down the block .
  &apos;it &apos;s brian &apos;s grocery day .
  &apos;brian takes that corner very ,  very wide ,  and he &apos;ll hit you if you park there .
 my sister was intentionally told by my cousin to drive into a (rather small) ditch when she was learning how to drive because my grandpa was driving down the road towards them .
 it was 100% the right move for their safety .
 why neck size though ?
 she &apos;s old ,  she was obviously driving slowly
 they were in the passenger seat
 now i just want to pour you a miralax on the rocks with a shot of vodka and get you on a bus to the white house so you can raise hell
 i always leave the oven open after using it ,  i already paid for the heat may as well get two birds stoned at once
 correlation doesn &apos;t necessarily imply causation ,  but it does point its fingers furtively and waggle its eyebrows suggestively while mouthing  &apos;over there !
 it &apos;s because you can &apos;t get up to any sort of dangerous speed when some moron is driving ten below the speed limit in the passing lane .
 as a northern virginia resident that socks me .
 it &apos;s either fatal or it isn &apos;t !
 fewest fatal accidents per capita .
 yes ,  in tx you must drive and you must go through course material ,  but the test is not vigorous in the slightest .
 i bombed parallel parking and still got my license .
 will add that the written test is legitimately common sense and not hard to pass in the slightest ,  even someone who didn &apos;t pay attention to the couse material would pass
 can confirm here as well ,  it was a decent test ,  and maybe that &apos;s why i think dc and maryland drivers are terrible drivers .
 also in my county (fairfax county) ,  we had classroom instruction sophomore/junior year during gym time (like they would do for sex ed .
 ) dedicated to driving .
 although ,  i wasn &apos;t a fan of where they told me to put my hands ,  supposedly you are to put them at 4 and 8 instead of 10 and 2 .
 i also didn &apos;t follow the thing where they wanted us to angle the mirror outwards instead of inwards so that it covered the blind spot ,  like literally 15 degrees outwards ,  so you don &apos;t see any of your car or what &apos;s next to you ,  but rather what &apos;s in your blind spot .
 i didn &apos;t do that because i always look over without exception .
  &apos;when i die ,  i want to go peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather .
 not yelling and screaming like the passengers in his car .
 way of having non mandated mandated drinking age .
 thats one reason .
 the other reason is teenagers make stupid choices .
 source: i was a teenager involved in several accidents and other various speeding related infractions .
 nah ,  it &apos;s not just the lack of experience ,  it &apos;s the massive immaturity in that age range .
 if you started learning to drive at 30 you would be vastly better than someone at 16 just by virtue of not being an immature asshole .
 yes ,  but when you make a mistake on a side street ,  the chance of being killed s quite low .
  the chance of death from an accident driving over 40 mph increases dramatically ,  and ramps up strongly at 50 mph .
 also ,  an accident on a side street normally involves 1-2 cars .
  on an expressway ,  it can easily become a multi-car pile up .
 i think it has to do with speed mostly .
 i generally agree that on the expressways you have less opportunities to get into an accident ,  but if you do it &apos;s probably going to be more serious just because of the speeds involved .
 you also have to be careful not to zone out which can be pretty easy .
 what do you mean in the 50s ?
 there are still people who are pulled over for driving while mexican
 i work at a driver licensing office .
 maybe i can help for clarity .
 when it comes to depth perception ,  we need to give that part of the test but you can &apos;t technically fail that part where i &apos;m at .
 if your depth perception sucks i need to tell you that objects may be closer than they appear ,  but we licence those with vision in only one eye ,  which is 0 depth perception .
 as long as you have 20/30 vision ,  no diplopia ,  and adequate peripheral vision (120°) ,  you &apos;re likely to pass .
 and not severely colour blind .
 mine asked me to read the letters and i just laughed .
 all i saw was a yellow light .
 no letters whatsoever .
 no shapes even .
 one yellow blurry light .
 which i still don &apos;t understand because ,  length of waiting in line aside ,  i have had nothing but great experiences with very helpful employees in my 30 years .
 something about benzos ,  especially mixed with alciohol ,  brings out the absolute worst in people .
 turns normally honest people into thieves ,  and makes the most outlandish crazy ideas seem positively brilliant .
 then there &apos;s the belligerence .
 the worst part is ,  you always think you &apos;re acting fine ,  totally sober .
 meanwhile you &apos;re walking around like hunter s on ether ,  slurring incoherently ,  and there &apos;s melted ice cream and sweet tarts coating your mouth and shirt .
 people on benzos are a fucking nightmare to deal with ,  especially if it &apos;s a friend ,  now you &apos;re babysitting the most petulant ,  disagreeable toddler ,  except they &apos;re a 25 y .
 piss in the blinkerfluid reservoir ,  remove muffler bearings and drain the sparks 
 remove main relay .
 remove fuel pump relay or fuse .
 unplug ignition module .
 unplug trans shifter postion sensor (stops .
 starter from engaging) .
 unplug starter solenoid activation wire .
 remove ignition rotor (if applicable) .
 unplug injectors or coil packs .
 remove feed wire to main fuse/relay box .
 i don &apos;t think they &apos;re mutually exclusive .
 i agree that driving is a privilege ,  but it &apos;s a privilege that grants the elderly mobility and freedom that they know is slowly slipping from their grasp .
 i &apos;m definitely not advocating for unsafe elderly driving; i was just pointing out that i understood their strong reluctance to give it up .
 driving is a privilege not a right .
 no offense to anyone &apos;s grandparents/parents but if they are a danger to other drivers or pedestrians the need to be retested and have visual exams every single year and ensure they can physically drive .
 arthritic legs are slower to move which slows down reaction time greatly .
 i cannot wait for self driving cars to become cheaper so old people can afford them because although driving is not a right ,  it does represent freedom to older people and people with disabilities .
 no one wants to be a burden on their friends and family .
 oh ,  guess it &apos;s your turn to drive grandma around all day this time .
 no one wants that .
 self driving cars will improve everyone &apos;s lives .
 definitely agree that age restrictions shouldn &apos;t be too linear and should require testing .
 one of my grandmothers passed away two years ago at 77 of cancer ,  and she was a perfectly fine driver .
 i don &apos;t think i recall ever hearing of even a minor accident involving her in my life .
 while my other grandmother is almost 70 now and should not be driving .
 it isn &apos;t the age that diminishes your ability to drive ,  it &apos;s the physical and mental conditions that accompany age ,  which affect people completely differently .
 testing makes this distinction far better than age ever can by itself .
 mine probably would too .
 her only hang up is on the highway .
 she says seventy is too fast/dangerous except going so much slower than everyone else is also dangerous which i could not make her understand .
 looks at camera 
 are any of your governors not in federal prison ?
 a safe stay-at-home job .
 it &apos;ll keep you off the streets and safe from those old people who keep running over young people !
 coming to terms with yourself ,  and how you treat yourself ,  is technically a relationship - right ?
 til i &apos;m not paying into social security 
 no ,  dumbass ,  the social security coming out of my paycheck is going to you ,  because your parents &apos; generation fucked too much .
 there &apos;s too many of you for the system to support; when it gets to be our turn ,  the system will have already collapsed because your collective fat assess strained it too much .
 he &apos;s not nuts ,  he &apos;s retarded .
 same in canada - doctors in some provinces must report any condition that could mean you should not drive .
 well ,  until they are sure its not a recurring thing ,  better safe than sorry - after all ,  the doctor still gets to drive even if you don &apos;t .
 but if he doesn &apos;t report ,  he could lose his (more valuable) medical license .
 anything that results in blackouts ,  automatic suspension .
 one of my very good friends (also my former boss) is quadriplegic .
 making the world more accessible makes disabled people able to be a part of society and be treated as ,  well ,  people .
 so i tied an onion to my belt ,  which was the style at the time .
 you live in florida ,  don &apos;t you ?
 you underestimate the stupidity and complexity of human nature .
 depends on how it &apos;s worded .
  &apos;are you aware  that driving with a known impairment (eye sight/slowed reaction) is just as dangerous as driving drunk or under the influence of drugs ?
 on a similar note ,  i wonder what impairing drugs these oldies are driving on ?
 we have police that do that .
 police are supposed to do that .
 this sounds like the best idea so far .
 is this in the us ?
 unfortunately where my grandma lives (outer suburbs of brisbane) there isn &apos;t a service like this ,  as far as i know .
 my grandmother used a service like this when she could still get out .
 she would go to the store and shop for herself and just get out of the house .
 unfortunately the shuttle stopped doing the elderly rides .
 she started using a service that was funded by the state i think .
 it was kind of like uber but for the elderly .
 she stopped using it because the drivers were rude or always late and she had to cancel a few important doctors appointments because she was never picked up .
 this is a great idea ,  but not a replacement for good transportation options .
 getting your driver &apos;s license pulled is a bitter pill ,  but bedding to sell your house and move into a dorm for old folks is worse for many people .
 these people specifically weren &apos;t going to the doctor &apos;s at all after .
 they figured since the symptoms resolved ,  then they &apos;re okay ,  so they never go .
 edit i do think you can &apos;t drive though legally after having a seizure (in my state at least) for a certain amount of time .
 i had a friend have a seizure and told not to drive .
 she ignored it .
 if you have thick neck ,  you &apos;re more likely to experience sleep apnea apparently .
  or it &apos;s how i understood it .
  i knew a guy who couldn &apos;t get his dot medical card due to his neck size ,  albeit he was a fairly large guy .
  &apos;the dot currently wants anyone with a bmi of 35 or greater to have a sleep study performed as well as anyone with a neck size of 17 inches or greater (for males) and 16 inches or greater (for females) to have a sleep study done .
 i &apos;ll take the vodka straight if you don &apos;t mind ,  and i did raise a little hell in the 60 &apos;s .
 i think i can remember how to do it .
 my city even has special  &apos;cabs &apos; for elderly people .
 senior citizen thing that they make appointments with ahead of time for things like appointments ,  getting groceries ,  etc .
 not sure how far in advance u have to call but it &apos;s not weeks .
 maybe a day or two .
 i mean worse case ontario is you trip over the open oven door .
 pretty sure virginia has state inspections so vehicles on the road there tend to be in better condition or just flat out newer .
 the latter results in vehicles that are significantly safer .
 my boss &apos;s wife was hit by a semi in 2015 encore ,  rolled 6 times .
 she walked away with a few bruises and a sprained wrist .
 likely would have been dead if the car was 15-20 years older .
 exactly ,  new mexico has just as or probably even more rigorous a test as virginia ,  and we &apos;re pretty high up there on bad drivers/accidents/fatal crashes .
 as someone from richmond this shoes me .
 i’ve literally never parallel parked in my life .
 fortunately for me ,  i’m not stupid enough to try it before i actually practice it .
 but i didn’t even have to take a driving test when i got my license .
 texas dmv is a joke .
 ah i always tell the version  &apos; .
 makes for more horror .
 they couldn &apos;t get the votes for it so the government blackmailed the states .
 right ,  you &apos;d still have a higher rate for the 30 year olds if that was the minimum age for driving ,  but it would be much lower than it is for 16 y/o &apos;s .
 he just means abused moreso .
 we licence those with vision in only one eye .
 how do these people get judged to have adequate peripheral vision when they have no peripheral vision on one side ?
 i know you don &apos;t make the rules but it scares me .
 i suppose ,  though ,  that an alert driver with one eye is probably safer than someone pointing both eyes at their phone to text .
 they had to point me to the half-dollar-sized blue mark for my photo ,  and then proceeded to conduct the vision test without my glasses and got pissed when i told them i couldn &apos;t see anything .
 christ ,  the line was 30 years long ?
 damn ,  that &apos;s actually pretty surprising .
  the dmv employees around here really are just the nastiest people .
  then again ,  they &apos;re dealing with the people on a daily basis that are dumb as a brick and don &apos;t understand instructions no matter how many times/ways you tell it .
 it depends on the dmv .
  i migrated to ohio for a while ,  their dmvs (at least the ones i went to) were like country clubs compared to the ones in west virginia (circa huntington area) .
  if you want to get anything done back home ,  or if you wanted it done fast it was quicker to drive nearly an hour to the next closest dmv (and the lines are shorter to boot) .
 man i &apos;m hypersensitive to benzos ,  which pretty much just means i go right into the belligerent stage no matter how small the dose ,  but doctors never believe me for some reason .
 had to get surgery a few years back ,  they convinced me to take a xanax since i wouldn &apos;t be having general anesthetic .
 spent the whole operation swearing like a drunken sailor and had to be strapped down .
 it &apos;s fucking scary being that far out of control of your actions .
 on top of all that ,  alcohol and benzos are the only two drugs that will kill you outright if you go cold turkey .
 i can &apos;t imagine how low chances of survival are from withdrawing on both .
 so ,  just steal the car one piece at a time ?
 if you do all that i guarantee not many people would be able to start the car !
 i agree ,  my grandma did the same thing so we just started driving her everywhere .
 it was easier though since she &apos;s had one of us grandkids living with her for the last few years .
 they really did not know how to pick em
 please don &apos;t jim the camera like that .
 you pay into the current people &apos;s social security .
 they didn &apos;t even pay as much as we do .
 same in canada - doctors in some provinces must report any condition that could mean you should not drive .
 that makes entirely too much sense .
 my father is an optometrist in new jersey ,  he is prohibited from reporting to the state people who have medical conditions that disqualify them from driving .
 i didn &apos;t have any white onions ,  because of the war .
 the only thing you could get was those big yellow ones .
 yeah ,  there &apos;s a reason why some people fail tests for not entering their own name correctly .
 if they actually enforced the vehicle code you would have so many people complaining because they can &apos;t drive recklessly anymore .
 yep ,  i can &apos;t confirm for all states but i &apos;m in mn .
  for those of you who may be wondering how often it happens ,  i am in contact with probably 600 patients per year and in the last 3 months i &apos;ve been involved with about 8 or 10 patients that we &apos;ve had to refer to the testing facility .
  there &apos;s about 10 or 15 more we &apos;re keeping on radar .
  maybe doesn &apos;t happen as often as it should ,  but we try !
 state inspections are not a thing everywhere ?
 you also have i-40 .
 i can &apos;t count the amount of times i &apos;ve been cruising through nm on i-40 trying to gtfo there whilst struggling to stay awake .
 god that &apos;s one boring killer drive .
 why grandma ,  what soft skin you have
 the deal about licensing one eyed people and needing peripheral vision seem contradictory .
 my elder sister is blind in one eye due to an accident from when we were younger .
 she &apos;s been driving since she passed her test and has never been in any driving incident of any kind .
 not even a parking ticket .
 she knows she has depth perception issues so she is constantly careful about it .
 sometimes meaning she leaves gaps between her and the other car that are annoyingly big .
 she tends to use fixed points and stuff that she knows how far away from her as land marks of sort .
 kind of like the two second rule where you let a car pass an object and count the time it takes for you to reach it .
 i have refractive amblyopia .
 my brain doesn &apos;t really process any of the input coming from my left eye .
 but i also don &apos;t really have functionally worse vision than anyone else .
 sure ,  my depth perception is shit and i don &apos;t have full peripheral range on that side but i &apos;m also aware that i need to actually turn my head to see certain things better
 i got passed with vision in one eye .
 i have no peripheral vision on one side .
 all i have to do is turn my head slightly more to make extra sure there are no cars next to me when i merge or get into another lane .
 doesn &apos;t mean i keep my head turned away for forever .
 it takes literally a quick glance to turn further to the side than usual and then turn back .
 i also don &apos;t drive like a fucking idiot and make a bunch of lane changes when i don &apos;t really need to to also help me cut down the chance of side-swiping someone .
 i also will plan exiting the freeway/turning far in advance .
 i &apos;ll get in the exiting lane far before the turn/exit so that i don &apos;t have to make any rush judgments before turning .
 i am an alert driver with one eye ,  exactly as you said .
 my depth perception is not great but that doesn &apos;t mean i literally can &apos;t tell how far something is at all .
 of course i can ,  it &apos;s just not as sharp as others with full vision may have .
 i can tell when i &apos;m getting too close to someone and i instantly correct myself .
 i literally have empty holes where my eyes should be ,  and they passed me .
 stupid question ,  we are talking about the dmv
 and that was just to get the queue waiting number .
 sometimes when i encounter nasty people really it &apos;s just my own bad mood to that &apos;s getting in the way of a decent encounter .
 i have had legitimately rude government employees deal with me in the past .
 the people who screen calls for my county &apos;s help center have never ever seemed pleased to help me .
 more annoyed to have to look something up for me than anything .
 but again ,  i need to be careful when i &apos;m pointing fingers .
 i can always find something wrong with someone else .
 but it blinds me to my own shit that &apos;s also getting in the way of a good experience !
 glad some of you have nice friendly dmv employees .
 they must be getting compensated fairly for their time .
 have you reported any benzo as an allergy/sensitivity ?
 genuinely curious because no doctor i &apos;ve ever had would &apos;ve given me that class of medication for any kind of procedure i &apos;ve had if i had told them that i didn &apos;t want it .
 i just have to say i &apos;ve never enjoyed reading a post quite so much .
 the doctors don &apos;t believe that you experience paradoxical effects from benzodiazepines ,  even though paradoxical effects are extremely well documented ?
 holy fuck your doctors sound incredibly ignorant of medicine .
 it won &apos;t cost him a dime .
 unfortunately ,  in big cities ,  you end up walking a lot .
 and i know elderly people who can &apos;t walk much ,  but can get into the drivers seat .
 we &apos;re dealing with this in our family .
 grandma wants to get out to the park ,  to see grandpa (another facility) ,  etc .
 everyone (including her) agree it &apos;s time to give up the car ,  she hasn &apos;t driven in months and her health is failing ,  but she &apos;s desperately clinging to the idea of driving locally and retaining freedom .
 going out without help ,  to them ,  means walking 1 block to the coffee shop next to the retirement home .
 self driving cars ,  hopefully soon .
 instead ,  old people should be driving golf carts or newer cars that are capable of automatically braking once they &apos;ve hit something (that &apos;s what essentially happened during the terrorist attack in france ,  the stolen truck was modern enough to automatically apply the brakes once the driver purposefully collided with people) .
 i can &apos;t wait for brand new modern cars to become used and filter down to everyone .
 it will be so much more safer .
 my nissan displays a 360 degree view when i &apos;m in parking or reversing mode .
 it will not let you set off without a seatbelt on in the drivers seat .
 if you don &apos;t indicate while changing lanes it will bleep at you loudly and that would get annoying quickly .
 it tells you if someone in is your blind spot and shows where they are on your mirror .
 it scans ahead at night to warn you of vehicles ahead without lights on .
 it can track a car then automatically keep at the same speed and brake when it does .
 the brakes will also cut in if you hit something .
 the safest speed is the same speed as everyone else .
 it &apos;s the ones that are too different that cause problems every time .
 that seems understandable on the surface to me .
 in my experience ,  people tend to err on the side of slightly above the speed limit on highways .
 if i &apos;m right about that ,  it makes sense that someone doing the opposite would disrupt traffic more and therefore cause more issues .
 i recall seeing something to the effect that for every 10 mph slower than the prevailing traffic flow you go - you basically double your chances to be involved in a collision .
 going 45 on 70 (let &apos;s be fair ,  everyone is doing 80) is a death wish (but legal) .
 i wish i could do that for my grandma .
 my brother and i are the oldest grandchildren and we live eight hours away and the two who live close to her are under ten .
 she &apos;s got spunk though .
 she went zip lining in like paraguay or something on a mission trip .
 so i think my aunt and uncle just try to keep her local when she drives herself .
 yeah ,  you should send it to them and tell us what happens
 when social security was established ,  you paid in advance and the money got invested .
 lbj did away with that to introduce medicare on a  &apos;balanced budget &apos; .
 he was a real bastard .
 turned it into a pyramid scheme .
 well it would likely stop people from going to the doctor to avoid the chance of losing their license
 now ,  to take the ferry cost a nickel ,  and in those days ,  nickels had pictures of bumblebees on  &apos;em .
  &apos;gimme five bees for a quarter ,  &apos; you &apos;d say .
 sometimes ,  i hear things that make me go  &apos;fuck wisconsin .
  &apos; but ,  if i hear an out of stater say those things ,  they better be ready to get chewed out .
 or just a dirty look .
 that &apos;s a fear i didn &apos;t know i had .
 not only that ,  but: .
 why the fuck aren &apos;t they out there solving real crimes and catching criminals ?
 the police are nothing but a revenue gathering gang .
 i can &apos;t speak for the us ,  but that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;d hear where i &apos;m from .
 hey thanks for telling me about these associations !
 i replied thisto someone else ,  we &apos;re in the process of moving her into an aged care facility /home ,  just difficult when we live on the west coast (and moving her here is not an option)
 here in kansas you see people drive all kinds of crazy looking beaters .
 just have to make sure i’m not pumping out too much cancer .
 anything else is ok .
 could be something like: a person with one eye is more likely to heed advice such as  &apos;keep in mind ,  since you have an eye missing you do not have enough peripheral vision on your left side ,  so you need to get in the habit of checking that side more often &apos; .
 someone with two eyes and bad peripheral vision might not be as likely to listen to similar advice .
 i &apos;m like your sister ,  and from my experience i would say that the brain still does most of the depth perception based on experience .
 the only one case  where i know i &apos;m missing on something is when an object like a ball flies straight towards me ,  since i can &apos;t see the parabola i can &apos;t tell where it &apos;s going .
 playing volleyball in hs ,  i was good except for those very embarrassing moments when i go forward and the ball flies over me .
 never had this issue while driving though ,  and once you get used to turn your head around peripheral vision is not an issue too
 get up on out of here with my eyeholes !
 i literally have eyes blazing with the fiery conflagration of hell ,  like two burning coals where my eyes should be ,  surrounded by pitch darkness ,  like a void in space ,  and they passed me .
 well i &apos;m ants in my eyes johnson ,  everything &apos;s black ,  i can &apos;t see a thing ,  and i also can &apos;t feel anything either !
 so what kind of bmw are you thinking of getting ?
 i literally didn &apos;t exist ,  and they passed me .
 done with the queue when youre dead .
 then they tell you that you have the wrong form
 all i know is when i see a new doctor and say i can &apos;t have benzos but it &apos;s not an allergy ,  they give me this look like  &apos;yeah ok &apos; ,  and when i had that bad surgery the doctor told me i &apos;d be fine with just one xanax .
 they seem to think i &apos;m just looking for something to feel special ,  i dunno .
 i did have surgery last month for a deviated septum ,  though ,  and the anesthesiologist for that was the first medical person i &apos;ve had who took it seriously .
 he even had someone ready to hold me down in case i reacted to whatever he was pumping into me .
 i  worked for an old lady once .
 about 93 years old bent out of age with a walking stick .
 she wore like a half inch thick glasses .
 she was like 4 foot 5 .
 so am working in her house and she tells me she is going to the store .
 so i ask if a cab or uber is picking her up .
 it is just two miles away and am driving down there .
 she drives a 2002 buick lesabre .
 so i ask her if i could take her .
 so i ask ,  how do you drive .
 i mean she can &apos;t even reach the pedals .
 she told me that she puts the walking stick through the steering wheel and uses it as a  &apos;foot &apos; to alternate between the brake and accelerator .
 ah ,  perverse incentive !
  same reason why you won &apos;t be reported for buying condoms below the age of consent .
  better have people fucking safely ,  than afraid to buy what they need .
 good christ the simpsons was glorious in it &apos;s time .
 oh ,  i regularly have those moments - bad drivers (i live in milwaukee ,  obviously) ,  snow ,  cold ,  snow & bad drivers ,  too many harleys ,  snow ,  potholes ,  the high rate of violence in my city ,  people wearing foam cheese hats on national tv .
 but there are some pretty awesome people & sights here too .
 get out of the cities & people are generally pretty nice .
 i &apos;ve thoroughly enjoyed riding through the north woods ,  aside from being concerned about hitting a deer .
 some people just don &apos;t realise that the police has different departments .
 in my country ,  the road police has nothing to do with non-road crimes .
 to my knowledge ,  i can drive anything that &apos;s properly registered .
 20 year old truck that &apos;s trying very hard to fold in the middle ?
 sure ,  i see a couple a month .
 clapped out rust heap with bald tires ,  no exhaust ,  and crap brakes ?
 as long as it doesn &apos;t get pulled over ,  they &apos;ll keep driving it .
 perhaps mn has some sort of inspections ,  but i &apos;ve never had one or heard of anyone getting one .
 person with one eye here ,  you don &apos;t need to warn of anything ,  checking blindspots and being critical of an objects apparent distance becomes part of life .
 people don &apos;t usually just lose an eye and act like they still have two
 i have no vision in my left eye .
 this is exactly what i do .
 really not that difficult .
 my vision has never once gotten me into an accident .
 i don &apos;t know why people are so appalled people with vision in one eye can drive .
 but did you pass the test ?
 when they gave you the form in the first place
 sweet ,  sweet judith .
 never would put her foot down .
 such a kind woman .
 jim died yesterday and it &apos;s been very lonely please call
 it would be pretty unethical to report underage people for buying condoms .
 why would you want to punish or scare them for that .
 if you don &apos;t want to die: .
 drink every time someone admits they were wrong .
 one shot for every  &apos;no one is above the law &apos;
 if you still have a witches hat laying around from halloween ,  you can have a person wear it .
 it &apos;ll rotate around the room on time or whenever a new person is introduced during proceedings .
 whenever the term witch hunt is used you all scream burn the witch and the person in the hat takes a shot of fireball
 most of these suggestions are jokes about drinking continuously but if you want a drinking game that’s really about the fundamental impact of the hearings:  .
 every time a witness suddenly realizes “oh no ,  i shouldn’t have said that .
 every time a gop questioner suddenly realizes “oh no ,  i shouldn’t have asked that .
 every time a carefully crafted narrative falls apart and the witness is redirected into explaining a contradiction between their testimony and;  .
 (a) previous statements ,          .
 (b) previous testimony ,         .
 (c) written evidence .
 when it goes to the senate i’m going to tape a cherry tomato to my tv and see how many times mcconnell’s mouth goes near it .
 hello all you youtube channels and clickbait  &apos;news &apos; websites shamelessly stealing the responses from this and claiming them as your own .
 drink every time someone doesn &apos;t answer the question
 i don &apos;t recall = drink .
 a shot of peach shnapps (which is beyond gross ,  imho) every time you hear the word  &apos;impeach &apos; .
 a shot of jaeger every time you hear the word  &apos;tremendous &apos;
 international drinking rules : .
 every time a county is name checked in the impeachment hearing ,  you must drink a shot of the most famous national drink .
 russia - vodka  .
 ukraine - horlika  .
 if there &apos;s anything we should have learned in the last few years ,  it &apos;s that there are no rules .
 drink whenever ,  and then try to dodge the consequences the day after .
 rule 1: drink heavily to dull the pain .
 rule 2: there is no rule 2 .
 take a drink every time russia is mentioned .
 there’s gonna be a lot of people needing liver transplants after this week .
 drink every time pbs is threatened with defunding
 if we turn the impeachment hearings into a drinking game ,  we better have a death count on the screen to ,  to count how many people got alcohol poisoning from playing the drinking game
 take a shot every time you hear quid pro quo and try not to die .
 every time gym jordan doesn &apos;t have on a jacket .
 take a shot every time one of the following is mentioned: .
 take a shot every time someone: .
 makes a question irrelevant to the proceedings to try and confuse the issue .
 brings up whataboutism .
 dodges the question instead of answering it .
 blames the other party .
 blames someone else not party affiliated .
 blames someone else within their party .
 returns a question with an insult instead of an answer .
 i figure you &apos;ll be unconscious within fifteen minutes to a half an hour ,  depending on your tolerance .
 take a shot whenever putin is mentioned .
 the moment anyone says anything ,  remain stone cold sober watching every last second and remembering how we wound up in this situation .
 scroll on twitter under the hashtag at the same time and drink everytime someone mentions they would start a civil war if trump is impeached
 open bottle ,  drink until empty .
 you will need it .
 i &apos;ve been playing this drinking game since 2016 .
 i &apos;m not sure how much my liver can take .
 edit-joke &apos;s on me ,  apparently imma champ .
 take a shot for every person you register to vote for the 2020 elections #democracy
 take a shot for .
 - hillary &apos;s emails .
 - if anyone says maga in its abbreviated or full form .
 - do nothing democrats .
 - a trump tweet containing the phrase  &apos;witch hunt &apos; with at least one spelling error in the tweet .
 - perfect phone call .
 finish your drink for .
 - trump promoting an anti hillary video on twitter .
 - any mention of cofveve .
 - a red herring involving ms13 .
 - any mention of xi or putin by a republican .
 power hour starts with .
 - ivanka promoting her brand or getting new chinese patents .
 - absolutely any mention of baron by a member of the trump family .
 - trump saying the words  &apos;fuck &apos; or  &apos;shit &apos; on live tv .
 holy wah ,  thanks for the plat .
 now i feel like i have to actually do this .
 take a drink anytime: .
 1)a republican complains about the process being unfair .
 2) a republican questions the motives of a witness .
 3) a republican mentions hillary ,  biden or obama .
 4) a democrat mentions russia ,  ukraine or the mueller report .
 5) anyone utters the words  &apos;quid pro quo &apos; .
 6) a republican declares the process a waste of time .
 shoot a whole bottle of jack if: .
 1)a republican admits that donald trump did something wrong .
 2) a democrat says the process is a waste of time .
 have fun and may you not get alcohol poisoning .
 maybe take a drink every time someone answers a question honestly the first time it &apos;s asked ?
 you know ,  like ,  if you have to drive afterward or something .
 can someone give me a run down on what’s happening ?
 i’m completely fucking stupid and i live under a rock .
 everytime a felony is added to the list take a drink .
 i &apos;m assuming he &apos;s going to live tweet .
 so everytime he angrily responds to an accusation take a drink .
 if his tweet mentions  &apos;witch hunt &apos; or insults the democrats take two drinks .
 if he specifically calls out nancy pelosi or aoc take three drinks .
 everytime a congress person asks a stupid question take a drink .
 everytime republicans conveniently move their criteria for impeachment take small a sip (they are going to be doing this a lot .
 you don &apos;t want to get alchohol poisoning)
 one if by land two if by sea
 trump-2-drunk drinking game .
 player(s): 1 to infinite .
 age: 18/21 (depending on legality in your region) .
 timeframe: as long as you can hold a beverage in your hand ,  because this might take awhile .
 rules: every player sits in front of the tv ,  with a beverage in hand (you should choose a good session beverage ,  this is going to get you proper fucked) .
 as the impeachment process is progressing ,  players should be listening for the various chugging rules .
 when a rule is violated ,  each player must take a sip from their respective beverage .
 don &apos;t rush this ,  honestly - be smart .
 when someone says  &apos;quid pro quo &apos; ,  raise your drink and salute ,  then chug .
 when someone calls the whistleblower a liar/traitor ,  make a pirate arrrgh and sip .
 when anyone uses a whataboutism ,  stand up ,  spin around 360 ,  and consume .
 if anyone mentions  &apos;fake news &apos; ,  smack your forehead and say  &apos;duh &apos; ,  then imbibe .
 if anyone mentions giuliani ,  take the little green man off your glass ,  then take a glug .
 put your thumb on the table anytime someone says  &apos;witch hunt: ,  and the last person to do so takes one .
 whenever pelosi is mentioned ,  the first person to  &apos;pelosi clap &apos; can give a drink to another player .
 if someone says  &apos;trump has done nothing illegal &apos; ,  everyone make a siren sound and guzzel
 shot every time the narrative changes between  &apos;there was no quid pro quo &apos; and  &apos;there was quid pro quo but that &apos;s fine .
 every time someone refuses to answer a direct question ( whether through dancing around it or saying they can’t recall ,  or can’t answer etc ) chug for 3 seconds .
 hopefully this helps you get through one person without dying for alcohol poisoning  .
 every time someone says trump - take a shot
 just drink constantly .
  don &apos;t stop drinking until this whole goddamn thing is over and we can get back to the real reality we split off from in 2012 .
 promise to give up drinking if trump gets impeached .
 1 drink: every time the same trump or biden is mentioned .
 2 drinks: every time ukraine is mentioned .
 3 drinks: every time “impeach” or “impeachment” is said  .
 finish your drink: every time someone takes one of those awkward gulps of water
 please don &apos;t do this .
 you &apos;ll all die of alcohol poisoning no matter what the rules are .
 nice try ,  funeral companies
 every time you want the world to end drink a bottle of whiskey
 watch it with someone from the other side of the fence ,  and each of you drinks every time the other says something you think is obviously dumb .
 you &apos;ll both be hammered in minutes .
 we all just tweet  &apos;sad &apos; after we finish a bottle
 how about every time a congressman (or woman) asks a question and then interrupts the person trying to answer it ,  we hit ourselves in the side of the head with a hammer ?
 i drank beer ,  i still drink beer .
 do you like beer ,  senator ?
 the past three years has already done enough damage to my liver - i &apos;m going to put together impeachment bingo cards instead .
 i assume that every rule-set degenerates to ,   &apos;drink non-stop until drinking more is no longer possible .
  &apos; whether that is because you have run out of digestive space ,  are too drunk to successfully consume additional liquor ,  or are dead will depend on the individual .
 drink every time you hear  &apos;clinton &apos;
 take a drink everytime someone answers a question with  &apos;i don &apos;t remember .
 shot of tequila for president  .
 shot of vodka for trump
  &apos;the american people .
 but i want to drink ,  not sit there sober like some kind of loser .
 i wanted to get shitfaced not stay sober
 people will die of thirst first
 wanna make it water while you &apos;re at it ?
 raise your drink for people citing this core american value !
 2 shots if a republican says it
 1/2 shot for  &apos;political witchhunt !
 finish your drink for  &apos; .
 except the president &apos;
 you could also pass a coach-style whistle around and take a shot every time someone says “whistleblower”
 this one is very good .
 holy shit this is incredible .
  &apos;well we did do the nose .
 but she is a witch !
 on that theme ,  cut out a small paper witch hat ,  stick it on the screen and when ever someone is  &apos;wearing &apos; it on tv ,  take a drink .
 i can &apos;t believe you actually made it fun .
 do they introduce new people very often during these proceedings ?
 seems like that wouldn &apos;t happen often enough .
  how about this modification:  hat changes every time the committee member asking the question changes .
 or is that what is meant by introducing a new person ?
 they rotate questions every few minutes so that should keep things moving .
 you could also combine it with one of the other suggestions like the hat rotates every time someone says quid pro quo or i can &apos;t recall .
 otherwise this is a fantastic idea .
 just need to keep that hat moving
 this is a much more realistic drinking game ,  plus it requires attention and critical thinking .
  so there &apos;s a pretty strong negative feedback component .
 every time a witness suddenly realizes “oh no ,  i shouldn’t have said that .
 is rudy giuliani going to be invited ?
 i need to know how many dozens of bottles to buy
 i like this one .
 it actually seems fun .
 this is the kind of ingenuity we need right now .
 thanks for my first award kind stranger !
 omg i &apos;m doing this one .
 i have found my hilarity to get through this madness !
 is this some reference i dont understand ?
 i forgot about this game !
 we used to post-it facial features to the tv and drink when they would line up .
 i &apos;m curious what the joke about mcconnell &apos;s mouth is
 maybe a game already but my brother told me one .
 so put a sticky note mustache at random positions on the screen ,  when a face lines up to the mustache you drink ,  happens more often than you think and always ends badly
 i expect to see a buzzfeed impeachment drinking game article with at least 10 of the top 15 comments by tomorrow
 in google translate voice .
 dear reddit what are your ----- game ideas for the upcoming hearings .
 copyright free cheery music starts .
 take a witch &apos;s hat you .
 the grime off the arse of the slimiest fish in all the waters
 they just steal everything from reddit .
 “i do not recall  .
 this reminds me of the 2016 debates where the candidates would listen to someone ask a question before they talked about whatever they want
 this is actually a pretty good one .
 i like it because it helps train your brain to notice when someone is avoiding ,  diverting ,  etc .
 that &apos;s every time !
 probably safer to drink when a question is actually answered .
 that &apos;s just cruel ,  the liver isn &apos;t evil and you don &apos;t need to punish it like that .
 you won &apos;t have to worry about alcohol poisoning .
  you &apos;ll puke way before that .
 you &apos;re going to pass judgement on peach schnapps and not jaegermeister ?
 orange juice and peach schnapps is my favorite
 i wasn &apos;t drinking last night .
  not only did i not drink ,  but the entire time i was getting drunk i was doing it for the benefit of the country .
  it was well within my rights to drink last night ,  and i did it appropriately ,  and had a designated driver ,  and only vomited in the toilet .
  all reports that i was drinking last night are fake news .
  i have never had a sip of alcohol in my life .
  nobody has a better alcohol tolerance than me; i am a practiced and competent drinker ,  and had a perfect drink last night .
 (also i slept with your sister .
 at this point the game should be  &apos;stop drinking if- &apos; because far more time will be dedicated to doing all the things mentioned in this thread than not doing them
 this guy trumps .
 drink whenever you want .
 claim that you &apos;ve never consumed alcohol .
 claim that you have consumed alcohol ,  but not on the night in question .
 claim that you did drink on the night in question ,  but not to the extent of committing the crime that you &apos;ve been accused of committing while drunk .
 admit to the crime ,  but claim it &apos;s not a crime .
 admit that it &apos;s a crime ,  but claim that it &apos;s not impeachable .
 admit that it &apos;s normally impeachable ,  but is fine for the sake of avoiding socialism .
 drink to forget
 what &apos;s to dodge ?
 just deny you were drinking .
 making up your own reality seems to be on the table these days .
 fuck man ,  that used to be my daily rules .
 holy shit ,  you all have been the nicest ,  most supportive people !
 i appreciate every single one of you for that .
 i &apos;ll give a general answer to a lot of questions then respond to everybody individually .
 yes ,  i &apos;m doing a lot better .
 i do still drink ,  but a lot less than i used to .
 now ,  a 12 pack would take me a couple of days .
 used to be a couple of hours .
 once again ,  please be safe with alcohol .
 just because it &apos;s legal doesn &apos;t always make it a good decision .
 if someone you care about is an alcoholic ,  try to reach out to them .
 sometimes we don &apos;t realize how bad we are until the people we love most desert us ,  which usually leads to an even worse cycle of abuse .
 if you are an alcoholic and want to stop or at least slow down ,  my best advice is to find someone else who is and also wants to improve themselves .
 actively listen to them when they share their feelings ,  and expect the same from them when you share yours .
 it &apos;s not easy ,  but who ever said that improving your life was ?
 aa can work for some ,  group settings can work for some ,  other options can work for some .
 find what works best for you .
 i did several times .
 i &apos;m still not fully sober .
 but that first step and commitment to it is the most important part .
 alright ,  i &apos;ll step down off of my soap box and leave you all with the quote that &apos;s kept me going most: .
  &apos;why do we fall ?
 so that we can learn to pick ourselves up .
 why would you want to experience russian life ?
 check out the machine over here .
 i think it’s more ukraine this time ,  but with your rules more people would survive .
 you have a heart of gold my friend .
 if only you guys had free healthcare  .
 went away a few days and his blew up !
 thanks for the awards !
 also ,  just to clear it up ,  i &apos;m not canadian !
 just a friendly european .
 optimistic ,  assuming they survive .
 bigbird has entered the impeachment hearings .
 nah fam they funded and supported by viewers like me .
 so don &apos;t stop to breathe ?
 someone bout to be haunted by mr .
 chug chug chug chug
 you know donny is gonna yell  &apos;pbs ,  my taxes  pay your salary !
  &apos; and then accuse cnn of being state media .
 ah the lucky ones
 costco vodka is pretty good and is $15 for a 1 .
 in case you were wondering .
 for every 5 people that die you drink
 it needs to be taken seriously ,  people should be sober so make the game everyone takes a shot when a republican asks a question in good faith intending to get to the bottom of the issue and listens to the answer and asks informed follow up questions .
 what &apos;s a squid go-pro ?
 jesus ,  i think you might be culpable for murder for that suggestion lol
 but when they say no quid pro quo you have to shot gun a beer and if you mix the two up you have to have a penalty .
 1 shot each for quid ,  pro ,  quo
 say quid pro quo ten times fast .
 can we stop callign it  &apos;quid pro quo &apos; ?
 lets call it what it is: extortion .
 take a shot every time a talking head makes a quid pro quo pun might be slightly safer .
 finish your drink if someone calls out gym jordan for turning a blind eye to the sexual assault of students
 it takes me a while to metabolize alcohol ,  as i am a human being ,  and i have a rugby-trained liver ,  but this still sounds like i’m getting a ride in the wee-woo-wagon inside of an hour and a half .
 of vodka ,  obviously .
 thanks for the warning ,  i &apos;m deathly allergic to text-based files of 100 or more mb .
 all through the emotional fallacies i was feeling okay about this game .
 then i hit ad hominem and strawman ,  so many strawmen .
 and then the entirety of the logical fallacy section .
 like someone said above ,  just tilt the bottle back when someone starts speaking and don &apos;t stop until they do .
 repeat when next person opens their mouth .
 there isn’t enough alcohol in the world .
 i &apos;m just gonna warn my liver
 i &apos;ve never felt so seen in a comment section .
 everyone better get wasted .
 it &apos;s weird to see covfefe spelled wrong and feel the need to correct it .
 what a crazy world we live in .
 this drinking game is funny yet survivable so sure .
 these are legal proceedings ,  don &apos;t expect a lot of buzz words .
 you may hear which hunt once from the defense but this will be matter of fact and most of this does not pertain to what the inquiry is about
 honestly ,  trump is probably the only us president who could get away with saying  &apos; &apos;shit &apos; or  &apos;fuck &apos; on live tv .
 this one &apos;s fun and sensible ,  will give it a shot .
 2) a democrat says the process is a waste of time .
 that &apos;s not fair .
 tulsi gabbard is technically a democrat .
 you trying to get people killed ?
 the senate at least will not be allowed to have their phones in the chamber .
 donald trump withheld military aid that had been guaranteed to ukraine ,  one of our international allies .
 he told the ukrainian president the aid would come if he agreed to publically announce that he was investigating the bidens and the previous ukranian administration &apos;s  &apos;attempts to collude with the dnc and attack the 2016 election .
  &apos; that last bit is a conspiracy theory floated by paul manafort back in 2016 before the election that for some reason the dnc colluded with ukraine to hack and release their own emails .
 a foreign intelligence official in the white house heard about all this and was concerned and filed a whistleblower complaint .
 that complaint got held up and congress was not notified ,  which legally they should have been .
 the whistleblower then reached out to congress to ask  &apos;hey ,  i filed a complaint and it should have been given to you by now .
 do you know about this ?
  &apos; congress did not know ,  as the complaint was being held up by white house officials installed by trump .
 once news gets out that there is a complaint ,  trump tries to get ahead of the story and released a memorandum of the phone call to prove  &apos;there is no quid pro quo ,  there is nothing wrong with this phone call .
 when you read that memo ,  it becomes clear there in fact is something wrong .
 by all appearances ,  the president of the united states was extorting a foreign government for personal gain and political advantage .
 he was trying to get ukraine to manufacture a scandal that would damage one of his leading political rivals .
 that prompted the democrats in the house to investigate just how deep this abuse of power goes pursuant to impeachment .
 trump later went on live television and told china to investigate the bidens .
 the president told a foreign adversary they should investigate an american citizen ,  which would happen to benefit him politically .
 seems like there is a pattern at this point .
 you dont want to get alcohol poisoning too soon
 added to live tweet rule: every time he rts a white nationalist/maga supporter in support of him during next week .
 “there was no quid pro quo ,  but if there was it’s fine .
 “there was a quid pro quo ,  but it’s just how things are done so it’s fine .
 “it was just a little light extortion ,  do you know what a ny city mob boss would do ?
 trump is basically a mob boss ,  but it’s not like he’s laundering money ,  racketeering ,  enriching his family unethically ,  or committing treason ,  it’s fine guys .
 but that &apos;s the one where the world ended
 it won’t pass the republican senate .
 which is a fantastic reason to keep drinking .
 you would die in 15 minutes
 never has a worse punishment existed .
 drink everclear ,  it has the same effect
 i &apos;m sure the proceedings will still give you ample reason to drink
 then include when someone contradicts something else they said under oath .
 do a shot when someone answers a  different question to the one they were asked .
 doesn &apos;t count if they don &apos;t actually answer a question .
 a glass of champagne if they say it .
 the anonymous whistleblower gets to point at somebody and rat them out .
  that person drinks but then they get to choose the new whistleblower (everyone closes their eyes for 5 seconds and somebody gets a tap on the shoulder)
 birth of something incredible and here to witness the manifestation
 and whenever someone says “i don’t know .
 ” “i don’t recall .
 ”  everyone takes a shot !
 if you hear “that’s not in my purview .
 ” everyone has to shotgun a beer .
 she turned me into a newt !
 and what else floats in water ?
 i don’t think a drinking game that requires attention and thinking is something i can keep up with .
 this is how we save americas soul .
 if you like this get a bunch of fake mustaches ,  hats ,  glasses and then tape them to the tv and if a person lines up with one you drink bust if your friends play and each one has there own item
 turtles apparently like cherry tomatoes .
 he looks an awful lot like a turtle .
 hes a turtle tho !
 off topic ,  but this is the 4th time i’ve seen your username in the comments of several different subreddits in the span of at least a week and it’s a hilarious coincidence .
 i hope you’re having a good day cockdaddykaren
 man i felt so special when i made it into a buzzfeed article about throwing gang signs at my dog .
 felt like a micro accomplishment .
 yup ,  that &apos;s the one .
 expect to hear it non stop .
 i can neither confirm nor deny .
 that &apos;s a surefire way to get alcohol poisoning .
 “i’d like to answer your question with a question”
 i do not agree with the premise of your question
  &apos;i &apos;d like to answer in form of a broadway musical .
 at least entertain us while we all succumb to alcohol poisoning .
 that shit drives me fucking crazy .
 they do that because we force them .
 remember when johnson said  &apos;what &apos;s aleppo ?
  &apos; he got blasted for that .
 instead of saying i don &apos;t understand the question they just go off on their own tangent and no one bats an eye .
 the presidential debates .
 a prestigious american event every four years to see whose voters know less about correlation and causation .
 yeah it does ,  for about 5 minutes and then you &apos;d be too wasted to comprehend their speaking .
 you also die of alcohol poisoning before the first witness hands off the mic .
 i don &apos;t know why but i really started noticing this over the past few years .
 maybe it &apos;s because trudeau rarely answers direct questions but i &apos;ve noticed that a lot of people i know personally answer the question they want to answer ,  not the question that was posed to them .
 i see no problem with this .
 i’m upset just having read it .
 my worst hangover ever came after some college night at a frat red wine party ,  which some moron thought was smart to combine with jaeger shots .
 i was puking the entire next day ,  including on my way to and from a meeting with my academic advisor .
 i literally had to get off the bus at not my stop just to puke ,  wait for the next bus and hop back on .
 lol oh college .
 i wouldn’t go back if you paid me .
 while your temples are intensely pounding
 i have a bad experience with peach schnapps .
 i was at my friend’s croatian wedding as a groomsman .
 at the reception they had some tradition that when you greet a guest entering the banquet hall you take a shot of schnapps .
 we had five groomsmen and there were 400 guest and it was all peach goddamned schnapps .
 it was a blast ,  there was an open bar too .
 everyone there was hammered .
 my brother puked in a car ,  i went home wearing the wrong tuxedo without my wallet .
 best wedding ever .
 oh and we clearly couldn’t have had shots with ever guest .
 at some point we were just raising the shot glass while they drank but then a loud croatian uncle would insist on us drinking and you can say no to these guys .
 i have never drunk jaegermeister whilst also being sober enough to remember the taste .
  i don &apos;t think anyone has .
 this made my brain hurt but it is very in character
 you &apos;re going places
 remember to deny drinking when you get a dui ,  and then laugh when your rich russian friends bail you out of jail and make the charges go away .
 everytime he says or does something that \actually proves he &apos;s guilty\ ,  drink .
 i hope you &apos;re doing better now !
 cause i want to be trashed within the first 15 minutes of the hearing .
  &apos;fuck that bitch ,  this is russia !
 tonight you party with us .
 even in discussing ukraine russia is going to come up .
 the whole reason the ukrainians wanted military aid was to defend themselves against the russians .
 they absolutely could ,  they just seem determined to always vote against it for some insane reason  .
 wow the vitriol from the people who don &apos;t understand how free healthcare works .
 it &apos;s okay ,  i &apos;ll go and get my feelings checked on monday .
 edit 2: gold and silver ?
 looks like several people had money left over from not having to pay for expensive healthcare bills !
  that was just cold .
 who needs healthcare when we’ve been playing at war in the middle east for 20 years ?
 looks like you watched pbs kids as well .
 my favourite was dragon tales
  monthly contributor checking in !
 we give $5/mo and it &apos;s worth every dime - they actually have quality young adult educational stuff that we get full ,  on-demand ,  digital access to on our roku .
 our youngest &apos;s favorite is ,   &apos;crash course ,  &apos; which quickly covers advanced concepts suck balls such as radial forces and also quickly touch on the mathematical equations used to explain such .

 a few days after the 2016 election i was looking at the obituary page in my local newspaper ,  and thought how lucky those people were that they would never have to experience a trump presidency .
  or even know that he had been elected .
 they &apos;re selling 13% eggnog for like ,  8 bucks a bottle
 yeah ,  it &apos;s really a lot better than pretty good .
 that is one of the best kept secrets .
 it &apos;s made the exact same way as top shelf vodka like to the t .
 people prefer it in blind taste tests .
 5 l (that &apos;s 2 normal sized bottles for all you non alcoholics) makes it literally one of the cheapest vodkas on the market .
 gotta have that costco membership though .
 the deaths will just snowball
 i believe the hearings will be conducted by legal council on the committee .
 it won &apos;t be the 5 minute rule (not the whole time at least) it will be lawyers from each party asking questions .
 dude ,  the point of a drinking game is to get drunk .
 with your rules you don’t even need alcohol .
 it’s how you save replays in splatoon
 slowly raises hand
 it allows you to draw 2 new ca .
 as they reportedly explained to trump ,  it means  &apos;quit ,  bro .
  moron ,  it &apos;s called a go pro .
  and we don &apos;t use quid in this country ,  we use america bucks .
 $35 on negligent manslaughter !
 i &apos;d seriously die .
 how to get alcohol poisoning in 10 minutes .
 i can &apos;t even say it ten times fast in my head .
 ahh ,  waterfall rules
 don’t you mean the reverse cash cab ,  where you lose insane amounts of money ?
 how is this the first time i &apos;ve heard  &apos;wee-woo-wagon &apos; .
 damn i need to get out more .
 moscow mules for any mitch mcconnell mentions ?
 extra hard: warn your liver by drinking one for every pissed republican under this question
 petition to give people who misspell covfefe a covfe fee
 for real ,  this is one of the only ones so far that don &apos;t end in sure death .
 this is theater .
 we &apos;ve already seen in these chambers: .
 a) the chairman imitating the godfather imitating trump .
 b) a congresswoman dressed as batgirl .
 c) a ceramic chicken being deposed .
 don &apos;t be surprised if a republican dresses up like a salem witch or a democrat shows up in a babushka
 haha ,  you better hope none of the dems/repubs have a change of heart on this !
 we were better off !
 yeah ,  that would be the deadliest drinking game in history ,  second only to the baseketball one: take a drink every time someone says dude .
 just letting you know that we have matching usernames
 somebody is going to die from alcohol poisoning .
  &apos;i now recall that .
 this is the heads up ,  seven up that adults play .
  a lot darker and it involves alcohol .
  and an impeachment .
 this is fucking brilliant .
 a legendary start to something great going on here ,  boys !
 that &apos;s guaranteed to kill a few people
 there isn &apos;t enough booze in the county
 that &apos;s the point .
 the best drinking games are fundamentally self-limiting ,  so you get good and liquored without feeling duty bound to push yourself into alcohol poisoning .
 when you &apos;re too drunk to think critically about the thing you &apos;re watching ,  you &apos;re drunk enough to just enjoy the spectacle without distraction .
 it is drinking to joy .
 i &apos;m not saying i believe in lizard people but if one day mcconnell gets outed as some sort of reptilian hybrid ,  i &apos;d be like ok ,  makes sense
 i’m so glad that guy eventually held it for him
 oh ny god he does !
 i &apos;m so glad that the human helped the tortoise eat the tomato .
 i was about to be pissed off .
 so use lettuce instead
 and don &apos;t forget the folks of facebook sharing that new drinking game list they found .
 4 weeks from now .
 well ,  wait until your dog shoots you for being apart of a rival gang .
 do you speak latin ?
 if a candidate doesn &apos;t answer a question they should lose time to answer the next question so their opponents have an advantage .
 also i watched some of the analysis after the democratic debates this year .
 people that directly answered questions got slammed .
  &apos;a candidate needs to be strong and force their response to be about the issues they care about .
  &apos; like why the hell even host a debate then if you don &apos;t want them to actually answer the questions you ask .
 to be fair if you &apos;re running for president you should know the answer to that .
 to be fairer still ,  it &apos;s still a better answer than making something up so that you sound like you know what you &apos;re talking about .
 that &apos;s what trump does all the time .
 do you like beer ?
 do shots of beer .
 that &apos;s rule one of politics .
 i &apos;ve never noticed an increase or decrease in that behavior .
 and then i look like a harping asshole because i keep drawing them back toward the points i want them to directly address when they divert or get distracted 
 reporter:  &apos;do you think that murdering babies and grinding them into sausages is bad ?
 this is a simple yes or no answer .
 politician: rambling incoherent talking point vomit with neither  &apos;yes &apos; or  &apos;no &apos; present
 fair enough i &apos;ll get the whiskey
 ive got flash backs to the last time i had peach schnappes .
 needless to say ,  grandad was not impressed with my drunkeness .
 it was my first drink .
 my high school boyfriend loved it ,  and so obviously i had to pretend like it didn’t bother me so he would continue to like me .
 then just drink every time the camera pans across an empty seat .
 bold of to think it &apos;ll take 15 .
  &apos;im the machine and i like to work with cats &apos;
  &apos;it will never work ,  &apos; says us to the dozens upon dozens of other countries where it does work
 i &apos;ve found that many americans are anti-medicare for all until a loved one needs medical care that basically devastates their way of life due to the financial burden .
 i &apos;m literally doing a huge research paper on this .
 basically ,  it comes down to the expenses .
 because the us doesn &apos;t have universal ,  medical providers have no limit on what they charge for services .
 also ,  administrative costs are stupid high .
 if money grubbing wasn &apos;t our system of government ,  it would be entirely possible .
 oh no ,  we don &apos;t vote .
 the men in big suits do
 as an american i can happily say trolling americans about free health care is fucking awesome and you should never stop
 lol the second edit got me
 we have prime time christian talk radio shows calling universal healthcare ungodly socialism .
 “why should i pay for some welfare abusers healthcare from my hard earned paycheck ?
 “last time i got sick nobody paid my bill .
 i had to work hard for it .
 literally all they got when questioned why we shouldn’t have anything nice .
 also they’re afraid every doctor will just up and move to some other country or stop being a doctor because they’ll all be poor under a universal system .
 because people don’t really understand how it works and/or are convinced by right-wing news sources that it will destroy us all .
 dragon tales ,  dragon tales .
 it &apos;s almost time for dragon tales
 zaboomafoo was dope too
 dragon tales and cyberchase were the shit
 magic school bus was my favorite
 instead of telethons ,  pbs should just make a reddit post that has a donation link and they remind everyone that reading rainbow aired on pbs .
 this site has such a boner for that show that they will easily meet their funding goal .
 that plus george shrinks and wishbone
 dude ,  no ,  cyberchase was where it &apos;s at !
 that shit taught me all kinds of cool math shit that let me flex on everyone in 1st grade !
 dragon tales ,  dragon tales
 i was a more of a zoom man myself .
  i learned a lot of things from that show .
 like the zip code for boston ,  massachusetts that a canadian could use to as an address when signing up for things online .
 cyberchase was objectively better
 i wish ,  i wish with all my heart .
  to fly with dragons in a land apart .
 it is liberty &apos;s kids ,  zoom or nothing .
 i’m guessing it was an auto correct ,  but what did you mean to say ?
 you certainly caught my attention .
 i mean ,  crash course &apos;s free on youtube ,  where it started .
 crash course is supported by pbs now ,  but it’s roots will always be on youtube .
 youtube has definitely become the new hub of educational content .
 there’s some pretty high production quality stuff on there ,  and it’s stuff that pbs certainly wouldn’t be able to whip up on their own .
 my mom died the day he was inaugurated .
   the day before was her 80th birthday ,  and i can only imagine her looking at the newspaper and having that stroke .
 she was horrified that our president elect goes around and grabs fannies ,  or as best i can figure ,  the newspaper said p\\\\ ,  and she thought that meant phanny .
  bless her sweet ,  sweet soul .
 i’m a physician and a patient woke up after being sedated for a few days after surgery and i had to break the news about who got elected .
 they were s h o c k e d
 i need to go to costco
 huh ,  never in my life have i seen eggnog sold with alcohol in it .
 only ever heard of people mixing them after the fact .
 i thought it &apos;s how they film sponge bob .
 i’ll be your skid row bro
 idk if you are being sarcastic or not but quid pro quo is latin and means  &apos;this for that &apos; .
 it &apos;s used when describing an interaction where something valuable (like congressionally approved funding for military aid) is promised but only in exchange for something else (like publicly announcing a corruption scandal involving the family of a political rival and the other party &apos;s frontrunner for an election barely a year away) .
 $35 on negligent manslaughter !
 $50 on  &apos;reckless endangerment &apos;  \_
 i’d say murder in the 2nd degree .
 reasonable person would think that’s encouraging someone to die in a gross and negligent manner .
 wasn &apos;t he witholding the money until he gets his way ,  though ?
 no because he was withholding something they where already promised .
 he seems european cause he mentioned rugby .
 so probably not a reverse cash cab .
 that &apos;s a great nickname
 i think they gotta take a shot at least
 like jokes aside ,  one or two of these things will likely  happen but not all of them .
 everyone else’s games read like more checklists .
 b) a congresswoman dressed as batgirl .
 please tell me you have a link for this because that &apos;s hilarious
 or the jaystation one .
 drink anytime he says guys .
 well played ,  good sir .
 god ,  i love america .
 and who are you that is so wise in the ways of science ?
 my dude ,  this is the best philosophy of drinking games i &apos;ve ever seen .
 smart people are the best to get drunk with anyway .
 my bet would be on zuckerberg being a reptilian .
 reptiles have spines ,  so i &apos;m afraid he doesn &apos;t fit the description .
 shout out to my brother who will tell me about this thread 5 days after that
 your honor ,  i was playing the pbs drinking game from reddit ,  none of us remember anything ,  remember guys ?
 bottoms up whenever someone says  &apos;fake news !
 i &apos;ve said for almost a decade--a basketball buzzer .
 at the end of their time ,  basketball buzzer sounds until they shut the fuck up .
 no ,   &apos;well ,  senator .
 senator ,  we really need to get to .
 the moderator just has a button on the desk that sounds off the buzzer ,  and when the person speaking goes over their time the moderator simply presses that button and doesn &apos;t let go of it until the person speaking stops fucking talking .
 reminds me of a bumper sticker i saw on the way home today: “elect a clown ,  expect a circus”
 they should have shock collars .
 and if they refuse ,  their name is taken off the ballot .
 should have a debate where the moderator doesn &apos;t ask any questions ,  just declare a topic and let the candidates have at it .
 the mod will set the topic ,   &apos;enforce &apos; the time limits ,  and epstein didn &apos;t kill himself .
 it &apos;s just a popularity contest and they try to hit the most buzzwords possible .
 most voters don &apos;t even care what they say ,  just vote for who the party says .
 shots of beer instead of liquor might be the only way to survive it .
 have you posted directions on how to make black tar heroin in a previous askreddit post  ?
 i have you tagged as  &apos;black tar instructor &apos; for some reason .
 you were just meant to be an investigative journalist .
 i love it when the reporter repeatedly calls them out on it and keeps asking .
 very rarely do they end up getting an actual answer but at least they make sure the audience knows what &apos;s happening rather than just letting them dodge it .
 and this is different from the past 3 years how ?
 or just drink every time you’re not drinking .
 ”and i fuck cats”  :(
  &apos;it just costs that much for the best healthcare in the world &apos;  .
 my shitty co-workers
 but that won &apos;t make us any money .
 my dad doesn &apos;t seem to grasp that if he got cancer it would destroy his life financially .
  doesn &apos;t care ,  doesn &apos;t think it &apos;ll happen to him .
 i used to know/work with/be friends with a bunch of ex-convicts .
  they used to say ,  a republican is just a democrat who hasn &apos;t gone to jail yet .
  it &apos;s amazing how quickly you discover that ethics are good things when the same kind of good  &apos;ol boy who used to drink with you at the bar is now strip-searching you because he &apos;s bored .
  you go from hating undesirables to becoming an undesirable ,  and you realize how wrong you &apos;ve been .
 except the providers don’t get the money ,  the insurance companies do .
 source: my wife is a health care professional .
 she just got out of network because she was tired of the insurance companies settling her rates and then not paying fuck all .
 corporations are people ,  my friend .
 acts 2:44-45 english standard version (esv) .
 44 and all who believed were together and had all things in common .
 45 and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all ,  as any had need .
 early christians were all about that social welfare .
 modern christians don &apos;t emulate a single goddamned christ-like behavior .
 what do they say when you explain them how a private insurance pool works ?
 hey what a wonderful kind of day
 come along take my hand ,  let &apos;s all go to dragon laaaaaaaaaand
 fuck i miss dragon tales .
 that was such a feel good show .
 you &apos;ve just reminded me of the name of a show i &apos;ve been trying to find for a decade .
 let the reminiscing commence .
 i was leap ,  leap ,  leaping along .
 zaboomafoo(with the kratt brothers !
 cyberchase was low key high quality tv .
 they managed to do long storylines on an episodic format .
 i don &apos;t think any other cartoons did that untill adventure time and regular show .
 cyber chase we’re moving we’re beating hacker at his game
 i loved cyberchase dispite the fact that i &apos;m terrible at math
 i miss wishbone so damn much .
 and it was autocorrect2 .
 evidently ,  it thought i swiped ,   &apos;suck ,  &apos; and automatically put ,   &apos;balls ,  &apos; when i tried to swipe ,   &apos;as .
 i should probably reflect on the fact that my phone automatically goes that way to anticipate my thoughts .
 i went under anesthesia just before he was inaugurated and came out after .
 the only way to travel .
 there was some guy kidnapped by the taliban .
  he said when they told him he thought they were joking
 psychologist and i now do forensic stuff ,  but my friends who work in ers and similar were telling me they’ve stopped asking “who is the president ?
 ” to check for orientation ,  because it upsets people ,  but one was saying they like to ask it with older immigrant folks ,  especially those using an interpreter ,  because many don’t know his name but will describe him and it’s funny to hear descriptions like “the screaming guy who doesn’t comb his hair” or “the guy with all the wives and the pornography friends who didn’t actually beat the blonde lawyer woman .
 still don &apos;t believe it .
 this is some incredible morphine
 my polisci professor walked into the classroom the day after the election and told us that he didn &apos;t have a lecture prepared that day- the one he made was about why trump lost
 sir ,  you &apos;ve been in a coma for the past forty-eight hours .
 my grandfather was under for heart surgery the day of the election .
 he woke up a day later and the first thing he asked my grandmother was  &apos;who won ?
  &apos; he apparently just closed his eyes and went back to sleep without saying a word after he heard the news .
 not the news he was hoping to hear .
  &apos;it &apos;s ok pro ,  you go when you feel like it .
 gosh i love that movie .
 i was poor growing up and that’s the only dvd we had .
 i literally watched it everyday for a couple years .
 it holds a special place in my heart even though a lot of people don’t like it .
 since then i’ve watch 1 and 2 and they’re just as great !
 $100 on suicide by homicidal strangulation
 we have rugby in the us .
 but jacque cousteau could never get this low .
 i feel oddly british about it .
 i am arthur ,  king of the britain
 his eyes are too lifeless .
 same but it’s my boyfriend so i have to smile and pretend i haven’t seen it yet .
 i do not recall .
 or just mute their mic
 i like how this is also a joke about how common the viewpoint is that the current debate format sucks .
 there &apos;s so much wrong with modern-day democracy ,  but even now that some americans are more active in politics it seems hard to make a dent in the overall process .
 the main thing to remember is to keep going and that michael bloomberg is in epstein &apos;s black book of customers .
 fuck that let &apos;s divvy them up into dodgeball teams .
 look at my calendars
 instructions unclear ,  filled pint glass with grain alcohol .
 it makes great interviews ,  but it also means that reporter is unlikely to get another interview with that person .
 one thing i &apos;d love to see but never have is the journalist asking  &apos;can you repeat the question i just asked back to me ?
  &apos; at the end of a ramble that has nothing to do with the question whatsoever .
 not sure how well it &apos;d go over ,  but it &apos;d be so satisfying to watch .
 you didn’t die of alcohol poisoning the past three years .
 i see you like to live dangerously .
 which none of them receive ,  because that best healthcare is only for the elites .
  &apos;we have the best insulin .
 i cant afford it ,  but we have it .
 my dad got cancer he was dead within 5 months .
 he made 200k a year for 15 years .
 we had what s considered “great” insurance .
 drained 800k worth of savings .
 if my dad didn’t pay into substantial life insurance my disabled mom would be homeless .
 that &apos;s how it is with everyone ,  the  &apos;i &apos;m alright jack &apos; mentality .
 until they &apos;re not and they bitch that they &apos;re fucked
 that &apos;s one of my biggest points i &apos;m making in my paper !
 i &apos;m doing direct comparisons to canada numbers .
 idk currently ,  but as of about 5 years ago ,  our cost per capita is at least 5 times that of canada .
 people bitch about  &apos;wait times &apos; on medical care .
 i found that something like 18 , 000 americans die each year because they can &apos;t afford medical care .
 on outcomes ,  the us isn’t the worst though .
 they’re top ten in most cancer and cardio vascular treatments .
 japan and south korea appear to be consistently higher though .
  &apos;i &apos;ll believe corporations are people when the great state of texas executes one &apos; .
 - random bumper sticker i saw
 the law says corporations are people ,  and psychology says those people are psychopaths .
 something something free market
 where we can learn to work and play
 i wish ,  i wish ,  .
 with all my heart ,  .
 to fly with dragons !
 in a land apart .
 some stuff just sticks with you .
 avatar the last airbender did it ,  where every episode was separated enough to be its own thing ,  but still had a bearing on the overarching plot .
 like kotara &apos;s of learning bloodbending was basically a horror episode focused solely on that ,  but still had a meaningful way of developing characters and their abilities
 my favorite part is that it taught me mathematical insight instead of just teaching how to do math .
 there was an episode that revolved around the fact that you can increase the total length of a parallelogram by changing the angles ,  or another where they taught that you can change a shape &apos;s area while keeping the perimeter the same ,  or changing the speed of a gear train by changing the gears &apos; size .
 that’s the hacker ,  to you !
 its past my bedtime when a simple autocorrect can make me almost piss my pants
 that &apos;s fucking hilarious
 is it possible to be anaesthetised for say ,  four or five years ?
 is this a service that can be bought ?
 seriously ,  with the uk taking a shit with its clothes on and the us doing much of the same i’d be quite happy to skip the next few years .
 it must be mind-blowing to kids that trump was a reality tv star .
 they still asked it when my dad was in the hospital in 2018 .
 he had some understandable disorientation so when they asked him who the president was at first he said reagan (his favorite president) and then he stopped himself ,  said that &apos;s not right ,  thought about it but apparently couldn &apos;t remember trump &apos;s name so he just said  &apos;the orange guy .
  &apos; got the point across ,  lol .
 my mom is 76 and was experiencing an altered mental status due to an infection .
 she had fallen ,  and was not acting right ,  and we were trying to get her to go to the hospital via ambulance ,  but she was resisting ,  and we didn’t have power of attorney .
 the emt was assessing orientation and asked if she knew the year - “2019 .
 ” did she know what day it was ?
 ” did she know who the president was ?
 ”  there were about six people in the room ,  and nobody could stop snickering for about five minutes .
 we still asked it at our hospital .
 one elderly patient couldn &apos;t quite remember but said ,   &apos;that asshole !
  &apos; we accepted that answer .
 i work in a similar setting ,  a client asked me why staff don &apos;t ask that question to check for mental confusion anymore and i said ,   &apos;because we prefer not to think about it &apos; she laughed and understood lol
 when does the euphoria kick in ?
 oh boy i can &apos;t wait to see what clinton did as president
 we do but it &apos;s not one of the more popular ones .
 that &apos;ll be the booze .
 binders full of woman .
 whoops ,  wrong guy .
 he was such a great man .
 keeping these calendars when he was with us .
 dad is sitting right behind him
 looks like i’ve got a 4:30 devil’s triangle scheduled .
 red faced man child tantrum intensifies
 but his calendars .
 you wouldn &apos;t even be able to have that grain without the farmer &apos;s stimulus .
 or worse ,  with any other politicians .
 overall ,  maybe that &apos;s not worse ,  when you consider how much less time they would have to spend with shitty people .
 wtf u scared the shit out of me he &apos;s still alive
 it takes 200-300 rupees for a blood test here .
 converting to dollars: 3-4 dollars .
 that &apos;s where i hope to be different .
 wait time in canada is on non-urgent services ,  and most of the time you won’t hear people complaining because it’s reasonable .
 genuinally curious on this cause my parents always bring it up when i debate health care with them ,  is there actually a significantly longer wait time for universal health care vs those in the us who do have health care ?
 reminder that texas is going to execute an innocent man in 12 days !
 and get along with each other
 we love you too ,  bud
 to use this rhyme  .
 to go back home .
 fuck that &apos;s what got me into d&d tbh .
 fuckin love dragon tales .
 i remember that by heart for some reason ,  that show was the shit .
 how often do you use the word  &apos;hope ?
  &apos; you must be a wonderful person !
  &apos;a shit with its clothes on &apos; r/rareinsults
 star is a very generous term for what he was .
 according to a couple friends who in the last few years completed their education and are in residency ,  they no longer teach that as a question to ask .
  older doctors set in their ways i can guarantee you still ask this question because they &apos;ve done it for 30 years .
 i saw an old guy get asked the president question in hospital during an ekg test .
 he said   &apos;i don &apos;t want to say his name !
  &apos; and then started singing that old song  &apos;when the furher says .
  &apos; then the nurse asked him to relax (for the next part of the test) .
 yeah ,  they need to change that .
 your mom &apos;s the goat .
 hope she &apos;s doing better .
 it might be just that it’s almost 3 am when you connected “booze” and “briticism” in my brain ,  but suddenly i’m wondering if anyone has boiled vodka and made tea with it .
 they have other flavored vodkas so why not earl grey ?
 don &apos;t tell me what to do !
 handsy hank and donkey dong doug enter the chat .
 yeah i know brett kavanaughty by nature ,  squeeee

 nah the npr interviews i &apos;ve heard get to the point and don &apos;t let them dodge unless they basically say they aren &apos;t going to answer .
 mary louise kelly is an artist when it comes to interviews .
 we have 2-3 generations here in the us that are pushing for it heavily .
 it &apos;s really only a matter of time ,  but like many other issues ,  we just keep putting them off until suddenly the oceans full of poison .
 and even then , it &apos;s non-urgent specialist things for the most part ,  or non-urgent specialty testing .
 and averages vary from place to place .
 the average time to wait for the specialist i need in canada is two months ,  compared to four in the us .
 and more specifically ,  if i were to drive straight north and see the first specialist there ,  it &apos;d only be six weeks compared to five months in my city .
 if you &apos;re in rural nowheres and there are no doctors of course you &apos;re waiting unless you drive somewhere ,  but you &apos;d wait anyways .
 no hospital is going to ignore you if you need urgent care ,  the only thing that happens is that things that can be delayed are delayed .
 people complaining about wait times are still alive and able to complain .
 i mean ,  i &apos;m an american and it took me no joke ,  six months to see a gastroenterologist .
 if it &apos;s time sensitive ,  no ,  we &apos;ll get you in asap .
 if your knee hurts because you &apos;re too fat ,  you can &apos;t just walk in and demand surgery next week .
 if you &apos;re in the er cause your kid has tummy troubles you &apos;ll be there a long time cause people with real problems get priority .
 admittedly having people dying at home because they can &apos;t afford to go to the hospital cuts down on the queue by at least 18 , 000 .
 i don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
 for serious things here in canada you get in rather quickly .
 i had a double hernia and was through my doctor within days had an ultrasound a week later and had my surgery completed within two months .
 that &apos;s pretty minor work though it would seem .
 my aunt had surgery for breast cancer and was in for chemotherapy within a few weeks of being diagnosed .
 we need a reddit bot that reminds us of current injustices so we can petition against them or at least know about them .
 you &apos;d love a guy in my current campaign .
 he &apos;s playing a dragonborn barbarian named ord .
 underrated experience honestly
 i don &apos;t remember how old the person who asked was ,  but it could have easily been someone who had been in the field for longer - he stayed awhile and had a huge team so there were people of all ages handling his care .
 who asked is gone from my memory but the moment he tried to answer stuck .
 i remember we laughed about it after and i told him it was trump which he recognized as soon as he heard it .
 y &apos;all don &apos;t care about gang bang greg do ya ?
 this dude has a lifetime appointment on the supreme court .
 it blows my mind .
 especially since the gaff basically boiled down to “old dude fucks up at saying he knows a lot of capable women who would be interested” .
 other than his idiot vp i could have 100% lived with him being the person i was angry at for winning .
 instead we are in todayworld where it’s like a feverdream of insanity
 it took me four just to see a gp in arizona
 i &apos;m more talking about the non life threatening stuff though .
 for example i have something that feels like an ear infection and none of the over the counter stuff is working .
 i know it &apos;s not life threatening and other people have more important problems ,  but would i just have to deal with it for six months or so ?
 right now i don &apos;t want to pay to go to the doctor so i &apos;ve been waiting and hoping it goes away and i &apos;m just curious to know at what point would i get in to see a doctor with something small like this in a country with universal health care
 if it listed injustices alphabetically ,  it would hit the character limit before  &apos;b &apos; .
 we had one but reddit servers couldn &apos;t handle the load .
 then china invested in reddit and the bot was sent to a reeducation camp and now all it does is delete pictures of winnie the pooh .
 you gotta listen to your heart ,   .
 listen to the beat

 aw dip ,  pillboy !
 matt damon is legend .
 getting to see a gynecologist is such a joke .
 even just to walk in ,  have my blood pressure taken ,  confirm i am good with the current prescription ,  and get the renewal signed i &apos;d have to schedule really long in advance .
 ear infections can become quite serious .
 in your case maybe a pharmacist would be able to direct you to something ,  and most family doctor (once you have one appointed ,  and maybe quebec specific) will see you in the next 2-3 weeks ,  maybe faster if the pharmacist have serious doubts .
 here (uk) if you know how to do it ,  you can normally see a gp in two to three days .
 trick is to call your registered clinic right at 8am and ask if they have any free appointments .
 chances are ,  someone will have cancelled theirs and you &apos;ll get to see a gp or duty nurse the same day .

 i &apos;m satisfied now 
 my only question is .

 i find that really unlikely
 i knew someone had to have said this .

  &apos;pope slapped woman &apos; comes across as a pretty big scandal but seeing the video he was justified .
 you don &apos;t treat anyone ,  especially an 83 year old pope ,  that way .
 if you aren &apos;t going to let go be prepared for the consequences .
 i &apos;d have done the same .
 she yanked on his hand .
 pope isn &apos;t exactly a youth .
 that could have injured his hand ,  wrist ,  elbow or shoulder .
 she is lucky one of his body guards didn &apos;t decide to take action instead .
 that shit was completely justified .
 ridiculous he needed to apologize for that .
 that person would just not let go .
 the hell ,  he didn &apos;t  &apos;slap her .
  &apos; what a dumb freakin &apos; title up there .
 yeah she 100% deserved that
 and there will be no day 4

 you should look up “the man from taured .
 ” it’s a urban legend about a man who was at an airport in japan using a passport from a country that has never existed ,  but seemed to be just as normal as any other person .
 he had stamps on the passport from japan like he was a regular business man working in the country .
 he thought he was from a place between france and spain called the kingdom of taured and claimed to work for a company that didn’t exist .
 they didn’t believe him but he was so convincing that it isn’t sure where this man came from .
 then he mysteriously vanished while under surveillance by authorities .
 the strange part is that when they interviewed him he just seemed confused about everything .
 the theory is that he was from a parallel universe .

 shame on the vatican security for not being faster on the draw ,  though .

 it wasn &apos;t even a slap ,  but a smack on the hand .

 he really did not have to apologize .
 he apologized because he holds himself to a high standard and felt that he did not meet said standard .
 i don &apos;t know why i find it so funny that his reaction was so  &apos;normal &apos; .
 being the pope i thought he &apos;d be more pope &apos;y ?
 whatever that is .
 i still haven &apos;t gotten mine :(

 there was people trying to blow the whistle even earlier than this iirc ,  by this point you definitely could have heard of corona and take a shot in the dark that it would be the flavor of the year of the rat .
 first place i heard about it was the  &apos;conspiracy &apos; talk show ground zero .
 i think it was literally weeks before i heard anyone else talk about it and i remember him saying  &apos;remember you heard it here first &apos; and i just sort of rolled my eyes thinking that &apos;d be the last i heard of it .
 i just want to be included here for anyone else that stumbles across this .
 if you find this please say hi .

 /u/blatantconservative wants to say hi too and /u/busean says hello and yikes .
 /u/kennyrodgerschicken also says hi .
 /u/jeffcavaliere-here says hi (march 2021) - also ,  happy 1 year of covid !
 /u/vakve & /u/mrod30-06 are both saying hi ,  and /u/stuffingmybrain & /u/thehealeroftri would also like to say hello .

 1- knowledge of sars ,  didn &apos;t go into a pandemic ,  but it could have if it were more infectious   .

 pimp slapped is so 2019 .
 pope slapped is the  2020 hotness .
 yeah i immediately went to see the video and was surprised because the title of all the articles were clickbait .
 if he hadn &apos;t shrugged himself free the same news sources could report  &apos;woman assaults pope &apos; ,  or  &apos;security fails pope &apos; which i would think would be more justified .
 it must be just as infuriating to be yanked back by someone who forces you to listen to them as it is when your earbuds get yanked out of your ears by the door handle .
 that he only slapped her lightly to indicate that he wasn &apos;t going to go to her is to me an example of his patience !
 yeah it looked like that yank might have hurt his shoulder .
 he wanted her to let go before he got hurt again .
 i wouldn &apos;t even call that a slap .
 someone on the radio said it looked like a grandma slapping a kids hand that &apos;s trying get into the cookie jar
 yeah she could &apos;ve fully stabbed or shot him in that time if her intentions had been different .
 be prepared for the consequences .
 it &apos;s worth mentioning ,  that most people ,  be they pope or some nobody like me ,  might have an involuntary reaction to someone grabbing/hitting them .
 he probably didn &apos;t take the time to think  &apos;i &apos;m going to smack her hand like a naughty five year old &apos; ,  it was just grabsmackohshit i was on camera wasn &apos;t i ?
 had a broken hand years ago .
 was trying to escape this church function where everyone wanted to be super friendly ,  and as i weaved my way through the crowd to the door ,  this younger fella steps in front of me ,  grabs my broken hand ,  and tries to give me a handshake .
 should have been  &apos;asshat yanks pope &apos;
 apparently he broke his wrist a while ago too so that must’ve made it worse
 that video goes on about women being hit ,  abused etc .
 sorry ,  don &apos;t care that it was a woman .
 she grabbed him forcefully and deserved the slap .
 if it was a man ,  same thing imo .
 yea ,  i think this was blown out of proportion .
 he is an old man ,  i &apos;ve seen people a third his age fuck up their neck sneezing .
 having someone unexpectedly yank on you could do more ,  she should know better .
 he isn &apos;t immortal .
 he wasn &apos;t apologizing because there w pressure to do so .
 he apologized because he is the pope and ,  in his eyes ,  any act of violence is shameful ,  no matter how small .
 he wasn &apos;t wrong .
 he just also recognized his own failure to live up to his own standards in that particular situation .
  &apos;i apologize for the bad example set yesterday &apos; .
  &apos;i should have slapped her in her dumb face !

 they stepped down the stairway ,    .

 their faces a mixture   .
 of shock and surprise -   .
  &apos; they whispered ,      .
 and listened ,  and then -   .

 and they took off again .

 strangers are just friends we havent met yet .
 it &apos;s ok ,  this thread isn &apos;t marked serious .
 the reason you may not be seeing much of it on reddit is because megathreads have already been created .
 that &apos;s what i was thinking .
  you can see him wince in pain as he is jerked forward .
  in that moment he was probably all of a sudden hurt and scared of a fall .
  the dudes who are supposed to keep him safe didn &apos;t do so .
 keep in mind the pope used to be a nightclub bouncer in argentina in his earlier days .
 still has some of his aggressive spark in him .
 i’ve also read that he recently had injured that wrist ,  making it even more painful to be suddenly grabbed and jerked like that .
 seeing as how crazy this year is i believe this .
 ah yes ,  the negotiator .
 the pope was greeting people and as he was walking away a woman grabbed his hand and pulled him back really hard and wouldn’t let go .
 in the video he looks like he yells out in pain .
 i don’t blame him for reacting the way he did ,  he’s old and it could have hurt him .
 it would also be pretty scary to have a complete stranger just grab you in a crowd like that .
 wouldn’t let go of the pope’s hand and then got a few popen hand slaps .
 think of trump but with a firm ass .
 ughhh ,  you put it in my head !
 i imagine what he looks like  naked is similar to when a small amount of water is trapped in a tan plastic grocery bag and the bag is all twisted up in a weird shape .
 and we didn &apos;t listen .
 i guess we weren &apos;t ready for that yet .
 but our kids are gonna love it !

 “look ,  the grand canyon is a very beautiful place .
 i loved the sights there .
 but i was bored after a few minutes .
 the only time i wasn’t bored was when i was standing inches from my death .
 there is no fence to stop you from falling thousands of feet to the bottom .

  &apos; then they cut the footage into twenty different 1 second clips that you have to view on seperate pages .
 when your earbuds get yanked out of your ears by the door handle .
 this makes me so incredibly angry and it &apos;s all the worse because there is no one to direct my anger at
 yeah ,  isn &apos;t he 83 years old ?
 you can &apos;t just yank an elderly person around by the arm !
 that might also have been a hand squeeze from her but i guess i can &apos;t know that from the angle .
 no ,  that was definitely a hand squeeze .
 i can &apos;t imagine doing that to an 80 yo grandparent of mine .
 you can see the pain in his face as he turns around .
  she was acting like an obnoxious child too .
 how can she slap ?
 2  that wasn &apos;t abuse towards her ,  that was an acceptable corrective action towards her behavior .
 this is a very wholesome response ,  despite the fact that you shot john lennon .
 i &apos;d like to take this time to apologize .
 to absolutely no one !
 be realistic man ,  tie fighters don &apos;t have hyperdrives
 honest to god ,  never heard of it .
 is it worth watching ?
 my superpower: creating awesome original stories that were made into average tv shows a year earlier .
 we are their alternate ,  insane universe .
 you mean terraria ?
 better watch out before r/foundthemobileuser gets ya .
 its honestly the dumbest subreddit i &apos;ve ever visited .
 maybe not the worst ,  but definitely the dumbest .
 what a double cross .
 i don &apos;t blame him tbf .
 now that would be one hell of a summer blockbuster .
 i imagine it is easier and cheaper to build a piping network from the ground up rather than modifying existing networks ,  or even just laying them down without disrupting daily life .
 especially if the sinking will be so disastrous that 1/3 of the city will be lost in 5 years .
 i wonder if they &apos;ll get away with it ,  or that it will cause major backlash since it is essentially abandoning a sinking city .
 don &apos;t feel bad ,  you &apos;re helping bring attention to it .
 but now it will !
 if it had just ended instead of entering part 2 it would have been such a more powerful book .
 if you haven &apos;t already ,  read cryptonomicon by stephenson .
 its as good as - or better than ,  by my reckoning - the first half of seveneves .
 im on record ,  multiple times ,  saying its the finest american novel of the 21st century .
 not nearly as scifi as seveneves ,  but stephenson proves himself a master of storytelling across its 1000 pages .
 the last part is  !
 such a let down .
 it &apos;s basically  &apos;divergent &apos; in space .
 is this his anime laugh ?
 the moon should &apos;ve dodged
 that &apos;s such a dumb episode .
 french and german folks: ah shit here we go again .
 i recommend a wee little kansas town called jericho .
 when somebody asks you if you &apos;re a god ,  you say yes !
 nobody steps on a church in my town !
 patrolling the mojave dmv almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter .
 after the 3rd world war .
 zefram cochrane later on r/iama: .
 i am the first man to bang an alien .
 huzzah ,  a man of quality !
 there are worse ways to go .
 we &apos;ll bang ,  okay ?
 what is it called
 in english ,  yes trump actually said this !
 “look ,  having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer ,  dr .
 john trump at mit; good genes ,  very good genes ,  ok ,  very smart ,  the wharton school of finance ,  very good ,  very smart — you know ,  if you’re a conservative republican ,  if i were a liberal ,  if ,  like ,  ok ,  if i ran as a liberal democrat ,  they would say i’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true !
 i put this through google translate and what came out is very broken and hard to understand .
 so ,  a very accurate translation of the source material .
 no that’s too pure for 2020 take it back
 the sole purpose of megathreads .

 lol now i imagine the pope just throwing some drunks out of the nightclub
 it &apos;s only been 72 hours
 hold my air-to-surface missile ,  i’m going in !
 especially since there have been many assassination attempts on popes over the centuries ,  jpii being the most famous example in recent years .
 it would be scary enough as an everyday person to be grabbed and pulled by a stranger in a crowd ,  much more if you’re the freaking pope .
 worse than  &apos;not let go &apos; ,  she pulled him back to her as he was walking away
 i now have an inverted erection
 no joke ,  this comment is probably one of the worst things i &apos;ve ever read .
 such a detailed description .
 we didn &apos;t listen !
 being forced to miss school hits a little different
 it &apos;s 27 days later and i &apos;m consistently getting several responses a day .
 where are y &apos;all getting linked from ?
 or are that many of you just browsing through old askreddit threads ?
 “the outdoor bidet had way too much water pressure and it hurt my bum .
 idiot never brought his own beer to the outdoors .
 tell me how i know what kind of person this is
 also ,  olive garden is pretty cheap .
 “whatever you do ,  be warned that there are no barriers around the edges which fall about 300-900 feet into the depths of the canyon .
 do not take pictures or have pictures taken of yourself without being serious .
 do not hover about the canyon whilst drunk .
 this makes me think this review was written by a ghost .
 we need to arrange for this guy to touch lava on youtube .
 “beautiful view from nome .

 despite being called the  &apos;bering strait &apos; ,  i &apos;m still very gay .
 but 10/10 for being gay .
 “neighbors tend to be distant and reclusive .
 friendlier ones only want to eat the kids .
 on the positive side ,  the gingerbread houses are surprisingly warm in the winter time .
 despite being called bering strait i &apos;m still very gay ,  very disappointing 0/0 but 10 / 10 for being gay .
 lol these reviews are crazy .
 ugh ,  who can blame her ,  it &apos;s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere .
 there were 4 reasons .
 it &apos;s so good we skipped a number .
 it &apos;s been a long time and it &apos;s a huge update ,  so we skipped a number .
 it &apos;s sort of a combo of 2 and 3 ,  so add them together .
 no one wanted to see a winamp 4 skin .
 pope-in ain’t easy .
 the pope broke his wrist back in 2009 or sometime around then ,  so it’s possible that it still causes him pain ,  especially if it gets yanked like that
 also you can &apos;t just yank the pope
 most 60-70 year olds would have bad bruising & skin tears from that let alone 80 year old .
 no doubt the injuries are more severe than it appears .
 would it help if i went on fox news and apologized ?
 it was a dark period in my life .
 my sister and i watched the whole first season ,  and season two is soon to come out .
 it was good in the beginning but i &apos;m not sure where they &apos;re going and they don &apos;t seem to know either so i have doubts .
 visually it &apos;s not amazing either (special effects are kinda terrible) but if you like slow burn with ok characters and a lot of build-up without answers than its the show for you .
 it started promising but didnt go anywhere good .
 go watch some good shows instead like the expanse and mr robot .
 i highly suggest everyone to check out  &apos;the expanse &apos; .
 5 on imdb ,  with season 3 and 4 having 100% on rottentomatoes .
 it &apos;s most likely the best sci-fi this decade .
 s1 has a very detective/noir feel to it ,  but later in s2 and onwards ,  it gets more focused on space sci-fi .
 this is like some twilight zone shit .
 get on a plane ,  get off in an alternate (much danker) timeline .
 the thing from terraria that i most wish minecraft had is the verticality .
 compared to the practically infinite horizontal size ,  255 blocks is laughably small .
 makes the world hell incredibly flat .
 yeah but without the rpg class equipment and all the uncraftable stuff ,  and in 3d ,  and with mods .
 which contains a new type of ore ,  that blows up when exposed to an air block .
 they &apos;ll stay waiting until the line gets reconnected .
 that opinion is so popular it should be on r/unpopularopinion .
 i’ve never understood what the purpose of pointing out mobile users is other than showing off capital ‘r’ noticing skills ,  which never really seemed like something anyone was in doubt about .
 humans v aliens v jesus
 when little timmy stared above   .
 to see the starry sky -   .
 he looked with hope and joy and love ,    .
 and sat and breathed a sigh .
  &apos;how sweet it is to see ,  &apos; he said -   .
  &apos;how fair to find a place -   .
 how nice it is to stare ahead   .
 beyond the skies to space .
 and so he sat and smiled and soon ,    .
 he looked with peace and pride .
 a crack appeared across the moon .
 and timmy fucking died .
 what will you do ,  when it starts raining moon poo .
 have you read anathem ?
 even better than cryptonomicon ,  imo .
 a true masterpiece
 you have twenty four hours until the piss droplets hit the fucking earth now get out of my sight before i piss on you too
  &apos;i pissed on your wife ,  eggman .
 she &apos;s mine now .
  &apos;what the actual shit ?
 meh at least maybe we &apos;ll get some new source material for sabaton .
 only 1916 boys remember
 i love her cause she sleeps above her sheets .
 three feet above her sheets .
 currently sitting in the dmv on a 3 .
 5 hour wait ,  can confirm nuclear winter is preferred .
 i would rather sit in a bunker than in the dmv waiting
 wait ,  have we already lived through the eugenics war ?
 or is that just running late ?
 but like here &apos;s the thing ,  would they be attractive to us ?
 like i think about what makes someone attractive to me and like you add spikey ears sure .
 but you mess with skin color ?
 you mess with hair ?
 you mess with aging ?
 like what if young aliens looked like old humans and old aliens looked like young humans ?
 how do you fuck up english this bad
 wow wtf thats some r/ihadastroke shit
 i &apos;m more or less fluent in spanish and i can say that this is an accurate spanish rendition of his  &apos;style of speaking .
 mire ,  teniendo nuclear ,  mi tío fue un gran profesor ,  científico e ingeniero ,  el dr .
 john trump del mit; buenos genes ,  muy buenos genes ,  ok ,  muy inteligente ,  wharton school of finance ,  muy buena ,  muy inteligente ,  ya sabes ,  si eres un republicano conservador ,  si yo fuera un liberal ,  si ,  como ,  ok ,  si me postulara como demócrata liberal ,  dirían que soy una de las personas más inteligentes del mundo ,  ¡es cierto !
 it &apos;s a 100% accurate translation .
 he said all that .
 god damn ,  i tried it too ,  and it &apos;s actually kind of astonishing how well the broken translation captures his voice .
 i need an omegathread for all my megathreads .
 oh dear ,  you don’t typically come back from that .
 so ,  why did he have to apologize ?
 this is bullshit .
 isn &apos;t that fucking yourself or your dick is upside down
 i just went to the subreddit and filtered by top of all time out of curiosity .
 and it was really hot and acidic
 hard liquor ,  pack more alcohol per pound ,  i always say .
 it &apos;s treason then .
 don &apos;t tell me what i want to see .
 fun fact: assaulting the pope is grounds for an instant excommunication from the catholic church .
 he &apos;s a one-lunged former bouncer .
 pretty tough ,  but still .
 speaking as someone with arthritis in the hand ,  which there’s a good chance he also has at his age ,  it probably hurt like bloody hell .
  &apos;if you like sex without the orgasm then .
 best review done in 3 sentences .
 never heard of the expanse .
 ah yes ,  a much danker timeline .
 255 isnt even the main problem ,  on averge you get what .
 70 blocks of ground to bedrock ?
 you know what would be nice ?
 if it was more diverse than 3 blocks of dirt and 67 of stone and sometimes dirt/ores .
 seriously ,  like am i supposed to bring my laptop to the bathroom like it &apos;s 2006 ?
 imagine being subbed to that place and upvoting multiple of these posts .
 like how is it even entertaining .
 it was just hanging right there .
 we have something bigger and better to replace the predator for the franchise .
 how do you feel about jesus ?
 i imagine the problem isn &apos;t the cost but more the manpower and time frame .
 flint ,  michigan is a city of 96 , 000 attempting to replace a majority of their water service lines due to lead leeching into the water .
 the goal was 18 , 000 lines replaced by 2020 (3 years from 2017 ,  when they started) and they were given $200 million to do it .
 that &apos;s flint ,  michigan .
 a 34 sq mile city of 96 , 000 people given $200 million .
 jakarta is a 255 sq mile city with a population of 11 million people .
 69 billion wouldn &apos;t near be enough money and 5 years wouldn &apos;t be enough time .
 i don &apos;t think even 10 years wouldn &apos;t be enough time .
 if they had not sold the pipe networks in 98 &apos; they &apos;d probably just now be getting close to having most the city covered .
 it sounds like a shitty fucking situation ,  but they may not be so wrong in calling it a lost cause .
 absolutely a failure on absolutely every level of government that this ever became close to being an issue .
 i was really hoping timmy would fucking die today .
 thank you ,  sprog .
 collect them and sell them later at high prices to nasa .
 what would you do-oo-oo ,  for some moon rain poo ?
 that is my favorite stephenson book .
 fantastic worldbuilding and fascinating plot .
 he still does that focus shift thing that tends to happen in the last third of his books ,  but it &apos;s not jarring ,  and keeps carrying the plot forward .
 and it has a strong ending ,  which is uncommon for his works .
 the piss drrrrroplets
  &apos;write that down !
 write that down !
 gotta love any band that names themselves after a shoe .
 and remember not to cross the streams .
 life pro tip find a dmv that is in a small town(like super small) .
 shorter wait ,  road trip and a day off .
 about the same amount of time .
 depending on which canon you use they are the same i think .
 however it was supposed to occur in the 1990s iirc
 doesn &apos;t matter ,  had sex .
 what if the alien men had vaginas that shoot sperm up the female &apos;s penis
 i &apos;d probably have a thing for light blue women .
 of course it &apos;s junji ito ,  horror manga god .
 dementia is a reasonable explanation .
 see videos of young trump and you &apos;ll see a very eloquent idiot .
 these days it &apos;s a rambling mess of ,  what seems to be ,  words of the english language creatively arranged .
 best i can do is omegle and some titties .
 he really didn &apos;t have to apologize in my opinion .
 but he represents a religion and he feels he should push towards peace and understanding rather than aggressiveness .
 that is understandable .
 that exact reason is how i’m here now
 they have a bidet ?
 are you saying that she got off with a slap on the wrist ?
 so like the reality for a number of women ?
 i &apos;d rather watch a 40 minute video essay on how the thing is bad because it was made badly
 robot but i will say this about the expanse: .
 i started it one night after the gf went to bed because i kept seeing ads all over ,  and it was so good that i didn &apos;t stop watching it until i fell asleep on the couch .
 after that i couldn &apos;t stop watching it until i finished season 4 .
 every single episode ends in such a way that you have to watch the next one .
 not in a cliffhanger way ,  but every little revelation just makes you want to keep going .
 it &apos;s got action .
 it &apos;s got sci fi .
 it &apos;s got drama .
 it &apos;s got politics .
 it &apos;s got a noir space detective .
 it &apos;s got mormons .
 the expanse is one of the freshest scifi shows i &apos;ve seen in a long time .
 i have no qualms with putting it up there with star trek and battlestar (probably even better than them in a few ways) .
 for anyone who loves science fiction ,  the expanse is a must
 without exaggerating it is the best sci-fi show the past decade .
 it currently has 93% on rt ,  96% audience ,  and 8 .
 season 3 and 4 has 100% on rt .
 what other timeline would the us blow up an iranian general and potus tweeted “us flag teehee”
 in most worlds ,  i live most of my life underground ,  and i’ve gotta say .
 you’re definitely right .
 i think the main issue is the fact that they &apos;re trying to not go too far from the  &apos;original &apos; minecraft .
 after the end credits were introduced ,  we &apos;ve had a ton of stuff added .
 but it &apos;s always expanded upon something that already existed ,  or doesn &apos;t interfere with what already exists .
 messing with the underground would involve an insane amount of tinkering ,  would change a ton of things ,  and affect nearly everything in the game !
 i fully agree with you .
 but i could see that going badly .
 i have a wrap around triple monitor and gaming optimized tower set up in my bathroom .
  you need to step up your game .
  just make sure to get a padded toilet seat .
 see ,  this isn &apos;t fair at all - if i make a jesus joke ,  i get crucified for it .
 day 3 ,  timmy died .
 somme bodies once told me .
 the world was goin crazy .
 i guess we &apos;re gonna world war again .
 it smells like barbecued dog hair .
 no wonder i never understood the dmv waiting jokes .
 there &apos;s like 1 person in line every time i &apos;ve gone
 that &apos;s what i usually do
 which ,  that episode of voyager bugged me when they ended up going back in time to stop whatshisnuts from benefiting off of the 24th century tech that crashed because of temporal whatever back in the 70s ,  and the voyager crew end up in los angeles in the 90s after whatshisnuts already reverse engineered some of the tech he found .
 it &apos;s great cuz the doc got his mobile emitter out of the deal .
 but you can tell this was firmly in the late 90s when they &apos;re there  but there &apos;s no eugenics war going on .
 and there should &apos;ve been ,  right ?
 the two part episodes aired in november of 96 ,  so i guess the war could &apos;ve happened after that ,  there were still a few years left .
 but it still doesn &apos;t sit right with me .
 i wish i could take back the two seconds it took to read this .
 sometimes when i &apos;m drunk and talking to multiple friends and respond to one comment while also having another story in my head and i jumble them together .
 i &apos;ll say like one sentence with maybe ten words that come out this jumbled .
 but to be this way 24/7 should be completely disqualifying for literally any job .
 i &apos;ve been saying dementia for well over a year .
  with four family members passing from alzheimers or dementia related illnesses ,  i know the signs as do many ,  many others who have had these illnesses touch their lives .
  but one medical doctor says the president is okay and the world believes him .
 just checked ,  still alive as this thread
 they have a garden hose .
 hey ,  we’re doing our best !
 watch the podcast how did this get made ,  its really funny and they just bash on a terrible movie and point out all the flaws for an hour straight .
 its with paul sheer and jason manzukas from the show the league .
 jason manzukas also plays rosa &apos;s crazy boyfriend on brooklyn 99 if you watch that .
 we live in the dankest of all possible worlds .
 please tell me that &apos;s not a real tweet .
 i can &apos;t tell anymore .
 in most worlds ,  i live most of my life underground .
 this sounds weird as fuck out of context
 i mean sure you have a point ,  but at the same time underground is one of the worst things about minecraft ,  its very basic ,  if you have seen one cave you seen them all .
 ores arent better either ,  you get 3 tiers of tools (im not even counting wooden ones as they only exist to get you stone ones) stone ,  iron and diamond ,  and lets be honest ,  this isnt a good progression system .
 other games make better harder and more dangerous to get (stronger enemies or some sort of enviromental danger) .
 meanwhile in minecraft iron is everywhere and the only thing that makes diamonds harder to get is their rarity
 true some people take it overboard with their comments .
 feels like a spear to the side sometimes .
 i live in the city .
 i &apos;ve never had a dmv trip take less than 4 hours .
 and that was a short wait .
 usually it &apos;s that long just to get a chair .
 it’s why i say he’s unfit to be president .
 i don’t care if you think he’s done nothing wrong .
 listen to his speak ,  read his transcripts ,  he’s a literal bumbling fool .
 he talks in circles about literally nothing because none of the things he says makes sense .
 i don’t even want to insult him ,  i’m just trying to describe the way he talks .
 between the way he talks ,  and what he says (wind power ,  coal power ,  his daughter ,  minorities ,  women ,  etc) ,  it’s really a wonder how anyone could deem him fit to rule a nation as executive leader and command in chief .
 certain people who are interesting to televise believe him .
 that doctor was met with quite a bit of scepticism .
 i believe he actually did confirm later that the letter was directed by trump ,  to the surprise of few .
 i also wanna be here
 excuse me sir ,  i’ll have you know i drink from that hose !
 i watched them do space jam live in the fall .
 every other week i &apos;m super bummed they haven &apos;t posted it yet .
 thank you ,  bluntaire ,  voltaire’s stoner brother .
 not quite ,  he just tweeted a 240px us flag with no text
 jesus christ ,  so many comments
 yep ,  our city has around 150k pop and i &apos;ve waited 3+ hours a few times before i learnt to just drive 20 miles to the nearest town of \20k pop and it was a 5 minute wait .
 also the small town one was far friendlier ,  there was free coffee ,  and the person behind the counter helped me avoid a $100 fee .
 yahweh more then i expected .
 i agree that there should be different tags for porn and gore .
 sometimes a person is chill with porn but hates gore ,  or even vice versa .
 ive often clicked on posts tagged nsfw on subs like r/tifu or r/confessions thinking it would be a funny story ,  and then i get bombed with a story about gore or even a photo a couple of times .
 it &apos;d be nice to be able to avoid those .
 i &apos;ve subed to so many subs that have the word  &apos;porn &apos; in it that - apparently - my profile has been flagged nsfw .
 power washing porn ,  sky porn ,  earth porn ,  food porn ,  etc etc .
 add levels of nsfw .
 i &apos;d like to not be banned on various subs just because of my  viewing preferences .
 i &apos;m sooooo sorry if you &apos;ve been flagged for posting on my comment here .
 how was i suppose to know it was going to explode like this !
 perhaps this is the time we bring this to the attention of whoever can fix it ?
 clearly it &apos;s a popular topic .
 i swear i &apos;ve seen a nsfl tag on reddit before
 i would like it personally .
  lots of things are marked nsfw when it &apos;s not really like this post for example .
  but along with that comes porn which i don &apos;t really mind but it also comes with nsfl stuff which i do mind very much .
 spent a good few years looking at some gore shit and it &apos;s definitely colored my view on humanity in general .
  i saw the fucking nipple-belt post about that serial killer on that thanks i hate it sub and it just fucking turned my stomach and ruined my mood .
  it &apos;s not a big deal but i &apos;m really trying to preserve my mood these days .
 sometimes gore-ish stuff gets onto front page ,  like the pics showing the beheading of the french teacher .
 i would have appreciated a warning .
 and didn &apos;t really was interested seeing something like this .
 /dms exploding with dozens of guys asking for links .
 i don &apos;t have one and fuck you all
 that would be nice because i like boobs ,  but not from the inside angle .
 if guts and gore pop up ,  it &apos;s no big deal .
 but i work at a school .
 any sort of porn is like ,  instant fired .
 please ,  for the love of all that is good and sfw .
 porn is a-ok by me ,  but i have a hardline panic trigger for gore .
 nsfl tags are amazing .
 but what if it &apos;s both
 yes i would appreciate this .
 also we n ed a  &apos;spider &apos; flair .
 it would be very useful because i want to see tiddy not a bloody 12 car gang beat up
 i &apos;d block nsfl stuff entirely .
 i don &apos;t care about seeing naked people ,  but it really bothers me seeing dead/dying/very injured people .
 i would like an animal cruelty flair
 i &apos;m a veteran; i love me some nsfw but i hate nsfl .
 myself and lot of others in similar shoes would benefit from two separate flairs .
 very useful ,  it would had prevent me from seeing the beheaded photo of that french teacher a couple weeks ago .
 as a guy who unintentionally saw a leg blackened and eaten down to bone by gangrene ,  yes i think it would be very useful .
 if we had another askreddit post asking this same fucking question again tomorrow and the next day ,  so you think it would be useful ?
  mods this post has hit front page a hundred times ,  how are you not on top of this ?
 i thought nsfl was not safe for florida when i read this
 additionally things that actually aren’t nsfw shouldn’t be labeled as such .
 so like clicking on a blurred out nsfw picture labeled “wife shows off hot pussy” and it’s a picture of dudes wife at the beach with their cat ,  like ,  please stop that .
 i just wish people would tag posts and videos especially about rape ,  violence and such nsfw : way too many times ive cried or almost had a panic attack because i read or saw something .
 i try to be careful about the subreddits im subbed to but its not faultproof .
 yeah i hate when i’m trying to jack off and then some naked chick comes up on my screen
 i really don &apos;t understand why some people are fascinated by gore .
  &apos;here &apos;s a video of a teenage girl getting killed by a cartel gang with her face being peeled off &apos; .
 why would you think for a second that i &apos;d like to see that ?
 fuck off with that shit
 nice try ,  market research firm .
 yes  ,  id much rather look at someone &apos;s ass instead of the rotting carcass of a 12 day old deer
 people don &apos;t know how to use the search function .
 chaos would ensue .
 yes ,  but if there &apos;s a global setting to turn off nsfl entirely .
 i know i &apos;d use that setting .
 sex is life ,  gore is death .
  sex  and nudity ruins only my job ,  gore ruins my mood ,  my life ,  etc .
 i would almost never click nsfl but nsfw would probably always make me curious .
 i am all for it .
 i just don &apos;t like violence at all .
 a wonderful idea but sadly people seem incapable of using or seeing the  nsfw flair as it is now .
 please do ,  reddit
 yes ,  not everyone wants their day ruined by death and gore .
 if we had the choice to click for porn or gore you &apos;d see a big difference in numbers .
 also filter by spoiler tag
 i am actively interested in gorey/ nsfl content ,  unless there &apos;s animals involved ,  and at the same time experience strong discomfort when faced with unexpected sexual content or sexualized nudity .
 to me these two things should definitely be separated ,  because if i already feel annoyed and uncomfortable ,  i can only imagine what it &apos;s like for people the opposite way - expecting a nice pair of tits and being faced with a close-up of some teen who &apos;s blown their brains out .
 that &apos;s gotta kill the mood (if it doesn &apos;t ,  please talk to soneone you trust) .
 this ain &apos;t the first time this feature has been asked for/ proposed ,  and i really wonder why reddit hasn &apos;t picked up on it yet .
 i suppose it would also make the hunt for undesired content easier
 add it and only activate it in november so that people don &apos;t lose nnn
 what about those naughty posts over at r/chairsunderwater ?
 cause i don’t mind porn/nsfw sexual esque stuff but as a person with ptsd i can’t handle gore/violence and i would love that distinction .
 also ,  as a person with trypophobia ,  we could use nsfl for that too .
 wait ,  it’s not already ?
 this is such a softball question lmaoo yes i want to know if i’m about to see boobies or some dude get his brains blown out
 i dont ask much from this site ,  but i would really like that as a change !
 yes ,  it would be fucking useful .
 a fat tiddied ainme milf is differnt to a dead fucking dog
 i would prefer this ,  as i’m into surgery pictures ,  but i don’t want porn in my newsfeed
 kinda tired of having to constantly filter out porn when i come across it .
  too many things are tagged nsfw ,  that i don &apos;t want to block all nsfw ,  but i just don &apos;t want the front page of reddit to have tits and blowjobs on it constantly .
 look ,  we all know where to find porn if we want it ,  i just don &apos;t want to have it everywhere .
  i have a rather large list of blocked porn subs i use res to filter out when i come across them .
  it &apos;s gotten down to a manageable level ,  although ,  new ones still rotate through regularly .
  i &apos;m not going to post them here ,  since it will inevitably offend one or more people  &apos;from &apos; those subs ,  who will retaliate by falsely flag the post for brigading ,  or whatever ,  so pm and i &apos;ll respond with the list .
 for those who like boobs but not beheadings
 thank god i can now filter my gore from my porn 
 once reddit does this they confirm that they are a porn site .
 see i like to live on the edge .
 it’s almost a game .
 titties ,  or a guy who got his arm mangled in an industrial shredder ?
 doesn’t matter , i jack off either way
 yes because titties are nice and violence is horrifying .
 titties nourish and bring joy and provide life  .
 violence and gore are traumatic and unnecessary 
 i know the w stands for work ,  what does the l stand for ?
 i don &apos;t see why not plus it &apos;ll be easier to filter .
 the only problem i can see happening is that it will encourage some really fucked-up posts
 gore doesnt bother me in fictional context but knowing its real unsettles me and tends to fuck me up for hours after .
 i rarely see it on accident here but it has happened and i &apos;d like if it didnt
 what does nsfl stand for
 i mean it &apos;d obviously be useful and i always see full support for it every time this comes up ,  but reddit just won &apos;t implement this .
 you can find threads going years back about this .
 usually people say it &apos;s because reddit doesn &apos;t want to acknowledge that that content is on their site for ad reasons .
 the solution is that any sub that allows gore/injury related stuff should have a tag for it that &apos;s heavily enforced .
 i &apos;ve left several subs because a blurred image turned out to be something horrible .
 yes ,  i could filter out porn ,  which makes my wife mad ,  and still see gore/violence .
 also ,  stop locking posts .
 would be great for nnn
 i wish there was a flair/warning for gore & stuff .
 it &apos;s not something i want to see ,  and it &apos;s quite awful especially when it catches you off guard .
 i &apos;m also sometimes scared to open nsfw-tagges posts because of it .
 i would definitely appreciate such a flair !
 what does nsfl mean ?
 the week after i got married someone posted a photo of a guy who had gotten his wedding ring caught in a fence while climbing it .
 as he fell it removed the skin off his finger .
 that shit scarred me ,  and is totally nsfl .
 i agree with this .
 something more like you see in movie ratings (nudity ,  gore ,  foul language ,  etc) and you can choose multiple .
 honestly my kind of people are chill with porn but hate gore .
 the naked human body ?
 boobs aren’t hurting anyone .
 they feed children and are nice to look at .
 gore serves no purpose whatsoever .
 if you’re okay with gore but not porn then uhhhhhh yeah i don’t think we’re gonna hit it off .
 damn this is really a case of bush v .
 this reminds me of a post in one of the magic mushroom subreddits .
 whenever there &apos;s a nsfw tag 90% it &apos;s just a mushroom that looks like a penis .
 but there was this one where a guy tripped out so hard he shit the bed ,  then when he sobered up he took a picture and posted it .
 i cannot stomach gore .
 whenever i’ve accidentally seen something gory it messes me up for a good while .
 can’t go to sleep without it replaying in my head .
 i absolutely need to be warned about gore so i can avoid it .
 i really can &apos;t tolerate gore and stay away from it as much as i can ,  even if there &apos;s a slight chance that it may be gore i skip it .
  i &apos;m fine with porn ,  even enjoy it ; )
 i literally cannot sort by new .
 or even scroll all because it just turns into porn .
 every type of god damn porn .
 i like porn like the next horny person .
 but i dont want to aimlessly scroll on the bus or at work and come across gross hentai porn .
 idk why they just don &apos;t have a porn tag .
 as a grown as man with a family and responsibilities ,  i like to occasionally fan my immature side with homeless fights ,  vomit/poop funny videos and pictures .
 even the occasional fucked up gore (usually just violence that i know turned out okay ,  like someone snapping their leg at a skate park or something) .
 but i don &apos;t consume porn .
 so it &apos;s also a battle since sooo much is labeled nsfw .
 i &apos;d bet there are more people that don &apos;t want to see gore as those who don &apos;t want to see porn .
 totally agree i hate it when i’m all horny browsing reddit and find a porn related post instead of actual gore .
 and a third tag for gore porn .
 id love it if we could filter out specifically porn ,  not nsfw content ,  or even nudity/sex related stuff .
 i dont like looking at gore but its easy enough to avoid ,  and i have no problem with nudity or sexual content ,  i just wish i could filter out all the totally cringe ,  obviously inauthentic posts from reddit sex workers posting pics of themselves for thirsty fans .
 sex work is totally fine w me ,  porn is totally fine with me ,  it would just be cool to be able to filter out the desperate and thirsty porn posts made for financial gain at the expense of stupid and horny neckbeards .
 im 100% ok with that going on on reddit ,  if it gets to the front page it should be on the front page ,  i know some subs are centered around true exhibitionists and not cringe phonies ,  it would just be super nice to filter out specifically pornography without filtering out any other nsfw content including nudity/sex related posts that are not intentional pornography .
 yea like i’m ok with seeing someone hit by a car ,  but i don’t want porn popping up in public
 power washing porn is intensely sexual to me
 excuse me ,  there is nothing more scandalous than power washing porn in this industry !
 it is more common knowledge now but i really hated that initial trend of subs dedicated to cool ,  specific things tacking -porn on the end .
 i still think it is a dumb trend but i got less weird comments when sharing something from a sfw-porn sub .
 /r/amateurroomporn is the worst offender of this naming scheme .
 i &apos;ve subed to so many subs that have the word  &apos;porn &apos; in it that - apparently - my profile has been flagged nsfw .
 it &apos;s not because you &apos;re subscribed to the porn subs ,  it &apos;s because you comment on posts that are flagged as nsfw .
  like this one .
 i can &apos;t fathom how these subs think it &apos;s a good idea to put  &apos;porn &apos; in their name .
 i &apos;d love to look at some of those subs while doing my due diligence slacking off at work ,  but there &apos;s no way i &apos;m risking clicking on any page with the word porn in the name ,  joke or not .
 i cannot express enough how fucking cringey the  &apos;-porn &apos; subreddit culture is .
  like the things youve mentioned .
 mom (or any fucking person): hey ,  do you know where i can find and discuss some beautiful pictures of the earth ?
 me: uhhhh yeahhhh .
 theres ummm this subreddit .
 ummm earth something or other .
 heh ,  ummm maybe just google some ideas .
 that’s why i subbed to r/nosillysuffix cuz it was ridiculous and kinda cringe how that became a thing .
 also nsfw is used for spoilers sometimes and i’d like to see that as it’s own separate tag .
 so ,  just live streams of redditors at home then ?
 yeah same idk why it did that
 add levels of nsfw .
 i &apos;d like to not be banned on various subs just because of my  viewing preferences .
 sometimes i forget this is a thing .
 i get it if you want to ban people from the cesspools since reddit won &apos;t do it ,  but fucking porn ?
 i think it might have more to do with the fact that you have made a post that is tagged nsfw .
 sonething about birds and bees .
 i consumed so much reddit porn that they changed my username to nsfw .
 yeah ,  it used to be a thing .
 there also used to be a gore tag ,  probably many more .
 weird it was removed .
 some people still use the abbreviations in their title like so at the beginning or end if the post title .
 apparently it wasn &apos;t a  &apos;tag &apos; it was just a flair ,  honestly ,  never noticed it was just a flair .
 it seemed so universally used with similar design .
 certain subs such as /r/fiftyfifty have their own custom tags for nsfl
 ive seen it all over .
 thought it was normalized .
 i swear i &apos;ve seen a nsfl tag on reddit before
 a sub might &apos;ve created their own custom post flair for it .
 there &apos;s never been an official nsfl tag .
 some subreddits might have implemented one as a flair ,  but people have been saying there should be one for at least the 8 years i &apos;ve been on reddit .
 it was probably just added into the title by whoever the op was
 like 8 years ago
 you probably have nswl was for extremely nsfw stuff
 i thought it was a flare option set by the respective mods of subs ?
 i don &apos;t mind gore or porn ,  but sometimes i don &apos;t care to see one or the other at any given time ,  so it &apos;d be nice to know what i &apos;m about to click on .
 yeah i’m not a massive fan of seeing severed heads on the front page on my lunch break
 ed gein &apos;s arts and crafts definitely colors your thoughts for the rest of the day .
 i watched that video 2 guys 1 hammer or something and i knew right then i was traumatized .
 ever since then i can &apos;t watch most horror movies .
 before i could reasonably deny  &apos;oh this is just a movie &apos; .
 but i know it happens .
 we need separate tags for all the current uses ,  nsfw-gore ,  nsfw-nudity ,  and nsfw-spoiler .
 if it’s any consolation ,  the nipple belt was just a replica
 everything from natureismetal is nsfl to me
 what is a nipple belt ?
 is it like a nipple clamp ?
 heavy on the “trying to preserve my mood these days”
 technically ed gein wasn &apos;t a serial killer (2 confirmed murders) ,  just a crazy guy with a hobby of grave robbing for arts and crafts
 yeah ,  for me there’s something deeply upsetting and awful about seeing dead bodies or people in pain on a human level .
 boobies on the other hand i will gladly take ,  assuming i’m not watching at work 
 that pic is of a fake replica nipple belt ,  made from some synthetic material .
 you can unturn your stomach now .
 i &apos;ve been enjoying life too much recently ,  where &apos;s the link ?
 i’ve seen that nipple belt post several times on my feed and i refuse to look at it .
 if the string  &apos;nsfw &apos; appears in the title ,  the post is automatically flaired nsfw .
 that &apos;s why this thread is marked as such .
 i mean you actively went to a sub where people will try to post things you don &apos;t like .
 pretty easy to avoid those plus r/wtf and all similar ones .
 besides that i bet it said nipple belt and you clicked it anyway .
 i saw that nipple belt thing on r/fiftyfifty .
 wasn’t the grossest thing though .
 yeah ,  glad i decided to pass on the nipple belt
 yeah ed gein was a bit of an oddball
 i mean the post was titled accordingly .
 you didn &apos;t have to look at it lol
 beheading of the french teacher ?
 can somebody explain me why did a teacher got beheaded ?
 honestly ,  in the same vein ,  i wish amazon ,  netflix etc would adopt similar ratings systems .
 i’m very ,  very squeamish when it comes to blood and guts (walked out of district 9 and threw up .
 conversely ,  sex doesn’t bother me .
 it’s usually funny .
 though i suppose rape scenes would trigger both categories ,  which i’m obviously not into .
 yeah that was what i was about to say i was just casually scrolling when i saw that it would be nice to at least be able to blure that shit
 i was in bed casually scrolling popular when i came across a graphic photo of a guy who has just gotten in head ripped apart by a bear or something .
 not the image i want in my head when i’m trying to sleep .
 i have no idea why or what post made me sub to r/makemesuffer ,  but that sub wasn’t what i thought based on the first post i saw .
 it’s prob rookie for some but  i’ve seen some literal shit .
 opposite here ,  there &apos;s such a massive amount of porn when you browse r/all that i thought  &apos;hmm maybe i &apos;ll just block nsfw &apos; ,  but that also blocks morbid articles ,  that crazy car crash that happened on the i-90 and the teacher screaming the n-word at their students .
 i don &apos;t mind porn but it &apos;s too much to wade through on the front page .
 i just wish there was a  &apos;porn &apos; tag ,  that &apos;s for porn .
 like that cloud in the sky that looks like a penis is not nsfw ,  i &apos;d like to see that over the 100th hentai pussy for the day .
 hell even blocking nfsw right now would filter this thread from your front page .
 i always thought it was not safe for lunch .
 as in you don &apos;t want to look at it while eating .
 it originally meant not safe for lunch as in it would make you sick but then it got turned into not safe for life over years of people misusing it
 you and i are the only people in this thread who prefer gore over porn apparently .
 gore would be deemed appropriate at my work (in many circumstances ,  at least) but porn not so much .
 yeah i &apos;m fine with watching crazy videos of car crashes and stuff but i &apos;m getting real sick of seeing all these titties on the front page every day
 i try to stay away from subs where i &apos;d ever need to know which it is .
 i feel nsfl stuff should be closely monitored anyway .
 medical stuff makes sense but people here are acting like it &apos;s their god given right to watch videos of people dying .
 i don &apos;t see how they can defend it beyond  &apos;i &apos;m messed up and curious &apos; .
 i get incredibly distressed looking at them .
 i swear reddit is filled with edgy teenagers with something to prove because i have friends in the army and hospital who don &apos;t seek that shit out because they know it &apos;s rightfully not for our fucking entertainment .
 nsfl would most likely overrule
 i’m pretty sure all nsfl stuff is not safe for work
 it &apos;s called  &apos;hentai &apos; and it &apos;s art .
 i don &apos;t think those who ain &apos;t seeking for such stuff should be seeing this kinda stuff in their feed
 i‘ve nearly got a damn heart attack the other day from an frontpage post of a freaking huge ass spider .
 i wish this was a thing so i could avoid my heart jumping out of my chest when i see one randomly in my feed .
 there needs to be a  &apos;nope &apos; flair for stuff like this .
 ya know ,  stuff that would end up on r /nope
 or someone’s decaying corpse
 we can block by tags ?
 if so nsfl tags would be a huge help .
  i have no desire to see morbid stuff .
 i saw the colorized image of one of jack the rippers victims and i thought i was messed up
  &apos;people of reddit what would u think if somebody came up and gave you a billion dollars and then steve buscemi wanted to be ur friend would u like that lol why or why not &apos;
 the fact that i had to scroll 10 miles to see a single comment saying this is kind of pathetic
 if it &apos;s not safe for florida ,   definitely not safe for life .
 the desired result would be the same .
 tw ,  nsfw ,  and nsfl
 not all gore is fucked up torture .
 for instance gore in a medical setting has uses for people in medical or those who just want to learn more about anatomy .
 i used to be really depressed and photos of death or suicides honestly brought me back to earth .
 as fucked up as it is ,  those photos helped me rationalize death and de-romanticize suicide .
 so there can be a positive to some of that stuff .
 morbid curiosity is a very powerful thing .
 plus ,  there are people who are just sick of living in a censored world where everything is sugarcoated; they want to see the dark side of reality .
 it’s also a good reminder of how fragile your life is .
 i mean i am very fascinated by it .
 i guess it just depends on who you are really and how desensitized you are to everything .
 it depends on the ass .
 lets be real though ,  reddit &apos;s search function is hot garbage .
 i get better results on google by searching whatever and putting reddit in the text string .
 how was does gory shit interest you  ?
 i don &apos;t know what i was expecting .
 nsfwp ,  nsfwg ,  nsfwv ,  etc .
 i agree with you maybe just tags like “gore” “sex” etc would be netter than endless nsfw
 you got me with bush v .
 well done my friend .
 i’ll never forget back in what must’ve been nov/dec 2000 ,  on our uk tv channel 5 - which was then known for pretty much only broadcasting erotic thrillers and shitty horror films - the continuity announcer saying “with more bush and gore than the us election ,  here’s the next film”
 gore serves no purpose whatsoever .
 random senseless gore may not ,  but a lot of subreddits with gore absolutely did imo .
 i think it is actually very informative to see some of the violence that is a part of the daily lives of people in the middle east ,  for instance .
 there &apos;s also a lot of  &apos;gore &apos; that is scientifically or medically interesting (if not directly beneficial to your field) ,  for instance .
 like i remember during the boston marathon bombing ,  a picture of a guy holding the artery closed of a dude who got his leg blown off .
 that was cool to know ,  and even helpful info should i ever get myself into a good old fashioned bombing scenario .
 there &apos;s also some surgeries that are gnarly but interesting ,  like a video i saw on here of a subdural hematoma surgery ,  where a dude &apos;s skull is cut open and taken off like a pringles can lid ,  then a giant mass of blood is water-gunned out of his head before his brain is cauterized with an iron .
 finally ,  even some stuff on the old  &apos;watchpeopledie &apos; subreddit was interesting in terms of what can happen for a variety of osha violations ,  or even just giving an appreciation of your life .
 gore ,  real gore ,  can cause ptsd by proxy .
 like ,  watching real footage of a real person having their real head cut off with a real chainsaw is far more brutalizing to the psyche than unexpectedly see some tits .
 i find a lot of porn far more uncomfortable than fake movie gore ,  given the how deeply exploitative the porn industry is .
 i &apos;d be really upset if i accidentally viewed a gif or whatever of abusive style porn .
 there definitely can be purpose to gore ,  but i wouldn &apos;t say most people participating in gore  &apos;communities &apos; are generally doing so in a healthy way .
 i looked up a lot of gore related to trauma while i was going through school because i didn &apos;t really have the stomach for it naturally when it was out of context .
 put me in the moment in the or or out on call and i never had an issue ,  but i had a ton of anxiety and general queasiness running up to or watching a video of it .
 i had to desensitize myself a bit to make sure it was never an issue at work .
 outside of that there is something humbling about it .
 it &apos;s a reminder that we are basically sentient sacks of viscera that are extremely fragile .
 i think everyone could do with some perspective on how fragile life is and how easy and brutally it can be ripped from us ,  but again ,  i don &apos;t think a lot of people engaging with that kind of thing for  &apos;fun &apos; are getting that out of it .
 i understand why people avoid it .
 it &apos;s not a comfortable thing to deal with for the same reason death isn &apos;t for a lot of people ,  but i can say that being exposed to it more than most has given me a greater appreciation for life in general .
 i do agree that any one that doesn &apos;t want to see it needs to be exposed to it forcibly or by accident because the site design is lacking .
 this thread be actin like porn addictions and asexual people don’t exist lol .
 there’s nothing wrong with not wanting to see either one .
 having separate tags is a great idea .
 there’s literally 0 point in judging other people based on what stuff they wanna see when they go online in their free time .
 question: are you referring to real gore ?
 i &apos;m a huge horror fan and don &apos;t really understand the stigma against the genre ,  where people try to make horror fans out to be deranged/twisted .
 we know everything we &apos;re seeing is fake ,  just like the adrenaline rush of getting freaked out or creeped out a bit .
 even hostel gets shit on for being gratuitous ,  but i think it &apos;s a great movie and a critique of snobby/oblivious american tourists going around other countries like they own if ,  plus it touched on trafficking and how money = power
 the weird part is ,  in general media context ,  the opposite is more true ,  people will accept gore more than they will nudity ,  look at all the shows ,  movies and comics that will happily show you someone getting eviscerated ,  but god forbid they show a hint of t&a .
 i just don’t care to look at naked women .
  because by and large it’s always women .
 don’t like boobs or anything .
 i think gore in the terms of medical things is very interesting .
 i don’t want to see screenshots of a snuff film or anything but the medical type gore fascinated me .
 i grew up watching horror flicks so there’s this dissonance whenever i see gore online .
 it doesn’t bug me .
 i mean yeah it’s gross but like ,  idk .
 it’s the fact that there’s a dead human being that bothers me ,  not that the facebook guy looked gross when he shot himself ,  yknow ?
 porn makes me uncomfortable bc i’m asexual (i think ,  who tf knows and i don’t really care at this point) and sex is just weird for me personally .
 clarification: nudity doesn’t bother me .
 it’s just a body .
 pornography ,  in its current state ,  does .
 like people doing extremely kinky shit or stuff that does not look pleasing at all for either party .
 who knows if that’ll change in the future ,  maybe i’m just suuuuper picky with my partners .
 i can’t bank on the future and maybe i’ll meet someone for whom i have sexual attraction .
 my point is ,  whether you’re asexual ,  lgbt ,  whatever; we’re all a little fluid so don’t try to harp too much on sexuality .
 that edit made my day lmao
 honestly my kind of people are chill with porn but hate gore .
  &apos;i don &apos;t have such weaknesses &apos;
 i’m the exact opposite for some reason
 gore serves no purpose whatsoever .
 neither does poetry .
 doesn &apos;t stop people from wanting to see it and some even liking it .
 then there’s me ,  who likes boobs and also slaying demons
 how do you not like gore ?
 your edit got me .
 i agree with you on all points .
 something to maybe consider though ,  a different nsfw for naked bodies and then actual porn or penetration/sexual acts .
 because a naked woman or man isn’t really pornographic .
 and as a woman most porn i cringe at because i know if that woman wasn’t getting paid there’s no way she would endure getting violently pounded by a 9in dick .
 that shit hurts .
 i dont want to accidentally see a picture of some shit ,  ya know ?
 heck ,  even just reading descriptions of some of that stuff has a bit of that effect on me .
 i don &apos;t even always have to see it ,  my imagination does all the work .
 i guess it &apos;s just knowing people are suffering or dying .
 fake movie gore doesn &apos;t affect me whatsoever ,  because i know it &apos;s all fake .
 i can watch horror movies all day ,  it &apos;s just fun .
 i can even handle some real-life stuff sometimes if i know everyone came out of it okay .
 but any actual footage of someone dying or getting seriously hurt can literally be sickening and won &apos;t get out of my head for days .
 i &apos;m fine with porn ,  even enjoy it ; ) .
 you &apos;re making me uncomfortable with such vulgar talk .
 i know a guy whose throat was pierced by his powerwashingmachine while powerwashing his car ,  what an awful sight that was .
 idk if it &apos;s sexual to you
 your kink is not my kink ,  but your kink is ok .
 oh yeah you &apos;d never expect /r/worldpolitics to be even nsfw
 it kind of sabotages their own potential viewership .
 can &apos;t really surf those subreddits while at work .
 agreed ,  its fucking cringey
 was really sad when i found out that there was no pornon r/historyporn
 i wanted to show reddit to my mom because i think she would appreciate pretty pictures .
 well it was not easy to explain why i wanted her to sub to /r/earthporn  .
 i used to complain about the tumblr trend of  &apos;fuckyeah &apos; as a prefix for enthusiast blogs (eg .
 fuckyeahscience ,  fuckyeahdestiel) but y &apos;know what ,  at least it doesn &apos;t have the actual word porn in it
 /r/humanporn (sfw) is pretty high up that list
 99% of the traffic to that sub is that gif of abe simpson walking into a room ,  hanging up his hat ,  putting his hat back on ,  and leaving .
 thank you for the warning ,  i was just about to comment on it .
 dodged a bullet there !
 one comment on one nsfw post is enough for the profile to be flagged nsfw .
 because users might stumble upon that one comment on one post when browsing the post/comment history of said user .
 they also literally have posts in other subs marked as nsfw so
 there is ,  or at least used to be ,  r/nosillysuffix ,  which collated all those posts .
 it looks defunct now though ,  with no new posts in two years .
 my mom looked so disappointed in me when i tried explaining why it was called foodporn .
 spoilers do have their own tag
 it was removed as reddit got bigger  it was a commonly used flair that looked the same as the current nsfw label thing .
 either way reddit has since wanted to distance itself from subreddits that are dedicated to things like that .
 this is the reason we will never see a nsfl or similar tag ,  it would represent the company accepting in some sense the things that are posted which is bad for advertising .
 no there never wasn &apos;t ,  am an active redditor since 2010 (on my fourth account) .
 it was a css hack that worked only on desktop with stylesheets on .
 what does the l stand for ?
 individual subs would use as post flairs ,  that &apos;s it
 there never has been .
 i thought so ,  i even went to the sub to check
 sweet mary jane why did i click into that sub and look around ?
 really would have liked you to say  &apos;so it &apos;d be nice to know what im about to masturbate to .
 i would really suggest for your porn use to make a alt account and basically only subscribe to porn subs of your liking and only use your home feed for your personal time .
 my chinese made tablet doesn &apos;t work properly .
  it just googles pictures of dead tibetans .
  i don &apos;t lose any momentum but i like a little variety when i jack off .
 what’s subs are you in where you’re coming across severed heads without wanting to ?
 i made the mistake of browsing all and not looking at the title ,  and saw the exact post you were talking about .
 i really wish you could blacklist some stuff because there &apos;s just so much nsfl nightmare fuel
 i saw a severed child &apos;s head being held up by terrorists on the front page once .
 i really would have preferred to not see that .
 i think it kind of numbs you to it after a bit which really can &apos;t be healthy
 3 guys 1 hammer and funky town will forever be a nope for me .
 just reading about it makes me sick so i can’t imagine watching it
 3 guys 1 hammer fucked me up .
 my grandparents were ukrainian
 spoiler is already a specific separate (non-nsfw) tag .
 huge consolation ,  actually .
 i accidentally saw it due to this imagus extension i use for hovering over links .
 sometimes it triggers just mousing over stuff without hovering .
 i really wanted to unsee that belt .
 if i was looking at a replica ,  yeah that makes a big difference .
 man ,  out of all the stuff i &apos;ve seen on reddit ,  nipple belt has never bugged me despite all the reposts .
 snuff films with people begging are absolutely the worst shit i &apos;ve seen .
 gore ,  dismemberment ,  it can be rough .
 poor ed just wanted to do some arts and crafts with pieces nobody needed anymore .
 we do seem to live on a wildly violent planet .
 i don &apos;t mind that one because most of the time it &apos;s nature ,  but i have seen skinned humans on there before ,  that caused me to unsub lol
 no its literally a belt made of nipples
 i haven &apos;t seen the post ,  but i know what they &apos;re talking about .
 google  &apos;ed gein belt &apos; .
 i browsed by new/rising & all/popular and clicked to expand on multiple links .
  seen it before but just not in the right place to be seeing shit like that right now .
 the guy who beheaded the teacher was a muslim and he was offended by cartoons of the prophet muhammad that the teacher showed in a class on free speech .
 showing a picture of muhammed .
 drew a cartoon of mohammed and got killed by a muslim radical :/
 you don &apos;t read the news ?
 it &apos;s not meant in a hostile way i just wonder how anyone could have missed this .
 district 9 is the only movie i &apos;ve walked out of in a theater .
 it wasn &apos;t really the gore though--it was a scene where they &apos;re bringing aliens into a room one by one to kill them and they &apos;re visibly terrified ,  because they know they &apos;re about to die .
 it was a pretty intense movie that already had me upset but their terror and desperation and helplessness in that scene just broke me .
 i also walked out of saving private ryan in a film history class i was in; it was during the d-day scene and again it wasn &apos;t the gore itself but the desperation of the soldier crying for his mom while he lay dying .
 might make more sense to make a separate porn tag if they don &apos;t want to add an official nsfl one ,  i agree .
 i like the medical stuff and the morbid reality .
 tits don’t really do it for me though .
 kind of ,  it can sometimes contain really depressing or innocence losing stories for example .
 like the first time you read lord of the flies or 1984 type of feeling .
 my lunches are sad enough that i wouldn &apos;t mind that .
 i always thought it was life ,  as in ,  don &apos;t watch this is you want to just keep going on with your life today .
 am i dumb ,  or does that make any sense at all ?
 now i &apos;m not sure even .
 i never knew this i assume from the first time i saw the acronym and the content associated with it that it meant life .
 it just made sense .
 of course lunch does too ,  by life marks a more significant escalation ,  in that even if it didn &apos;t jeopardize your job ,  you would still not want to experience it .
 count me in also
 i don’t necessarily prefer it ,  but i’d like to be able to choose .
 can’t be lookin at porn at work but gore is fine .
 porn at home is fine ,  but gore isn’t my thing .
 it would be nice if we could add more than 1 flair .
 what &apos;s annoying is that people think nsfw and  &apos;porn &apos; are interchangeable .
 people will post a picture of a woman in an incredibly scantily clad bathing suit where the nipples and vagina are barely not visible ,  and say it &apos;s sfw because there are no genitals .
 i was gonna say this .
 common phobias/triggers should be another flair .
 they &apos;re just as upsetting to some people .
 i &apos;m not even that afraid of spiders ,  but it is a bit annoying sometimes when i randomly see them in places like r/aww .
 spiders are such a divisive creature ,  you &apos;re just as likely ,  if not more likely ,  to view them as horrifying as you are to see them as cute .
 sure ,  some people think they &apos;re aww-inducing ,  but i scroll through there looking for shiny-eyed kittens and fluffy puppies ,  not tarantulas .
 also pimple flair pls
 keep going ,  i &apos;m almost there
 you can block nsfw stuff ,  so maybe you &apos;d be able to with nsfl too ?
 mind explaining how did that look ?
 since i do not wish to see it
 ok but this is reddit so gore = fucked up shit
 yep ,  true crime has always been a very popular genre and interest in murderers has made a significant come back recently .
 it &apos;s all the same ,  and a huge percentage of people are curious about it
 feel like mid to late 00’s internet desensitized a lot of us .
 wild place back then .
 hard agree on that .
  it &apos;s kinda sad really
 genuinely curious ,  why is it so bad ?
 i know the site has a lot of content and different ways to store ,  tag ,  or parse that data but i can legitimately type the post title word-for-word and get nothing remotely close to the post .
 almost always better to just use a search engine instead of reddit .
 just like pixiv &apos;s ratings of r-18 and r-18g
 nsfwv - not suitable for west virginia ?
 what is not suitable for west virginia ?
 p = peener ,  g = gore ,  v = vsauce ,  michael here ?
 it works on so many levels as well .
 what i’m trying to say is that the only place we’re nudity and gore intersect is florida (because everyone and everything is fucked up in florida) .
 completely threw my train of thought off .
 i &apos;m not a doctor ,  but i follow r//medizzy because the things people do to repair their bodies is amazing to me .
 be forewarned ,  this sub includes a lot of traumatic injury ,  tumors ,  and necrosis .
 watchpeopledie really made me respect my life .
 i was suicidal at one point ,  and witnessing the immediate terror and grief of those who were actually there was a strong deterrent for me .
 to this point ,  sometimes people need to see it for it to feel real .
 you can hear about bombings or tragedies from the past but pictures carry a lot more weight .
 not to glorify the situation but to allow people to really care .
 or in like medical subs where they perform surgeries and stuff ,  thats really interesting to me and i’d actually rather see that than some naked chick (most of the time at least)
 i agree with this .
 i dont think gore has no purpose or whatever ,  i know it fascinates some people and they like to see it from a medical standpoint ,  and i think thats totally fine .
 it can be very interesting to just see how the body works .
 but some people like me can &apos;t handle seeing or reading that stuff .
 i mean your descriptive comment was even a bit much for me and make my stomach turn .
 if there was a tag for that ,  it &apos;d be much easier for people who can &apos;t handle it to avoid it ,  and allow people who are interested to see it .
 gore also reminds us that we &apos;re mortal and it could be any of us in that person &apos;s place ,  or at least that &apos;s how i look at it sometimes .
 any given day we could be going down the interstate and catch a brick to the face ,  it &apos;s humbling in a way .
 taking away the gore makes it much harder to realize the natural world doesn &apos;t care about you .
 even a lot of /r/watchpeopledie was beneficial to some people .
 i used to visit it every now and then .
 it not only showed me how some people in the world have to live and deal with ,  but reminded me that life is precious and no matter how bad i think it might be ,  it &apos;s not nearly as bad as it could be .
 gratuitous gore vs medically interesting gore would be a great filter ,  then .
 in the late 90 &apos;s i had seen a few photos of the aftermath of various bombings in israel .
  one particular photo of what happened to a guys face in a bus bombing still haunts me .
 at the time it served to make me hate terrorism and hatred itself .
   in retrospect ,  it also prepared me for what i saw at the wtc on 9/11 .
 so it does serve a purpose .
 call it education .
  even in the form of medical stuff , i get it .
 but gore for it &apos;s own sake ?
 seeing mutilated and broken bodies as entertainment ,  or interest .
 it indeed needs it &apos;s own tag .
 and ya what you said ,  it definately gives you an understanding of the crazy shit that happens/normal in other countries .
 makes you appreciate being in u .
 i wouldn &apos;t say i have ptsd but i know for sure watching a girl from a cartel getting beat and then burned to death ,  really fucked with me .
 i &apos;m not the kind to report things normally but i straight reported that shit .
 facebook said it didn &apos;t violate their user guidelines and kept it up .
 gave up on facebook then and there .
 yeah but porn can get pretty damn traumatic these days too .
 and what the hell does the l stand for in this ?
 not safe for lunch ?
  when i was a kid my dad only wanted to watch r-rated movies with us cause he thought age appropriate stuff was boring .
  i saw all the saw movies when i was in elementary/middle school ,  for example .
  anyway i think both the gory and sexual rated-r movies messed with me ,  but i still have some lingering issues from one specific rated-r for sexuality movie that i saw with him ,  but i don’t think i have any from the gory ones except not really liking horror movies .
 bdsm is such a strange thing .
 some spanking and such isn &apos;t that bad .
 bondage is on the lines of oddness then you have the choking and shit which is just wow to me .
 my issue with porn these days is the fucked up incest shit that is being spread around .
 like seriously ,  who is enjoying this porn of a guy fucking their mom to the point of even extremely old porn is being re-uploaded with incest titles .
 oh yeah ,  the super super stretched out holes gross me out .
 that &apos;s like gore for me .
 i accidentally clicked a picture of a dick on r/atbge the other day .
 usually on that sub the nsfw is because of a raunchy tattoo or statue or something but no ,  straight up dick painted to look like pickle rick .
 not even saying the concept was unfunny ,  it just wasn &apos;t cute to see a dick when i wasn &apos;t expecting one .
 people are obviously talking about real gore though .
 you can &apos;t compare real porn with fake gore .
 i &apos;m very squeamish and i &apos;d find a nsfl tag very useful if it also covered simulated gore .
 there &apos;s always wiggle room though ,  i &apos;m okay with movie gore when it &apos;s really obviously fake but what &apos;s obviously fake to me might not be obviously fake to someone else .
 seeing porn presented so casually everywhere just chips away at you a bit .
 i &apos;m strangely different about gore; i can &apos;t take slice-and-dice horror flicks ,  but have no problems with stuff irl ,  which is a good thing since my first job was a phlebotomist in a big city hospital .
 but yeah ,  i &apos;d love to see different flairs for these .
 i can’t even handle movie gore .
 even if i know it’s fake ,  it still looks real and that’s enough .
 so i can’t imagine how i’d react to seeing real gore .
 and i’d rather not find out .
 it would be difficult but i &apos;d give it the old college try .
 power washer deep throat
 wow ,  thanks for the warning .
 i &apos;m power washing one of my dragon boat team &apos;s boats this weekend ,  so i &apos;ll be extra careful .
 you can go over to /r/anime_titties for some actual world news if you &apos;d like .
 too be fair it is a fairly new development ,  from a few weeks/months ago .
 now if you &apos;re looking for it you need to go to r/anime_titties
 almost spit out my mcdonalds big mac with a large fries and fanta orange when reading this .
 to be fairrrrrrrr
 “check out this really beautiful photo i found on .
 it loses meaning after a while ,  but when you think about it it’s so childish
 yes agreed - one of the worst trends from the early .
 idk ,  that picture of that guy who &apos;s definitely fucking that kangaroo seems pretty nsfw to me .
 why can &apos;t they just hide it ?
 yeah but some on the app and other subreddits still show up as nsfw when it’s a post .
 didn &apos;t it get removed at the same as subs like watchpeopledie got removed ?
 i remember when r/watchpeopledie was around .
 i wasn’t a subscriber but i’d occasionally see videos of people getting electrocuted or the results of poor firearm safety .
 if anything ,  that sub made me realize how easily people can die when people are complacent .
 not safe for life
 i assumed that was implied .
 we are on the internet after all
 i love this idea because when i’m trying to look at some titties ,  i ain’t trying to see some dudes arm sliced open to the bone .
 in my eyes ,  here &apos;s how to reddit ,  porn and allv .
 i just use one account ,  browse r/all only ,  and simply block every sub or user that isn &apos;t to my tastes .
 also ,  i never check my replies (180 inbox messages and counting !
 ) though i will return to a comment i &apos;ve made through my own history if i &apos;m interested in the conversation going on there .
 using this method ,  i have the best reddit experience i &apos;ve ever had .
 with the  &apos;not checking replies &apos; deal ,  who cares that i made cringey comments on some bbw ?
 see ,  sometimes the usual stuff isn &apos;t up to the task ,  and one heads to r/randnsfw for a different experience ,  discover new things .
 however ,  right now that is also like playing god damned russian roulette .
 gotta stare at only the subreddit name first ,  can &apos;t let your eyes wander even a little bit or one moment you are looking at boobs ,  the next ,  bloody exploded human intestines or something .
 you can do a private custom feed as well .
 that’s what i do .
 that &apos;s why i use multireddits .
 i put all my porn into a multireddit that only i can see ,  and don &apos;t subscribe to it so it &apos;s not on my feed .
 in their defence it was pretty well labelled but i wasn’t really thinking just got off a long shift and was enjoying my lunch
 it was on r/popular last week so it was forced on you wether you liked it or not .
 pepperidge farm remembers
 8 years or so ago at least ,  one of the default subs regularly had gore and dead bodies .
 is wtf still a default ?
 that &apos;s the one i remember ,  unsubscribed from that one quick .
 there &apos;s an option to filter subreddits out of r/all .
 right side on /all ,  below the main banner .
 i have nsfw censoring off cause i don &apos;t care about seeing some dong or titties .
 i enjoy browsing r/all and every now and then r/meddizzy pops up and i fucking hate that shit .
 i &apos;m somewhat desensitized to gore .
 went through a stage in my life .
 more of a  &apos;wow people are fucked ,  and humans are so fragile &apos; fascination .
 but i can &apos;t stand seeing it anymore .
 it just makes me sad .
 and i sure as hell don &apos;t want people looking over my shoulder and seeing that shit pop up randomly .
 oh and how the fuck am i supposed to feel good about recommend ing reddit to others when they will be blasted with gore constantly ?
 it &apos;s all around stupid as fuck they don &apos;t have an nsfl tag ,  let alone allowing it at all .
 i also could’ve lived without seeing those three words together too 
 not only a replica ,  but a computer render too .
 i felt the same way
 if you find the post ,  the comments point out that apparently the originals were destroyed so the one seen on reddit was an artist’s remake ,  probably based on the pictures kept for evidence .
 i &apos;m gonna now commit self-deleteus
 didn &apos;t realize how much i didn &apos;t need to see that until after i clicked .
 its not that bad .
 have i just seen too much worse stuff ?
 i thought it was going to be worse .
  well i guess i need to get off the internet .
 he didn &apos;t draw it ,  he showed a cartoon from the magazine charlie hebdo ,  whose offices were attacked and many people killed for that same cartoon years ago .
 many wwii veterans had a hard time with that movie because of that scene .
 the worst part is that they said that was a tame version of what it was actually like .
 aye im reading lord of the flies so i can finally relate to something book related
 there are dozens of us !
 lol but honestly ,  i usually browse r/all and would love to filter out the porn .
 there &apos;s a time and a place for that .
 but as for gore ,  generally it can be very interesting when it is a unique medical condition ,  or trauma repair etc .
 i &apos;m not interested in watching people die ,  but i like to see the crazy stuff the human body is capable of .
 i &apos;m usually down to see something like that ,  but i don &apos;t particularly care for just hardcore porn while chilling though .
 what have i seen
 this is just the kind of thing i need to beat no nut november !
 that &apos;s a link that can stay blue ,  thanks .
 flayed face ,  naked ,  the way the knife wounds were it was clear that jack was on top of her as he cut and slashed her to bits ,  her breasts had been cut off and her abdominal region had been opened so he could cut out her reproductive organs
 that &apos;s a bit unfair .
 yes ,  the more obvious and showy parts of reddit would treat it like that ,  but reddit &apos;s such a big big place and there &apos;s so many different types of communities .
 i &apos;d be shocked to find there wasn &apos;t some innocent medical subreddit out there sharing gory pictures for educational benefit somewhere around .
 90s internet fucked me _all_ up ,  man .
 don &apos;t know why it &apos;s hot garbage ,  but it has always been bad .
 i don &apos;t understand why they don &apos;t incorporate google search into the site .
 in fact ,  i don &apos;t understand why this site hasn &apos;t really improved much since .
 not safe for west virginia
 g for gore or g for general ?
 am in florida ,  can confirm
 i just wanted to add - there is pragmatism involved as well even if it is not for medicinal purposes .
 do any of the professionals you know completely freeze up due to the shock of gore ?
 because that &apos;s what happens to most people .
 i &apos;m not a medical professional ,  so i have no immediate reason to study or prepare for this situation .
 its just anxiety .
 i dont want to freeze .
 i don &apos;t want to be scared when someone leg snaps in half and needs me .
 but the shortened version of this answer is  &apos;curiosity &apos; ,  and there &apos;s a lot of people that don &apos;t get that .
 its frustrating because it is hard to watch and unsettling but my fear of shock is worse than my distaste for the material .
  i just want to be prepared for an inevitable part of my life ,  and i don &apos;t want to hide from the death all around us like most people do .
 it &apos;s weird ,  i &apos;m not squeamish seeing gore in a medical setting and surgeries .
 but i am not good at seeing graphic pictures of stuff like car accidents or animal attacks on humans .
 this is the reason i didn &apos;t kill myself (even though it still is there in my mind and i have a plan) and finally received treatment .
  i have also told my family it &apos;s a possibility as a jic so they know it &apos;s me not them .
  i know i don &apos;t want anyone to suffer due to the aftermath and in no way would it not hurt someone ,  including those in emergency and medical services .
 gore as in schindler &apos;s list ?
 maybe even going one further and allowing to turn off the gore posts so anything with the tag just doesn &apos;t show .
 just like they already do with nsfw .
 i can sort of handle some gore ,  but generally i avoid it because i never know when something will be too much .
 it &apos;d be nice to just turn it off and not worry about what i &apos;m going to see if i open a post .
 yeah ,  that &apos;s something i &apos;ve never understood .
 why is nudity and sex considered more offensive than people being tortured and killed ?
 that &apos;s the kind of shit that should be removed ,  especially if it &apos;s just being posted somewhere it doesn &apos;t belong for shock value .
 i don &apos;t think we should censor all gore or anything like that ,  but it should have more restrictions on where it can be than porn ,  not less .
 it just wasn &apos;t cute to see a dick when i wasn &apos;t expecting ones .
 unsolicited dick pic senders take fuckin note tyvm
 if it was a violent act ,  like an isis beheading or something ,  sure - it &apos;s worse .
 but i &apos;d rather see a gnarly injury ,  within the context that the person is now okay ,  than most mainstream porn .
 i &apos;m all for a nsfl tag for simulated and real gore as well .
 i just didn &apos;t like the comparison the op made between porn and gore ,  as if porn was fairly harmless because it &apos;s natural .
 porn is rarely natural ,  just like movie violence isn &apos;t ,  and i would say porn is much more harmful to the human psyche than horror .
 horror has actually been proven to be great at treating anxiety .
 but again ,  i &apos;m not sure if the op was referring to real or simulated gore .
 i absolutely abhor the snuff films i sometimes run into on here
 ah ,  there it is .
 i learned the word  &apos;phlebotomist &apos; yesterday so i was waiting for it to start showing up all the time .
 we really should have a tag for that
 he died unfortunately
 hahah how did that switch happen ?
 my favorite is r/trees and r/marijuanaenthusiast
 i &apos;m very confused .
 i was reading a post there ,  then my so asked what sub it was on .
 did you blend all of that into some sort of smoothie ?
 plus ,  let &apos;s be honest ,  until the day that we actually encounter intelligent life from another planet ,  isn &apos;t all porn earth porn ?
 i come to reddit for serious content only ,  not to see childish names used as a joke .
 nsfw ,  nsw ,  what’s the difference ?
 truly seems like the most reasonable option .
 nah ,  i &apos;ve been here for way longer than that and nsfl was custom css on those subreddits .
 i &apos;m just glad the subreddit watchkidsdie was removed .
 50/50 is still very much a thing and sometimes contains gruesome stuff .
 lol i had the same question and the only thing that made sense was “not safe for lunch”
 if it &apos;s not safe for me ,  i &apos;m not watching it
 and 1 cool picture
 ya ,  but sometimes you &apos;re ready to go ,  click ,  and some naked chick pops up ,  with her skin on .
 ruins the mood .
 just here to make it 181 replies
 don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever understand how anyone would enjoy browsing /r/all .
 has always seemed like an awful idea to me .
 well if you’d ever like to learn more about the mad man behind that belt ,  just research ed geins .
 he made furniture and lamps too .
 yea me too ,  i dont know why i was expecting something different ,  its literally nipple belt .
 nope ,  i have seen worse stuff too ,  i was just not expecting that .
 its literally nipple belt .
 that’s a very underwhelming reaction lmao
 unfortunately it wasn &apos;t the end of it ,  there were several more attacks in response because france &apos;s leader condemned the attacks and stated he will protect freedom of speech and expression .
 muslims have been calling for boycotts of france ,  condemning him ,  and a few released caricatures of him as the devil all while supporting the actions of the attackers .
 and i think the teacher asked the student &apos;s wether if they were comfortable with that
 you wanna know the real bad thing .
 some muslim students in germany found it right to kill him
 crazy how charlie hebdo was the biggest news for a month ,  and it seems most have already forgotten about it .
 guess there’s just too much crazy shit going on to keep track of all of it .
 i read it as a child and it traumatized me .
 i read a lot of traumatizing things as a child ,  come to think of it .
 flowers in the attic ,  jungi ito works ,  etc .
 perverts at their most depraved .
 i mean he said not to go there
 i &apos;d be shocked to find there wasn &apos;t some innocent medical subreddit out there sharing gory pictures for educational benefit somewhere around .
 west virginian here ,  i &apos;m scared shitless
 not safe for mountain mama
 what would not safe for west virginia be ?
 a video of aoc saying  &apos;coal ,  bad .
 r-18g is for gore and such
 a lot of people here have valid opinions but usually you can tell what the image is going to be based off the post title so its not really a big deal .
 if you’re blood shy and wanna get better try to volunteer at a old age home or a blood donation site .
 videos and pictures don’t prepare you in the slightest .
 if anything it gives you a false level of confidence .
 i am now a nurse but when i was a kid i’d turn white and pass out when i saw the blood first trail out of the iv .
 now i kinda like watching it .
 the first thing they teach you in any cpr or first aid class is about people freezing up .
 it doesn &apos;t have much to do with the sight of blood .
 and the way we teach medical professionals to not freeze up at the site of blood is by residencies & real world experience .
 showing them pictures of blood wouldn &apos;t do fuck-all .
 when i was a boy scout ,  i taught dozens of other boy scouts how to save lives &apos; & avoid freezing up .
 what we didn &apos;t do was expose 12 year olds to faces of death .
 what we did do is ask them not to spout off complete bullshit they don &apos;t know anything about .
 most responsible adults know at least a little first aid .
 it is amazing how the most irrational shit will become upvoted .
 hurt people doesn’t bother me terribly but i can’t take hurt animals .
 honestly that’s true though .
 like at least schindler’s list is teaching crucial historic lessons .
 saw is just some dumb bullshit 
 i agree violence is way worse than most porn .
 i hate when i click on a  &apos;funny &apos; video on here or facebook and it &apos;s someone getting seriously hurt .
 i don &apos;t enjoy that .
 if the person is ok and laughing ,  that &apos;s fine .
 i usually define it as  &apos;hospital vampire &apos; .
 why don &apos;t you put a question on r/askreddit ,  see what other people &apos;s opinion of it is
 nsfe if you cannot bleach them right away .
 how did that happen .
 trip and fall or something ?
 /r/worldpolitics mods didn &apos;t like the idea of exercising control over its userbase ,  so the userbase realized they could post whatever they wanted with no consequences .
 so they started flooding it with lots of porn (at first ,  largely hentai) and stupid memes .
 people who didn &apos;t like all the porn and stupid memes branched off to create their own subreddit for world politics: /r/anime_titties .
 i personally prefer /r/potatosalad  and /r/johncena
 some guy posted some really dumb stuff about trump (basically just ‘trump sucks’) without an article or anything .
 people asked the mods to delete it because it wasn’t really politics .
 mods said “no because free speech .
 ” so the people realized that if the mods just wouldn’t remove anything they could flood it with whatever .
 there &apos;s an explanation on the sub ,  but the short story is that the politics sub got raided for a few months and devolved into memes ,  and so the new sub is a joke on that while actually having world news .
 probably much easier to consume if you &apos;ve got two broken arms .
 username is not congruent with statement made .
 new south fuckin wales and just plain old new south wales .
 i saw nsfl on subs like fifty fifty
 makes it not fun at all
 i actually like that better
 that &apos;s okay ,  i &apos;ll watch it .
 hold the fuck up
 i do it plenty ,  but i &apos;ve hidden quite a few subs that i know i absolutely never want to see .
 nah it was something like r/makemesuffer or something ,  it was the poor french guy who got slaughtered in the street not too long ago
 warning for those curious:  .
 the first post is an untreated diabetic foot !
 do not click it !
 it’s rotting worse than you can imagine !
 yes let’s go with that
 i just don &apos;t know what to say .
 this world is fucked up
 i mean ,  what ewould you have preferred ?
 muslims have been calling for boycotts of france .
 i mean that would be great for everyone ,  they can go and behead each other as much as they want ,  away from france .
 well lots of muslims everywhere did too .
 wasn’t just in germany .
 no one in france certainly forgot .
 and as it happens ,  trials related to the attack had begun this fall .
 pretty sure everyone feels very reminded about it right now .
 i &apos;m not so sure about that one though .
 also the poll they &apos;re doing on r/medizzy tells us that most people there aren &apos;t working in the medical field .
 maybe some of them nonetheless are there for education ,  but i assume most are on this sub for the entertainment in seeing what kind of extreme stuff the human body can withstand
 yeah it’s the ones when you think it’s just gonna be a funny fail then end up scrolling the comments to see whether they lived or died that i wanna avoid honestly .
 i don’t mind gore too much but a chance to know when to avoid it would be a plus .
 sounds like a great idea
 if only someone did that .
 reddit is a strange place
 you know ,  i &apos;m surprised that /r/anime_titties wasn &apos;t already a thing
 my favorite part in all this was when they changed the banner for r/worldpolitics into a picture of anime tits ,  and the nipples were the o &apos;s .
 thus the name for the new sub was born .
 i &apos;m sorry clue me in on why in the world it &apos;s called john cena
 why is r/potatosalad empty ?
 can &apos;t see shiz !
 i know of a guy who gained weight that way .
  with his jaw wired shut (broken bone) .
  blended up pizzas and drank ‘em through a straw the whole 8 weeks he was healing .
   gained 20 lbs .
 css is the written  &apos;code &apos; that mods can implement on their subreddit that dictates appearances as well as numerous functional capabilities .
 it &apos;s not an official toggle on reddit though ,  just a custom flair option you can select ,  if i remember correctly .
 it &apos;s a subreddit flair ,  not an official reddit tag .
 higher on the usage but lower on the scale of making sense .
 ya ,  that &apos;s basicly my response in that situation too !
 sounds like it made you suffer ,  so pretty effective .
 furiously checks own diabetic feet ,  sighs in relief they are normal .
 how do you not notice .
 the world is awesome .
   it &apos;s many of the humans on it that suck .
 lol exactly ,  they say that like that’s not what people want .
 if someone is extreme enough that someone else enacting their freedoms makes them want to leave the country ,  they should probably leave .
 honestly ,  if the pictures were posted with consent from the necessary parties and the person isn &apos;t using them for some sort of nefarious purpose ,  i don &apos;t see any reason you wouldn &apos;t be innocent there .
 if a part of me got mangled up and i uploaded it anywhere on reddit ,  i really wouldn &apos;t care if some person is looking at it just because he thinks it &apos;s fun or any other personal reason that &apos;s none of my business in their own space .
 hell ,  if that happened to me ,  i probably would upload it just to get some spare karma .
 i mean ,  what &apos;s really the worst part of that ?
 i totally missed the word innocent .
 also didn &apos;t check the poll .
 most comments i saw there were of medical professionals .
 but those subreddits definitely cater to a niche who don &apos;t get grossed out and are intrigued to learn more about the human body .
 real gore is different than fake gore ,  too .
 i don &apos;t want to see broken bones and someone &apos;s insides while they scream in pain .
 i don &apos;t get enjoyment from that .
 it seems lots of people do and to me that &apos;s really fucked up
 honestly ,  it &apos;s probably a gold mine for people who study social interactions for a living .
 the great thing is ,  if you get kinda sick of all the damned content clogging up reddit ,  you can subscribe to r/goodcardibsongs and r/amish .
 but it’s awesome
 weebs hate underscores lol
 potato salad is a safe choice to bring to a potluck .
 most people will eat it and like it will enough .
 however ,  its kinda bland and isn &apos;t loved like a few other foods are .
 same with john cena .
 never change ,  reddit .
 oh my god that was genius
 the world isn’t even awesome .
 think of all the natural disasters and diseases we had nothing to do with .
 but if fewer humans suck ,  maybe gradually we can make the world suck less .
 people behave much differently over the internet than irl .
 r/anime_irl says hi .
 i love john cena so i &apos;m going to take irrational offense to this as though you &apos;re attacking me .
 old reddit still exists and is perfectly usable ,  complete with custom css .
 what about the guy who had his face ripped off ?
  wasn’t expecting that at 7am in the morning .
 there &apos;s nothing wrong with john cena/potato salad .
 it/he goes good with everything !
 for sure ,  but (at least from stats on subreddits i run) ,  most people are visiting on mobile app and the redesign ,  so if that &apos;s true for those subreddits that make use of nsfl tags ,  it &apos;s not a consistent user experience (unless they &apos;re just making a post flair bigger ?
 i remember that .
 it was certainly a shocking photo .
 not sure what it has to do with me praising this guy’s wit ,  but go off i guess
 sorry if you didnt want this brought up ,  but can i have the link ?
 would it be based on their actual stance ,  or what they claim is their stance ?
 they &apos;d lie even more (to get elected) than they do now .
 you should look up the philosophical thought experiment called the veil of ignorance .
 it poses a similar question: you have to look at all political ,  economic ,  and social ideas without knowing what your socioeconomic position is .
 e: pasting the reply from u/ucantharmagoodwoman to give a more accurate description of the experiment ,  popularly attributed to american philosopher john rawls .
 you have to look at all that and then design a society that you would want to live in .
 but ,  the catch is ,  you don &apos;t know what your position will be .
 you might be at the bottom ,  you might be at the top .
 the idea is that you &apos;ll try to make the society as equitable as possible .
 (kind of like the kid who cuts the cake doesn &apos;t get to pick his slice .
 it should be like the blind auditions on the voice !
 the best bullshitter wins ,  not that that changes much ,  but without anything to hold them accountable to their statements and commitments its just a mess .
 how would you feel if r/askreddit banned leading questions that begin with “how would you feel” ?
 i mean for one ,  it isnt plausible .
 but also the ability to be social is important for a leader .
 i think we need to know more than just the policies .
 i want to know if they &apos;re just saying things for votes or if there &apos;s proof of them actually trying to do what they say .
 it &apos;s all very well saying war is bad ,  but are you actually protesting against wars ,  or just saying it &apos;s bad (as an example) .
 no ,  because things like leadership ability and integrity matter .
 lmao at all the supportive comments .
 it’s really one of the dumbest idea i’ve ever read about elections .
 you realize a person can lie about their stance right ?
 okay so now you have 400 candidates who all say their stance is whatever is highest polling ,  or a slight variation thereof .
 some might be true believers in those reforms but most just take those positions cynically to get elected .
 how can you tell who’s who ?
 anyone can fake a  &apos;stance &apos; .
 you need all of it to know if you are being lied to or not .
 and even then most people can &apos;t tell the difference .
 strongly dislike this idea .
 i view character and integrity as equally important to policy positions and without knowing anything else about the candidate ,  i cant evaluate these traits
 i &apos;d be happy if the early primaries simply involved a basic civics contests and the person who scores the lowest is automatically disqualified from running .
 no way that’s an awful idea .
 you need accountability and resumes .
 whoops voted for hitler
 we would be governed by ai
 in the uk during the time of the recent general election there was a site sort of like this principle that gave you the initiative to vote based upon policy rather than party .
 it was basically just a question on a certain issue such as climate change and then would show various options for solutions/ideas and by the end would show you the party who’s policy’s you sided with the most .
 a good idea in my opinion as many simply write off their preferred parties ‘rival’ without looking at the possible positives of their ideas and could also help those who are disengaged from politics due to the drama of it all to actually see the facts and see what they side with the most .
 trump would have won even harder .
 the only reason why some of his party dose not like him is because he &apos;s a dick .
 if this fact was hidden from them ,  all any one would see is  &apos;lower taxes ,  and increase border security .
  &apos;  those are both things that are very popular in america .
 nah ,  we need their name .
 what if a google search reveals they &apos;re a ventriloquist or taxidermist .
 can &apos;t have that .
 how do you verify which is which
 i don &apos;t trust anything most politicians say or write .
 half their  &apos;beliefs &apos; are just to toe the party line or get votes .
 i ,  bloomberg a  33 years old 6 &apos;4 240lbs blonde guy with blue eyes ,  six packs and mixed parents  would never do such a thing .
 an example of this in fiction is from the doctor who 50th anniversary special  &apos;day of the doctor &apos; in which two negotiators have their memories wiped .
 the theory being that they will negotiate a treaty that is fair to all parties ,  as each negotiator doesn &apos;t know which party they belong to .
 it sounds really interesting - i’ll check it out .
 there &apos;s a (probably) apocryphal story in the hs debate community i remember hearing back in the day:  .
 harvard was hosting a debate tournament and invited some of the professors to participate as guest judges .
 a round begins ,  and one of the debaters makes a veil of ignorance argument in favor of his position .
 the other debater responds by explaining all the flaws of the veil of ignorance and in any event asks why we should consider the issue on the basis of a second tier dead philosopher &apos;s theory .
 the judges then caucused and proceeded to provide their feedback .
  rawls (one of the judges) revealed that ,  though he may be a second tier philosopher ,  he is still very much alive (this was in the 80s or 90s) .
  everyone laughed uproariously ,  etc .
 does anyone else remember hearing this story ?
 we did a similar experiment while i was in highschool .
 our history teacher presented a description/set of values of multiple historical leaders .
 half the class voted for hitler .
 patriotic ,  veteran ,  vegetarian ,  dog person ,  for economic growth ,  charismatic ,  man of the people ect .
 of course the description were biased and didn &apos;t include the fucked shit .
 the again ,  when &apos;s the last time candidate said  &apos;i &apos;ll give taxe break to the rich and sabotage our relations with x country !
  &apos; while running for election ?
 to all the people quoting that last paragraph and replying  &apos;but but trump did it in 2016 !
 he was all about  &apos;helping the working class ,  pulling out of the middle east and cleaning up the swamp &apos; .
 i chose those two examples for a reason .
 a bit different ,  because you don &apos;t know your own position ,  while in op &apos;s scenario ,  you don &apos;t know the candidates &apos; .
 don &apos;t forget the rest of the thought experiment - you have to look at all that and then design a society that you would want to live in .
 but ,  the catch is ,  you don &apos;t know what your position will be .
 you might be at the bottom ,  you might be at the top .
 the idea is that you &apos;ll try to make the society as equitable as possible .
 (kind of like the kid who cuts the cake doesn &apos;t get to pick his slice .
 in a practical sense ,  i use this for when i make pies .
 the person cutting the slices cannot be the person who gives out the slices .
 it almost always ensures no unusually small or big slices .
 having posed this question ,   could we wind up voting for an a .
 i artificial intelligence ,   that would run the country for us based on its suggestions ?
 technically you would try to make the expectation of your utility as high as possible ,  not necessarily equitable .
 if you’ll have a very high chance of having a great middle class life ,  you might not mind the very small chance of suffering as a low class .
 i ran for municipal office a couple years ago (lost in a nail biter) .
 while running ,  a major political figure in town (former mayor and retired federal cabinet minister) invited me for coffee .
 this guy is as straight up ,  honest ,  and principled as they come .
 he liked me ,  my campaign ,  and wanted to offer some advice .
 the main takeaway he emphasized in our chat was this: .
  &apos;don &apos;t make promises or guarantees .
 don &apos;t say you are going to do anything .
 promise nothing but good representation .
 so many things are beyond to control of a single elected official .
 tell people what you believe and how you will represent them .
 if you offer promises ,  you &apos;re setting them up for disappointment and yourself up for failure .
 there’s also the question of competence .
 i’d rather have someone i 70% agree with who was competent than someone i 100% agree with who was utterly useless .
 the candidate &apos;s voting history should also be available .
 while that &apos;s true there is the issue of people favoring the more attractive candidate .
 one example is the 1960 presidential debate ,  the people who watched said jfk won while the people who listened favored nixon
 even better ,  make them wear costumes like the masked singer
 the masked president
 this is how i feel about debates .
 i ,  for one ,  would rather see long form interviews from the party candidates .
 seems that would be more informing .
 if you were offered $1 , 000 , 000 , 000 to not use reddit for a day ,  would you take it ?
 how would you feel if
 i seriously wonder how someone could read the title and think  &apos;yes ,  this is a great idea and would totally work out just fine .
 the kind of question that can only be hatched from the brain of an individual who thinks he acts exclusively on logic ,  reason ,  and facts ,  while everyone else is all about identity politics and emotion .
  &apos;if only i could force everyone to not see contextual details that are important to them ,  then i know they &apos;d vote for my favorite candidate .
 i legitimately think children make these ,  like kids just breaching the surface of 14 .
 this is such a “i’m sorting out my politics and am doing my best to think but have no real education in or experience with political theory , ” thing to do .
 like i get some adults are at that place on polit .
 philosophy anyway and that’s fine ,  nobody has to be an expert on anything ,  but i think most adults that are there think it contentedly to themselves .
 these questions always have such a juvenile confidence .
 with reddit answers .
  &apos;ah wahnt ai presidents &apos;
 was gonna say the same thing .
 it’s a stupid ass suggestion that would never actually work in real life ,  but hey at least it sounds good right ?
 i visibly cringed when i read the title .
 like what the fuck how reddit can you be ?
 i almost feel nostalgic for narwhal bacon bullshit .
 was almost a more  &apos;innocent &apos; type of cringe .
 “how would you feel if a naked man broke into your home” .
 immediately followed by 28 comment long chain that inevitably devolves back into us left vs right politics .
 i could’ve sworn they did .
 so stupid that these questions still get onto the front page
 7k hey reddit ,  how would you feel if ridiculous idea that only looks good as long as you put no thought into it were implemented ?
 the only way this would work is if it &apos;s a mind reading scenario .
 a president isn’t just a person whose views we support ,  it’s also their political talent .
 they have to interact with other leaders ,  stay calm under pressure ,  give good speeches ,  etc etc .
 because recent elections have proved the american electorate are an excellent judge of character .
 that subreddit is literally entirely a meme
 i believe that was a joke on political compass memes
 i just tried isidewith .
 it &apos;s fine ,  except it seemed to rank politicians based on their stated goals and not at all in their record .
 the problem with isidewith is it completely throws out any nuance at all .
 very broad and vague policy questions are  &apos;yes/no &apos;
 isidewith told me i backed trump ,  bloomberg ,  and delaney equally .
 how does that make any sense ?
 until that site tells me that there is a 1% difference between buttgeig and sanders
 interesting ,  isidewith just told me i was already backing the right candidate for me .
 i &apos;m not just looking at how they stand on some issue .
 that doesn &apos;t tell me how they will lead when unexpected situations arise and they are forced to make difficult decisions .
 they need to work with other foreign leaders ,  senators ,  their own cabinet ,  experts ,  etc .
 i want someone who is going to weigh all the information and make sound decisions that are in the best interest of the people of the united states .
 their story (philosophy ,  upbringing ,  triumphs ,  defeats) will all help guide what they believe to be in the best interests .
 and their persona will help them in generating cohesion to get anything of magnitude accomplished in today &apos;s political landscape .
 the more bizarre thing to me is that the president’s stances are among the least important things to being president .
 turns out that’s all anyone cares about ,  but what he thinks about gun control or abortion doesn’t even matter .
 his ability to facilitate government ,  lead the legislative branch to tackle and reach agreements/compromises to enact necessary policy on tough issues ,  represent america on a global stage ,  articulate issues to foreign leaders as well as the american people ,  and uphold the constitution and rule of law are all monumentally more important than whether he agrees with me on deficit spending .
 all those issues are how you’re supposed to elect congressmen and senators .
 they’re the ones who make the laws ,  not the president .
 you think obamacare would have happened with a republican legislature ?
 if we moved to what op proposes ,  we might elect the most reasonable ,  thoughtful ,  intelligent person ever who happens to be a 5’2” neckbeard with severe social anxiety who can’t be taken seriously as a professional ,  let alone the leader of a nation .
 i know this might sound crazy ,  because i see what you &apos;re saying and why ,  but i think that would actually be a terrible idea .
 first ,  you &apos;re assuming that the test can &apos;t/won &apos;t be rigged or manipulated in some way ,  and there &apos;s sufficient evidence that our electoral processes aren &apos;t as secure as we thought .
 second ,  barring out and out fraud ,  there &apos;s still opportunity for political manipulation in the test &apos;s formulation or administration .
 again ,  this requires good faith participation from all actors ,  which you plausibly won &apos;t have .
 next ,  let &apos;s say the test isn &apos;t out and out rigged ,  and is also fairly conceived and administered ,  what constitutes a  &apos;pass &apos; ?
 can you miss any questions ?
 are the test results made public ?
 even if you officially pass ,  does missing a particular question implicitly impugn a candidate &apos;s worthiness ?
 i don &apos;t think there are necessarily clear or correct answers to these questions ,  but there &apos;s a lot riding on getting them all right on the first try .
 and finally ,  do you really want a third party deciding on your behalf that your candidate is unfit and ineligible for office ?
 i get how in the best case scenario ,  that seems like a good thing ,  but it &apos;s also fundamentally undemocratic in a very deep ,  meaningful sense .
 broadly speaking ,  my view is that we should do the opposite ,  and have as few barriers as possible between the electorate and the candidate .
 there &apos;s a lot i would change about our political administrative processes ,  but the fact that basically anyone can run isn &apos;t one of them .
 how would you handle the contest ,  and how would you insure that it &apos;s not biased or gamed ?
 politicians spend millions of dollars on their political campaigns ,  you think no one could afford to pay a guy fifty bucks to bomb a civics test ?
 yeah ,  another problem with this .
  what you gonna do ?
  hook them up to a polygraph ?
 water board them .
 it’s a sure way to be sure that none of them are sean hannity .
 with candidates now ,  you can verify because we know who they are .
 seeing bernie getting arrested for protesting segregation in the 60 &apos;s (showing he probably actually is anti-racism) and has advocated for very similar things his entire career .
 knowing bloomberg is responsible for stop and frisk policies and he &apos;s now claiming to have a plan for criminal justice reform (which we can &apos;t necessarily trust because he &apos;s never shown to actually have changed his opinions) .
 checking biden &apos;s past votes and seeing he was criticized for not supporting anita hill in the early 90s but later writing the violence against women act (showing he may have grown to be more compassionate towards women ,  or at least thinks doing that is more politically beneficial) .
 if you don &apos;t know who nominees are ,  you can &apos;t see their past .
 if someone thinks saying  &apos;i support a woman &apos;s right to choose &apos; will get them elected ,  they can win on that promise and then immediately try to repeal roe v .
 wade upon inauguration day .
 someone could still bait and switch today ,  but at least we can see if their opinions happen to change just before campaign season or if they &apos;ve at least claimed to feel this way for a while .
 unless they &apos;ve been campaigning for the same issues for decades without changing their positions ,  of course .
 if someone dedicates their whole life to a series of issues ,  i &apos;m not going to accuse them of  &apos;believing &apos; something just to get votes .
 if they keep two thirds ,  it &apos;s a bit relevant which of their promises are the remaining third .
  &apos;i &apos;ll improve the stock market ,  keep us safe with investment into the military ,  and improve the lives of the average citizen .
 i may be cynical ,  but i think i can spot the two truths and the lie .
 i know this is just a joke but i &apos;m pretty sure you have to be at least 35 years old to run for president ,  which just makes the joke better .
 bloomberg creeps me the fuck out .
 i don &apos;t want trump ,  but i also don &apos;t want bloomberg .
 you could also have someone lying about being a self made millionaire ,  about being native american ,  about not being the zodiac killer .
 my name is mike bloomberg ,  and i am 33 years old .
 my house is in the northeast section of morioh ,  where the villas are .
 33 would disqualify him from the presidency .
 a beautiful example of political theory
 awesome speech and episode
 that reminds me of an old fable that i &apos;m going to paraphrase and butcher .
 two brothers are set to inherit land once their father dies .
 they can &apos;t decide how to equitably split the land .
 father tells them that one must draw the boundary ,  and the other gets to pick which portion he wants .
 so whoever draws the boundary wants to make it as fair as possible since he doesn &apos;t get to choose which portion he gets .
 one of my favorite episodes in doctor who .
 like the cake slicing thing .
 one person cuts the cake ,  and the other chooses which piece they want .
 by not knowing what piece you get ,  the slicer cuts the cake as fair as possible .
 scrolled down hoping to see this ,  thank you !
 which was cute ,  but the idea that the zygons wouldn &apos;t be able to tell that they &apos;re massive orange plunger monsters pretending to be humans was just silly ,  memory erasure or not .
 i miss moffat’s doctor who episodes .
 this requires an ability to read and reason ,  so that &apos;s going to be a no from me .
 i think if anything has been shown lately it is that  we greatly overestimate the capacity of the average human .
 i &apos;ve never heard that anecdote but as someone about to finish a degree in philosophy i can tell you that rawls is one of the most cited philosophers of the last century .
 it seems kind of awkward to call him second-tier .
 i know this doesn &apos;t really have bearing on the anecdote (other than being a criticism of the debater &apos;s claim) ,  but since rawls is completely unknown to a lot of people in this thread i thought this was a good place to wedge it in .
 i debated in the same league as ted cruz did (albeit like 30 years after) .
 harvard is in that same league and hosts tournaments that i’ve debated at .
 we sprinkled in veil of ignorance arguments all the time and regularly tore them apart if used against us as well .
 i’ve never heard of that particular story and the league has decent institutional memory (given we remembered ted cruz and could see he’d won tournaments and shit) .
 with how much we abused the veil of ignorance as an argument for stuff ,  i imagine a story about that would have been passed down .
 anyways ,  it’s not implausible .
 there’s always a panel of judges for outrounds (quarter-finals ,  semis and the final round) .
 we mostly used former league alumni (who would come for a free party) as judges for those big rounds .
 in the 80s-90s when modern debate style norms weren’t as codified and you didn’t need to be fucking trained on how to adjudicate a round ,  i could definitely see the university bringing in a panel of professors to judge a round .
 i didn’t really dip my toes much into the british parliamentary/international style that i know harvard is into as well and with how prestigious those tournaments get ,  i could definitely see the university having a panel of professors for a tournament that oxford and cambridge would have been at (in addition to the ivy league/northeast schools) .
 i think the classic example is this: .
 “candidate a: associates with ward healers and consults with astrologists; has had two mistresses; chain-smokes and drinks eight to ten martinis a day .
 “candidate b: was kicked out of office twice; sleeps until noon; used opium in college; drinks a quart of brandy every evening .
 “candidate c: is a decorated war hero ,  a vegetarian ,  doesn’t smoke ,  drinks an occasional beer ,  and has had no illicit love affairs .
 “which of these candidates is your choice ?
 you don’t really need any more information ,  do you ?
 candidate a is franklin roosevelt .
 candidate b is winston churchill .
 candidate c is adolf hitler .
 i did not write this ,  it &apos;s a thing they tell high schoolers to basically say it &apos;s dumb to vote based on these kinds of things .
 i &apos;m not trying to make any kind of statement with this lol .
 that feels a bit disingenuous and i &apos;m sure it was done as a bit of a  &apos;gotcha &apos; maneuver .
 did she exclude the whole  &apos;advocate for the genocide of an entire group of people ?
 that &apos;s like saying ,  would you bang a woman who finds you interesting ,  dotes on you ,  willing to cook for you ,  etc .
 ewww ,  you would bang your mom .
 it &apos;s not enough information to decide off of .
 you need to have a candidate be known and demonstrate their demeanor ,  competence ,  and charisma .
 same thing with interviews .
 a candidate may have the prettiest resume but when you bring them in and find out that they were really just resume building rather than developing themselves ,  most are shown the door .
 i &apos;m assuming leaving out the genocide part of his platform ?
 because that was in there from the start .
 that is incredibly disengenuous though
 the teacher didn &apos;t bother to include narcissistic ,  authoritarian and anti-semitic ?
 sounds like the experiment got exactly the result the teacher wanted ,  though perhaps not the most accurate .
 curious what you mean by “it never works” ?
 i’m honestly wondering ,  do you disagree with the results it tells you ?
 political compass quests ate often really biased and vague .
 yeah but then you get that one dick who will wager he &apos;ll be in a good spot .
 so he &apos;ll make a pretty unfair society and if he &apos;s at the top ,  he wins ,  and if he &apos;s at the bottom ,  oh well that &apos;s what you get for playing the game .
 so basically he wins either way .

 my dad was a councillor in a town of 10000 people and later a county of 40000 when it was amalgamated .
  he held office from 1980 to 2010 without ever losing .
 his secret; he told people the truth ,  admitted when he was wrong and did his best .
      in his first year in office he started pushing for a new community centre and it was finally  built in his last year in office .
  he didn &apos;t promise the 1980 voters a new centre ,  only that he would try to make it happen and 30 years later ,  they got it .
 did the retired mayor look like brian doyle murray ?
 when i read that story ,  i picture him looking like brian doyle murray .
 i think that sounds like a person who tries to behave ethically .
  i &apos;m surprised he got as far as he did with an honest platform .
 i agree with him ,  though it seems the way to win now is to promise everything for free and spread hate and misinformation .
  from both sides
 hey ,  thanks for making this comment and putting your experience out there .
 a true diamond in the rough .
 i think showing a track record of fighting for issues is important .
 i get the sentiment but it does not resonate with me .
 you don &apos;t have to promise me x policy because shits hard to pass .
 you do have to promise you &apos;ll fight for x policy or i &apos;m gonna go next on you next election cycle .
 and ,  maybe as part of competence ,  the ability to convince others is essential for a politician .
 so he believes the solution to issue a is the same i believe: can he talk others into seeing it that way too ?
 if ,  when trying to implement it ,  it turns out the best solution is somehow different (as the devil is always in the details): can he explain why in a way that &apos;s understandable ?
 without that ,  might as well have direct democracy instead of representation .
 very easy to say you &apos;re going to do something ,  much harder to navigate congress or aldermen or council members or what have you to actually get your agenda passed
 omg my doppelganger is a trump supporter .
 i hope nobody ever sees that photo and thinks it &apos;s me holding the  &apos;build &apos; sign .
 also the things they &apos;ve refused to bring to the table at all .
  those  &apos;most progressive/conservative candidate by voting record &apos; things never tell the whole story .
 if their voting history is available ,  it would &apos;t be too tough for the public to link it to identity .
 that example is pretty muddy ,  there were some confounding variables that make the conclusion less clear .

 the issue with just letting candidates talk is that it needs to be adversarial .
  all good politicians can spin a load of bullshit that sounds nice that the average voter isn &apos;t going to fully decipher .
 if politician a promises to get you a program with out comes you like ,  and promises that we can easily pay for it and implement it ,  most people are not equipped to challenge that assertion of  &apos;this will be easy and cheap &apos; .
   politician b is fully equipped and strongly incentivized to challenge the assertion ,  especially if it is untrue .
 an adversarial process is a good thing .
  i think that debates are good in that they provide a place where the politicians don &apos;t fully control their message and are up against people that disagree with them .
  i think that that is pretty important .
 i too would like a different debate format ,  but i would want to keep the adversarial nature .
  i want candidate a to explain why candidate b is wrong ,  not just hear candidate a tell me why they are right ,  and then hear candidate b tell me why they are right .
  the last thing i want to hear is an hour long campaign speech .
  i can hear that any time i want .
 i want their ideas attacked .
  their ideas need to be attacked .
  any debate format that doesn &apos;t keep that isn &apos;t worth it .
 luckily ,  we &apos;re getting more of that with podcasts .
 i &apos;d wager that just about every high-polling candidate (sans biden) has had a long-form podcast interview .
 the networks won &apos;t do it ,  but it &apos;s getting done .
 honestly i’d do it for $10 ,  anything to motivate me off this neurotic site .
 you can get money for not-using reddit ?
 someone owes me big for all the time before i knew the site existed
 god ,  my brain just died some from reading those .
 what if you had to pass an iq test in order to vote
 i thought we &apos;d all agreed to ban these kinds of posts
 this shit really does need to stop on here
 wasn &apos;t long ago that was a tumblr thing and we all made fun of them .
 ok but hoooow would you feel if presidents had to kiss keannu reeves and praise baby yoda ?
 i thought we banned these questions !
 yeah i cant believe anyone would think thats actually a good idea .
 it &apos;s one thing to agree with a persons policy ,  but if that person turned out to be a rapist or a murder (which would be excluded from this) then there would definitely a problem .
 policy is one thing ,  being able to judge one on their previous actions and behaviors is another .
 maybe they’re a 12 year old kid with a set of policies their teacher wrote out for them who thinks they stand a chance .
 even if someone does ,  it adds absolutely nothing .
 this sub is supposed to open up discussion .
 a resume crosses your desk with their work history ,  do you hire someone based on that alone without even meeting them ?
  i agree the idea is silly .
 came here to say this .
 and i am embarrassed to say i recognized 21 y/o me in this question .
 being 20 years older now ,  although i am a progressive and an atheist ,  it is absolutely astounding to me that anyone would think a good idea to elect the leader of a people without knowing their religious beliefs or lack thereof .
 and this is precisely the kind of dumb shit that 21 y/o used to think ( &apos;religion should have nothing to do with politics !
 it arises from a conception of politics as a cerebral ,  technocratic exercise exclusively focused on rationat solutions and free from emotions .
 in reality ,  when people elect a president ,  they aren &apos;t just looking for the best policy to make a better country or world as they see it .
 they are choosing a leader ,  someone who embodies the best version of themselves and their nation ,  an inspirational and aspirational ideal .
  like ,  i get it ,   &apos;the world would be so much better if everyone could just see through the bullshit ,  like i do &apos; is an important stage in the development of esp .

 it &apos;s so annoying .
 sometimes i just want to read some quality answers to quality questions but i can &apos;t because all of the top posts are like  &apos;how would you feel if i killed you right now &apos; or some other shit were literally anyone reasonable would have the exact same answer as anyone else
 exactly ,  it bothers me when people act like policies are the only thing that matters when it comes to these things .
 like ,  are you really gonna tell me the only important differences between trump and obama are their differing opinions on taxation ,  gun control ,  and a couple other policies ,  and their differences in personality and methods of discourse are completely irrelevant ?
 the real world isn’t ,  which is what he’s alluding to by referencing that subreddit .
 my experience in the last few elections is that it &apos;s based off their policy planks rather than record .
 which just goes to show that op &apos;s original idea is problematic because it lacks context .
 you have to expand the answer options for each question for a more accurate reading .
 this is the perfect answer .
 we &apos;d have a new app that was made by a company that recieved funding from a current candidate ,  ran by previous employees of a failed candidate ,  and tell the old ladies not to worry about counting ,  the ipad &apos;s will do all the math .
 it &apos;ll totally work .
 what about someone who’s never held office before
 then we would know who the candidate was based on process of elimination .
 ahh imagine a world were people looked at voting history .
 we might not be as fucked as we currently are .
 wouldn &apos;t it be pretty easy to figure out who nominees are based on their voting history ?
 you would identify the state immediately ,  as well as when they first started voting ,  and then it &apos;s just a matter of process of elimination - even easier if you can see what bills they sponsored or explanations of their votes ,  which can often provide helpful context .
 plus this is a lot easier for congresspeople and a alot harder for executives - governors don &apos;t make the same sort of votes as delegates or senators ,  for instance ,  but their experience is more directly to that of a president .
 people change their minds on issues over time
 problem with this is sometimes a lawmaker will slip in additional riders to a proposed bill that ,  if passed ,  would be bad .
 so a popular bill (progressive taxes !
 ) might get shot down by its own party because something arbitrarily terrible would be passed with it (set fire to all planned parenthood locations !
 then later ,  an opponent can say  &apos;you voted against \popular thing\ !
 trying to sort through the context of anyone &apos;s voting history in this scenario would be no different from now .
 yeah ,  you &apos;d also need to see how strongly they hold the position too .
 it &apos;s one thing to be in favor of say ,  lower interest rates on capital gains ,  but if they &apos;re willing to sacrifice those lower interest rates in the name of a trade to get more support for climate refugees ,  then we &apos;d need to know that .
 politics is not so much about ideals ,  but rather compromise and horse-trading .
 no politician is going to state where they &apos;ll compromise .
 that &apos;s a losing strategy .
 how do you sort out sicophants that believe their own garbage ?
 to get government security clearence you sometimes have to take a polygraph is it too much of a stretch to apply that to the presidency .
 why not ,  though polygraphs can be fallible just like the promises of politicians .
 there are patterns here .
 you might as well save your time and write  &apos;vote for bernie &apos; .
 especially when those issues were wildly unpopular at the time .
 hell yeah bloomberg is out i’m 100% good with this system .

 then the vice  president elect shall act as president until a president shall have qualified .
 i actually meant 35 haha !
 it’s hard to type on this old phone i’m on ,  i ,  mike bloomberg ,  am from a working class background where money is tough to come by ,  so i can relate to you people !
 i love that bloomberg &apos;s platform seems to be ,   &apos;hey ,  if you loved having an out-of-touch billionaire new yorker with no real loyalties and no shame about buying a presidency ,  wait &apos;ll you get a load of me !
 that &apos;s a common sentiment and he knows it .
 you &apos;ll notice his ads contain almost no video clips of him .
  &apos;there &apos;s one in the spotlight ,  he don &apos;t look right to me .
 get him up against the wall (and frisk him) &apos; - bloomberg probably .
 liberals tend to want to scapegoat middle america for america &apos;s proud ignorance but ,  all the toxic volatility we &apos;ve seen in politics recently have been sourced directly out of nyc and dc .
 this is the culture neoliberal plutocrats are breeding .
 it &apos;s like sharing things between toddlers .
 two cups of juice ?
 tell one to pour the juice and the other gets to choose their cup .
 theory is right .
 i actually had a similar idea in college in political theory class .
  this could work but it runs into a fatal flaw when it comes to campaigning and funding .
 i still think about how to work it sometimes .
  what about criminal background and education ?
  i do see the good it would do though .
 also a great example of peter capaldi being a magnificent bastard .
 you are thinking of a later episode that continues the story from the 50th anniversary ,  the zygon inversion .
 agreed it is a great speech and episode ,  but that &apos;s not the 50th .
 what’s the speech ?
 i youtube’d the episode ,  but no clips stood out as “the speech” (from someone who doesn’t watch doctor who) .
 it &apos;s a must see show for people who haven &apos;t seen it .
 make it the next one you binge .
 this is also the best way to split food (or almost anything) between two people
 honestly i completely forgot about this episode .
 i didn &apos;t like the doctor as i found him very hard to relate to after the last doctor &apos;s .
 i felt like he had no empathy at all ,  until i realized why he had isolated himself and became that way .
 this episode completely blew under the radar but after rewatching that speech i am reconsidering watching his seasons again .
 also probably gonna get  &apos;the only way to live in peace is to forgive .
 break the cycle  &apos; because i have never heard a more powerful sentence .
  if i do that with my wife ,  i &apos;ll try to be generous ,  thinking she &apos;ll choose the bigger half .
 then she goes and takes the smaller one !
 that &apos;s why you cut it smaller on top to one side ,  then angle it halfway down so the smaller side digs into the other half .
 also the part where the guy was about to drone strike a spot full of shapeshifters and then oh weird it &apos;s his wife and kids waving to the camera must be them call off the strike ,  episode lost me then .
 i miss his standalone episodes .
 if he has a whole season to work with ,  it just doesn &apos;t have as much of an impact .
 just my opinion though .
 his standalone episodes were great
 i think we underestimate the capacity of the average human by not engaging them properly .
 it &apos;s not easy when most people switch off when you mention politics though
 well speak for yourself ,  i get all my facts straight from the source: the memes .
 we don’t overestimate the capacity of an average human ,  but we grossly overestimated their conviction and willingness to do certain things .
 like read and reason ,  and act on it after .
 i dont think that we so much overestimate the capacity as we do the education and knowledge of the average person .
 i know a lot of people whose actions day to day do not seem to match their idealogical political beliefs at all .
 well ,  it &apos;s high school debate .
 the kid probably thought rawls was some 19th century philosopher .
 regularly tore them apart if used against us as well .
 are there general flaws with the veil of ignorance argument ?
 or did the specific arguments used against you contain poor logic ?
 but that &apos;s just selective use of information ,  it &apos;s pretty useless as a comparison to op &apos;s idea .
 you can make any historical person look good or bad by omitting certain facts about them .
 from a political standpoint that &apos;s pretty disingenuous ,  though .
 you &apos;ve absolutely left off plenty of necessary information for a political candidate .
 we need to know their stances on as many political topics as possible .
 how they &apos;ve voted ,  what they &apos;ve said ,  what they are now assuring us will be their future stance ,  and how long since they changed stance if a change has occurred plus any reason for the change .
 “which of these candidates is your choice ?
 you don’t really need any more information ,  do you ?
 honestly yeah i do .
 not voting for anyone without knowing what policies he claims to support and how efficient he was in the past to enact those policies .
 those are the only two things i care about .
 this thread makes me worried ,  are we at least a dozen to think like this ?
 hitler definitely had illicit love affairs ,  including one with his underage niece geli which ended with her suicide in (or possibly murder ,  depending on who you ask) .
 the excellent podcast behind the bastards did a 2 part episode about hitler &apos;s sex life a while back where they went through the myths and the more verifiable stuff ,  and it &apos;s about as weird and awful as one would expect from hitler .
 i think the point is that &apos;s the problem with this system it can be twisted in someone &apos;s favor
 did the people voting for hitler know he was going to commit genocide ?
 i mean i can  &apos;advocate for economic growth &apos; but the key is how i plan on doing that .
 in fact i don &apos;t think it ever was a public policy ,  beyond  &apos;separating the jews from the population &apos; .
 however his hatred and scapegoating of the jewish people definitely was always there .
 it &apos;s like a universal rule that if you live by the guillotine ,  you die by it .
 ah ,  the famous hacker 4chan
 you can do that at a local level ,  because a lot of people know you and know of you .
  honesty is probably more effective in a local election ,  at least for long-term viability .
 that community centre is a perfect example of having the right principles and mindset yet not being able to accomplish the objective for a long ,  long time ,  and i’ll bet that’s due to other political pressures that your dad had difficulty overcoming for many years .
 your dad had the right idea .
 promise to work hard and do your best ,  own your mistakes and don &apos;t bullshit .
 the system needs more people like him .
 he does a little .
 a tad more polished ,  more hair and less moustache ,  but the overall look is there .
 i think that sounds like a person who tries to behave ethically .
 thats a very optimistic outlook ,  a pessimist would just see it as covering there ass or even imply that they will do things they have no intention of touching
 that’s not “the way to win now” .
  it’s been that way for decades ,  if not more than a century .
  it’s not anything new .
  getting elected to the u .
 house of representatives earns that person a federal pension and the right to participate in the federal healthcare plan (not medicare ,  but a whole lot better) simply by serving one two-year term ,  and that’s just the tip of the iceberg .
  they have all the incentive in the world to lie ,  cheat or do whatever it takes to get elected .
  until things like that change ,  we’re gonna continue to see the same shit in every election .
 he advised me to make a list ,  be it 10 items or 1000 ,  of everything i believe in .
 then read it over and over again ,  memorize it .
 if asked a question ,  answer with the appropriate list item .
 run on yourself: your beliefs and principles ,  rather than promises .
 that &apos;s pretty much what he told me .
 as i mentioned in other comments: .
 he advised me to make a list ,  be it 10 items or 1000 ,  of everything i believe in .
 then read it over and over again ,  memorize it .
 if asked a question ,  answer with the appropriate list item .

 not to mention how insanely easy it is to make your record look like whatever you want it to look like .
 it &apos;s really easy to soften your image or appear bipartisan by just voting however you want when you know you &apos;re not going to be the swing vote .
 had to award you
 start your engines !
 all the debates are moderated by nick cannon .
 just make debates 6 hours long amd have experts from different fields and political views ask questions and confront them with facts ,  also have a live checking team that can look up what they are talking about and confront them if they say blatantly false things .
 candidates can answer proberly and will be fact checked in order to not enable them to misinform the public as the current president does in every speech of his .
 also having moderators that are worth a damn .
 cnn has had some of the worst debate questions .
 it &apos;s clear that they like some candidates over others .
 you can also do it for free .
 see you all again in a few days
 i &apos;d do it for a chocolate bar .
 should old people be allowed to drive ,  or should we feed them to the meat grinder ?
 gamers of reddit how would you feel if you had to pass an iq test to get a girlfriend ?
 i legit hate the iq test questions because that is already a flawed system that doesn &apos;t reflect intelligence and voting is a human right .
 even if it &apos;s a dumbass ,  that dumbass gets to choose .
 also the people that make these questions assume they already aren &apos;t a dumbass
 what if you had to pass an iq test in order to run for office ?
 then all of a sudden they &apos;d find a way to artificially reduce the reported iq of most minority groups .
 how would you feel if we banned these kinds of posts ?
 they &apos;re against the rules of /r/askreddit (questions must be open-ended) ,  but the mods don &apos;t seem to remove them .
 that &apos;s wholesome 100 !
 keanu chungus 100 .
 carefully ,  he &apos;s a hero !
 and what if the president had to say minecraft good and fortnite bad ?
 and even if you only knew a candidates polices ,  it should still be a pretty clear indicator of what party they are a part of .
 oh this candidate supports gun control ,  abortion ,  and medicare for all ?
 well gee wiz its a real head scratcher about what party this candidate could belong to .
 allowing politicians to lie/hide with zero accountability for their record is just dangerous .
 this scary scenario is actually pretty much what we are witnessing play out on corporate media echo chambers today with republicans pretending to be democrats and lying with zero pushback .
 just one major example why giving bad faith actors more weapons to deceive is a slippery slope .
 but i &apos;ll concede with a few modifications ,  it would be an interesting experiment .
 nothing but data on current policy positions ,  past decisions ,  past personal history ,  and information like donors .
 you can &apos;t make an informed decision without that type of info .
 most polling proves wrong the gaslighting that convinced americans they aren &apos;t progressive ,  but when they are asked about the issues ,  individually one by one ,  down the line ,  americans are overwhelmingly progressive .
 it &apos;s just when you put a name ,  face ,  and toxic (d) on any policy that clouds people &apos;s judgement due to current propaganda .
 op just wants to be told their idea is good
 if any sub has no need to get on the front page it’s askreddit
 i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;d still like sanders .
 every now and then his frustration with right wingers and bullshit more generally breaks through and he vents that anger .
 i bet unfiltered bernie would be a fucking riot in the best way possible .
 reddit is full of people who would like to think social skills and presentation aren &apos;t that important .
 probably their prom king and queen votes
 that would still be their voting history
 if we can reduce the uncertainty to just that situation ,  we &apos;d be doing good .
  it would also generate a lot of incentive for such not to want to give up their scruples so easily if people actually paid attention to them .
 it would be insane to elect someone with no political experience as president oh wait oh shit oh fuck
 then i don &apos;t know why the hell a person like that would think they could be president .
 voting history can be misleading .
  for example ,  democrats were attacked for voting against chip (children’s health insurance program) funding .
 however ,  the only reason democrats voted against it was because it was only a temporary extension and was attached to a larger funding bill that included trump’s border wall .
  they didn’t want to support the wall without protections for daca recipients .
 democrats were actually pushing for permanent chip funding as a stand alone bill .
 i would settle for a world where most people were actually seeking out factual information on the individuals/decisions they voted for - prior to casting said vote .
 i am going to be voting for the first time in the next election .
 any tips for finding what i need to be an informed voter ?
 i mean this is the future of my country we are talking about .
 but isn &apos;t that a bit of the point ?
 that you have to investigate the candidates fairly thoroughly before voting .
 and figuring out whos who will necessate that .
 maybe you can have a blurb to explain your voting history ?
 you don &apos;t want flipfloppers who switch position depending on who is in the room ,  but if you make a switch as in consistently anti- something ,  but then change to being consistently pro- something at a point in your life ,  you can explain why you switched and how you &apos;re committed to the new position .
 first step ,  get rid of the lead in the water and put some decent money back into education .
 or anyone else with integrity .
 which would be .
 no wait ,  give me a minute .
 not me ,  there &apos;s this young kid named ben wyatt and he promised us a winter sports complex named ice town .
 but bloomberg is different ,  he has a d next to his name which means something .
 bloomberg is not running to beat trump or provide an alternative to republicanism .
 bloomberg is running to beat bernie ,  and prevent the downfall of the oligarchy/plutocracy/kleptocracy that bernie represents .
 but they do contain audio clips of obama speaking .
 which i thought was pretty odd .
 it &apos;s almost as if it &apos;s an effort to say  &apos;you should vote for me because obama referenced me in a speech years ago .
 i &apos;m 33 and this is still how i split things up .
 last slice of pizza ?
 one person splits ,  the other person picks .
 edit  pork steak is a st .
 somebody will probably correct me ,  but it &apos;s basically a steak of pork butt (shoulder) that is usually grilled or smoked ,  sauce is optional .
 i &apos;ve personally bought ones as big as a pound and a half ,  but that &apos;s not the standard .
 they are every bit as delicious as you &apos;re imagining .
 when i was a kid we used to this for cokes .
 smart little shit that i was ,  i filled a glass of coke just a hair higher by using worschester sauce in it .
 my brother then gets to pick the glass ,  sees that it’s higher ,  and delightedly takes the first sip while crowing over this coup .
 five seconds in he screams loud enough that i’m grounded before i ever tasted the soda .
 years later ,  it was his turn to make sandwiches .
 he decided to put lemonade powder on the ham ,  swiss ,  and mayo sandwich .
 anyway ,  what i’m trying to say is that this rule doesn’t hold up when one side is willing to cheat .
 i was an absolute little shit with this .
 with food ,  i would cut it in weird zig zags that made it difficult to tell which piece had more (at least for small children) .
 i didn’t care who got the bigger piece ,  i just liked watching my step sister squirm and get upset that she couldn’t figure out which was bigger .
 for drinks i would use one wide but short cup and one tall but skinny cup .
 i would count in my head how long i was pouring for so i knew which had more (i think i usually made them about even though) ,  and again i would watch my sister squirm while she tried figuring out which had more .
 this is also why the dealer doesn’t cut the deck
  &apos;but i wanted that one .
 you only chose it brcause ot was biggerrrr &apos;
 make it state funded so every candidate has the same financial backing .
 and no campaigning just broadcast and display every manifesto the same amount (or at the same place) .
 criminal background checks could be done after the vote (no use running for office if you know you get disqualified) .
 the only thing i don &apos;t see a path around is how you would know or decide which candidate you think if fit for office .
 my understanding is that outside the us many countries have government funds for people running for office and all the candidates get some funding ?
 people can feel free to elaborate i don &apos;t know specifics .
 anyways ,  just legislate campaign funds and pay of the process to qualify are the background checks and tax audits you &apos;d expect of someone receiving a loan .
 he’s got layers !
 that initially confused me .
 the speech is actually a later episode that carries the story on from this one .
 it works for splitting a continuous quantity of an indistinguishable thing: there is no obvious difference between two halves of a slice of cake ,  and we can split it as finely as necessary .
 but to divide discrete objects ,  or quantities of objects where the participants &apos; preferences vary ,  it &apos;s not ideal .
 the problem with discrete objects is more obvious: if you and i are asked to split 3 opera tickets ,  i &apos;d rather be the one choosing than the one splitting !
 the most even trade you can offer is 2:1 ,  and i &apos;ll happily take the 2 .
 throwing away the spare ticket achieves fairness ,  but is wasteful .
 different preferences can make a difference even when we don &apos;t need to split an indivisible object .
 suppose i prefer apples to oranges ,  and you prefer oranges to apples ,  and we have 4 of each to split .
 if i have to offer a split ,  and i don &apos;t know that you prefer oranges ,  i would split into two piles ,  each with two apples and two oranges .
 that looks fair to you ,  so you pick one pile arbitrarily ,  and we &apos;re both moderately satisfied .
 but if we could negotiate more ,  we could reach a trade that leaves both of us happier: i &apos;ll take all the apples ,  and you can have all the gross oranges your heart desires .
 that &apos;s love dude .
 a lot of moffat episodes have some neat ideas surrounded by a lot of really ,  really dumb ideas .
 was that the 50(th) ?
 didn &apos;t that end with the doctor  !
 killing all the daleks by teleporting the planet away so that they all shot each other through where the planet used to be ,  because apparently they were all in perfectly-symmetrical orbits with each other !
 it &apos;s crazy how fast conversations can go south too .
  &apos;well the thing is ,  _________ worked to move such and such through to help the middle class &apos; .
  &apos;no ,  that &apos;s not true &apos; .
  &apos;uh ,  i mean it is &apos; .
  &apos;nope ,  not true .
 that did happen ,  but if you look at the reasons ,  they were forced to ,  so it wasn &apos;t something ________ pushed through &apos; .
  &apos;i read something different &apos; .
 okay fuck you then &apos;
 i think you underestimate how significant tribalism and clan mentality has on the human psyche .
 people wouldn &apos;t switch off if the news didn &apos;t always frame it up as retarded republican vs dumbshit democrat
 i think we underestimate the capacity of the average human by not engaging them properly .
 i think that &apos;s just more wishful thinking .
 honestly ,  i don &apos;t think most people want to have to care about national level politics and global issues ,  because it &apos;s outside the scope of anything we humans ever evolved to deal with ,  so i don &apos;t blame them .
 and yet we &apos;ve created a system that gives people the benefit of the doubt and takes them at their word while forcing them to make decisions far outside what they could be expected to adequately understand .
 it &apos;s no wonder at all that those who are least equipped to grasp the complex issues will simply default to loyalty to their tribe (political party) and just stop trying to understand them on their own .
 that &apos;s not saying they are stupid .
 they are actually doing their best to cope with what &apos;s being forced on them using the tools at their disposal .
 unfortunately those people are extremely susceptible to manipulation through fear and misinformation ,  as well as through the call to tribal (ideological) loyalty .
 it &apos;s only when those people are truly distressed and suffering in a material way that the opportunity opens up to introduce an alternate ideology .
 even then ,  some will happily continue to suffer ,  reassured by the knowledge that they &apos;re loyal .
 i used rawls a lot in high school debate and i swear people would act like he was from the 1800s .
 he died in 2002 people .
 i had written 2007
 fortunately ,  selective use of information would never be used for candidates in elections ,  so we’ve got that going for us .
 sure ,  but if you anonymize the information how do you still allow room for people to sniff out who &apos;s overstating their support for an issue ?
 look at the first dem debates vs the most recent .
 in the first ,  everyone was for m4a ,  in the recent ones it &apos;s basically only sanders and sort of warren .
 from a political standpoint that &apos;s pretty disingenuous ,  .
 much of politics is just that .
 we need to know their stances on as many political topics as possible .
 how they &apos;ve voted ,  what they &apos;ve said ,  what they are now assuring us will be their future stance .
 might as well just let them speak at that point .
 how are you going to have an anonymous system where people &apos;s voting records and past statements are on public display ?
 welcome to thought experiments .
  the point is to show what that looks like from a different bias .
 it’s weird ,  in some ways it seems easier to lie to people now ,  but when you look at all the places you can get information now ,  and how quickly we can validate information now ,  it should be harder right ?
 like spinning issues should be way harder now ,  but for some reason it feels it’s worse than ever .
 i wonder if the choice in where to get information has allowed us to sequester ourselves in what we want to hear/echo chamber .
 yea i don &apos;t think he ran on that platform
 doesn &apos;t mein kampf advocate for lebensraum and genocide ?
 eh ,  i dunno about jewish people specifically but before hitler even came into power the nazis had posters saying we should euthanize disabled people/cripples/ &apos;degenerates &apos; (lgbt people) .
 so maybe not genocide ,  just sheer racism at first (i dunno) ,  but definitely advocating for mass murder .
 the 90s recession killed it for a while ,  and then they had to catch up on vital infrastructure that got put off .
   he started again around 2000 .
 the problem is the system doesn’t work like that ,  candidates rely on emotions and combine that with entertainment news (both sides in the united states) that prioritizes the story over the facts and it’s no wonder the controversial candidates win .
 perhaps ,  but it’s hard to win over voters without promising things .
  you have to really believe your integrity is that appealing ,  it’s a hard sell .
 a pessimist would just see it as covering there ass or even imply that they will do things they have no intention of touching  .
 well ,  making promises they can &apos;t keep hasn &apos;t stopped anyone from being elected before ,  so that seems doubtful .
 telling people what they want to hear is the easiest job in the world .
 promising them things that you have no idea or plan on delivering is much easier than delivering hard truths .
 managing expectations and explaining reality to people is not  &apos;covering your ass &apos; ,  it &apos;s delivering unwelcome news and is very often punished .
 literally word for word from a gabriel iglesias standup .
 blind dates ,  candidates edition
 tell my brain that ,  please .
 i &apos;ve got things to be doing .
 instead i &apos;m getting worked up over political theory and the shitshow that is us politics ,  where i don &apos;t even live .
 oh god that first one .
 i don &apos;t like gendered bathrooms but sorting by pee and poop would almost be worse .
 i don &apos;t need everyone to know what the fuck i &apos;m doing in there .
 can we just make all bathrooms unisex without any other bullshit please ?
 if you had the choice between being the top scientist in your field ,  or getting mad cow disease ,  what would it be ?
 epic idea ,  that &apos;s so wholesome !
 keanu approves :)
 the sad part is this same joke gets made every time .
 these posts are that repetitive .
 wait ,  those are real ?
  they are not just a tv trope ?
 who did they vote for on american idol
 god ,  i cant believe that bernie voted for stephanie and brad for prom king and queen ,  we all know that jamie and cooper should &apos;ve won
 ya see its funny cuz our president doesnt have 5 years experience
 imagine you’re looking at bernie sanders voting record ,  and you scroll all the way back .
 and there right at the bottom .
 you agree with everything he voted for ,  every bill he proposed .
 he fucking voted for jerry for prom king ?
 jerry fucking leinham ?
 he was a prick .
 i’ll stick with trump .
 i &apos;m going to need you to explain how you get past votes being anonymous .
 think about all the people that would vote for actually good things only for a chance to be president .
 not exactly ,  if people are more likely to research the candidate they &apos;re voting ,  it was probably the intended goal in the first place .
 to have more knowledgeable voters .
 i don &apos;t get how you can just combine completely unrelated issues in one bill and have people vote on it .
 yeah passing laws is a cluster fuck and both parties try to slip things in on the other ,  every bill voted on is a landmine of potential problems ,  definitely do not the envy the people actually trying to do good in congress
 everyone will tell you not to party-line vote .
 and that sounds real astute ,  on paper .
 but bet on one thing: the candidate will vote purely party line ,  when elected .
 thats what they do ,  its why they &apos;re there .
 if one ,  for some reason ,  doesn &apos;t .
 that &apos;s newsworthy ,  because it happens so little .
 just a thing to keep in mind .
 also ,  one other little piece of wisdom for you .
 and that is ,  no matter who is president ,  whats going to make more actual difference in your life is voting locally .
 find out who your school board is .
 vote on the things where you actually live ,  not just once every 4 years in the big show .
 it matters more .
 someone would just create a website and publish the names so that you actually wouldn &apos;t have to figure out anything for yourself .
 instead of a blurb maybe they can actually meet people and talk to them  they can travel all over  the country to meet with people ,  maybe even take ads on newspapers and television to tell more people about themselves !
 i work in government and 99/100 someone votes for or against something based on the other attached aspects or wanting other attached aspects .
 some very simple topics were voted down dozens of times based on debate over the punishment .
 all to make sure punishment could be enforced .
 so it would show like voted against say  &apos;gun laws &apos; 20 times .
 but not because they were against gun laws ,  but that they wanted harsher punishments .
 so even though the number says the voted against it ,  they actually wanted a more hardcore version .
 and that is a simple reason why vote history is useless without extreme levels of context .
 you don &apos;t want flipfloppers who switch position .
 it &apos;s incredible how that phrase has become part of the culture war lexicon .
 it was originally ,  and effectively ,  used by republicans to destroy john kerry &apos;s candidacy ,  by suggesting that it was somehow wrong of him to learn and evolve as a person ,  and now it &apos;s become like a real purity test for both culture war teams .
 i cannot believe how fucking stupid this country has become .
  i really can &apos;t even begin to wrap my head around it .
 mccain the senator wasn &apos;t terrible ,  but his presidential campaign was all about appealing to the voters he wanted to court .
 his voting record and campaign platform were at nearly complete odds .
 this was before trump where i might &apos;ve disliked the opposite party but i didn &apos;t outright loathe them .
 so liked to see what they had to say and where they came from .
 get the hell outta here ice clown !
 but bloomberg told me he &apos;ll get it done
 i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve seen much support for bloomberg ,  from liberals .
 the world government in one piece better watch out
 bloomberg is 100% more scared of bernie than he ever will be of trump
 you cut i choose is a sacred rule
 how my wife and i split things as well .
 i do this too ,  i believe my entire family does .
 i &apos;ve never even considered this as an actual decision .
 it &apos;s just the way it &apos;s always worked .
 it’s always better to be the picker through .
 my brother and i would split a pizza between the two of us ,  and would fight over who got to pick first ,  so ,  my dad said “whoever picks first picks one slice ,  then whoever goes second picks two ,  then two then one” so basically picking first meant you got whichever you wanted ,  but going second meant you got second and third best pieces .
 so each choice had its own advantage .
 never fought over first pick again
 ah ,  political theory
 brothers gonna brother .
 my sons are absolutely great kids with the one exception of how they’re gonna fuck with their brother .
   that’s when the true evil comes out .
 being a convicted criminal doesn’t disqualify you from public office .
 there have been legislators in the past that were actively serving time in prison at the time of their election .
 up here in canada ,  thats only in my province ,  but 1 vote = 10$ for the party you voted for .
 personal contribution are limited to 100$ per year .
 (if you didn &apos;t voted ,  your part is shared so it &apos;s more 14-16$ per vote .
 the us has systems for candidates to get public funds in exchange for foregoing private funds ,  but you can get more money taking donations and it’s either-or ,  so very few candidates use it .
 also it was found unconstitutional recently in many states because of the limits on taking private donations ,  and taxpayers don’t like having to pay for candidates they don’t support .
 tl:dr it’s a bad idea .
 i &apos;ve never seen dr .
 who before ,  every second of that speech kept my eyes glued to the screen ,  that was so compelling ,  and the actor playing the doctor did such an amazing job here ,  wow .
 thanks for sharing that .
 or if you don’t want to watch it .
 (i would link the post i got this off but idk how) .
 the zygon inversion - a transcript of the doctor &apos;s speech .
 i &apos;ve produced a basic transcript of the doctor &apos;s speech at the end of last night &apos;s episode ,  the zygon inversion .
 you just want cruelty to beget cruelty .
 you &apos;re not superior to people who were cruel to you .
 you &apos;re just a whole bunch of new cruel people .
 a whole bunch of new cruel people ,  being cruel to some other people ,  who &apos;ll end up being cruel to you .
 the only way anyone can live in peace is if they &apos;re prepared to forgive .
 why don &apos;t you break the cycle ?
 bonnie: why should we ?
 the doctor: what is it that you actually want ?
 and when this war is over ,  when -- when you have the homeland free from humans ,  what do you think it &apos;s going to be like ?
 have you thought about it ?
 have you given it any consideration ?
 because you &apos;re very close to getting what you want .
 what &apos;s it going to be like ?
 paint me a picture .
 are you going to live in houses ?
 do you want people to go to work ?
 what &apos;ll be holidays ?
 will there be music ?
 do you think people will be allowed to play violins ?
 who will make the violins ?
 oh ,  you don &apos;t actually know ,  do you ?
 because ,  just like every other tantruming child in history ,  bonnie ,  you don &apos;t actually know what you want .
 so ,  let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours .
 when you &apos;ve killed all the bad guys ,  and it &apos;s all perfect and just and fair ,  when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it ,  what are you going to do with the people like you ?
 how are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one ?
 bonnie: we &apos;ll win .
 doctor: oh ,  will you ?
 well maybe -- maybe you will win .
 but nobody wins for long .
 the wheel just keepts turning .
 break the cycle .
 bonnie: then why are you still talking ?
 the doctor: because i &apos;m trying to get you to see .
 and i &apos;m almost there .
 bonnie: do you know what i see ,  doctor ?
 a box with everything i need .
 kate: for us ,  too .
 the doctor sighs .
 the doctor: and we &apos;re off !
 fingers on buzzers !
 are you feeling lucky ?
 are you ready to play the game ?
 who &apos;s going to be quickest ?
 who &apos;s going to be the luckiest ?
 kate: this is not a game !
 the doctor: no ,  it &apos;s not a game ,  sweetheart ,  and i mean that most sincerely .
 bonnie: why are you doing this ?
 kate: yes ,  i &apos;d like to know that too .
 you set this up -- why ?
 the doctor: because it &apos;s not a game ,  kate .
 this is a scale model of war .
 every war ever fought right there in front of you .
 because it &apos;s always the same .
 when you fire that first shot ,  no matter how right you feel ,  you have no idea who &apos;s going to die .
 you don &apos;t know who &apos;s children are going to scream and burn .
 how many hearts will be broken !
 how many lives shattered !
 how much blood will spill until everybody does what they &apos;re always going to have to do from the very beginning -- sit down and talk !
 listen to me ,  listen .
 i just -- i just want you to think .
 do you know what thinking is ?
 it &apos;s just a fancy word for changing your mind .
 bonnie: i will not change my mind .
 the doctor: then you will die stupid .
 alternatively ,  you could step away from that box .
 you could walk right out of that door ,  and you could stand your revolution down .
 bonnie: no ,  i &apos;m not stopping this ,  doctor .
 i will not stop it .
 you think they &apos;ll let me go after what i &apos;ve done ?
 the doctor: you &apos;re all the same ,  you screaming kids ,  you know that ?
  &apos;look at me ,  i &apos;m unforgivable .
  &apos; well here &apos;s the unforeseeable ,  i forgive you .
 after all you &apos;ve done .
 bonnie: you don &apos;t understand .
 you will never understand .
 the doctor: i don &apos;t understand ?
 are you kidding ?
 of course i understand .
 i mean ,  do you call this a war ,  this funny little thing ?
 this is not a war .
 i fought in a bigger war than you will ever know .
 i did worse things than you could ever imagine ,  and when i close my eyes .
 i hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count !
 and do you know what you do with all that pain ?
 shall i tell you where you put it ?
 you hold it tight .
 til it burns your hand .
 and you say this -- no one else will ever have to live like this .
 no one else will ever have to feel this pain .
 not on my watch .
 kate closes her box .
 the doctor: thank you .
 kate: i &apos;m sorry .
 the doctor: i know .
 i know ,  thank you .
 the doctor looks back to bonnie .
 bonnie: it &apos;s empty ,  isn &apos;t it ?
 both boxes -- there &apos;s nothing in them .
 the doctor: of course .
 but you know how you know that ?
 because you &apos;ve started to think like me .
 it &apos;s hell ,  isn &apos;t it ?
 no one should have to think like that .
 and no one will .
 not on our watch .
 the doctor and bonnie stare at one another for a moment .
 the doctor: gotcha .
 bonnie: how can you be so sure ?
 the doctor: because you have a disadvantage ,  zygella .
 i know that face .
 kate: well ,  this is all very well ,  but as know the boxes are empty now .
 we can &apos;t forget that .
 the doctor: no ,  well ,  uh .
 you &apos;ve said that the last 15 times .
 the doctor uses his sunglasses ,  which begin pulsing .
 bonnie: you didn &apos;t wipe my memory .
 oh ,  and your little friends here ,  of course .
 when they wake up ,  they won &apos;t remember what you &apos;ve done .
 it &apos;ll be our secret .
 bonnie: you &apos;re going to protect me ?
 osgood: well ,  you &apos;re one of us now ,  whether you like it or not .
 bonnie: i don &apos;t understand how you could just forgive me .
 the doctor: because i &apos;ve been where you have .
 there was another box .
 i was gonna press another button .
 i was going to wipe out all of my own kind .
 man ,  woman ,  and child .
 i was so sure i was right .
 bonnie: what happened ?
 the doctor: same thing that happened to you .
 i let clara oswald get inside my head .
 the doctor looks at clara .
 the doctor: trust me .
 she doesn &apos;t leave .
 yeah ,  it &apos;s not always ideal .
 but for splitting 3 things two ways ,  it &apos;s as fair as anything else (assuming you pick the splitter randomly) .
 and for the apples/oranges ,  it &apos;s probably best to split as you say and trade after the fact anyway
 there &apos;s no reason that mutually agreed trading couldn &apos;t take place after such a split .
 the split just establishes the baseline .
 or she doesn &apos;t like cake .
 if you &apos;d like ,  i &apos;ll dm you since i can &apos;t do formatting .
 plus we elect people ,  not platforms .
 we elect someone we trust  to do the right thing when confronted with unforeseeable crises and opportunities .
 i read something different .
 naturally ,  followed by an inability to offer up said source for critique
 i did hs debate when he was still alive and was shocked  to learn that he wasn &apos;t dead .
  i was so used to all the philosophers being dead: mills ,  kant ,  hobbes ,  rousseau ,  etc .
  blew my mind that a guy we were always talking about was still around .
 just like u/___hobbes to centralize all of the power into the hands of a single person .
 only to a certain extent ,  though .
 the description of hitler ,  for instance ,  would still obviously lack a foreign policy ,  a stance on civil rights ,  views on race ,  religion ,  gender ,  etc ,  that any serious constituency would demand be included in a written description of their candidates .
 they might also elect to purposefully not allow personal information like drinking habits or extramarital affairs under op &apos;s  &apos;system &apos; .
 it might also allow for candidates to answer questions relevant to the position without identifying themselves .
 i highly doubt that given the chance to ask the three mentioned politicians 10 questions i thought relevant to the position of chancellor/prime minister/president that i would somehow be  &apos;tricked &apos; by hitler .
 and if the argument then becomes ,   &apos;well then the politicians could simply \lie\ about their views and implement whatever extremist ,  racist ,  xenophobic policies they wanted once they became elected !
  &apos; i would ask how that is in any way better in our current system .
 granted i don &apos;t think this could ever work on a practical level ,  but i also don &apos;t think it &apos;s purely subjective just because someone is writing the descriptions .
 echo chambers are definitely part of it .
 i also think somewhat of a bystander effect .
 because the info is so easy to verify ,  we expect the messenger to have done their due diligence
 people decide how they feel first .
 facts that come later and contradict them publicly and personally get them very defensive .
 i notice this on facebook a lot when feel-good stories are shared and someone comments on the facts of the article that contradict all the happiness .
 overwhelmingly ,  people act upset at the people bringing the facts up for ruining the  &apos;message &apos; or the  &apos;story &apos; and people admit they don &apos;t care if it &apos;s true or not .
 this seems to go beyond the well-actually pedantic and semantics crowd right to serious facts that change everything .
 when you look at all the places you can get information now ,  and how quickly we can validate information now ,  it should be harder right .
 except not everyone is using the same sources .
 i guarantee you i can find scientists that argue against climate change or doctors that claim vaccines are dangerous .
 there is so much information out there it is easy to find something that confirms what you already believe and just ignore the rest .
 he didn &apos;t explicitly run on the platform of concentration camps ,  but he wrote mein kampf years before he became chancellor .
 he wasn &apos;t exactly trying to hide it and anyone who was paying attention to politics could have been reasonably expected to know he was fiercely antisemitic and blamed jews for germany &apos;s problems .
 he ran on doing shitty things to jews .
 mass murder is not a good look so obviously you can &apos;t put that in .
  &apos;well we gotta do something .
 i think it &apos;s naive or downright disturbing to suggest that genocide was never public policy .
 hitler always had genocidal ambitions discussed at length in his manifesto .
 the progression went from forcing emigration of  &apos;undesirables &apos; ,  to stripping the rights from them ,  to forcing them into concentration camps ,  to mass killings ,  to official ,  systematic genocide as the  &apos;final solution to the jewish question .
 i &apos;m sure the person you &apos;re responding to is merely misinformed ,  but you can &apos;t pretend like the idea of genocide was a spur of the moment thing .
 it was going to happen at some point and the manifestos and propaganda from the party before ,  during ,  and after their rise made no qualms about entertaining the idea of systematic slaughter .
 that &apos;s a page out of holocaust deniers &apos; books .
 you are confusing something here ,  that &apos;s true for the presidential election ,  but t does work the  &apos;old &apos; way in local politics .
 from a european perspective ,  it seems like you guys are focusing on the presidential election waaayyy too much .
 i mean ,  we do it too to some degree ,  but i guess we are lucky enough to be split  in many countries and having more choice ,  in terms of parties .
 if local politics was seen as the back bone of democracy ,  people from their would clime the ranks and there would be much more to base your decision on ,  outside of current news .
 that &apos;s one way to break the cycle you are talking about .
 because people don &apos;t like reality .
 the reality is that if you want to do something meaningful it is long ,  hard ,  and requires sacrifice .
 if it was easy it would already be done ,  odds are that it &apos;s not because it &apos;s going to be hard as fuck to actually make it happen .
 this is why when someone stands up to say they will work hard to reform medical care and stop citizens from going broke simply for getting sick they lose to the guy screaming that it &apos;s all the immigrants fault so we &apos;re gonna build a wall and keep them out which will magically make everybody millionaires !
 who cares about medical costs when you &apos;re rich right ?
 of course one of those people was being a delusional twat ,  but they don &apos;t actually have to deliver until they &apos;re elected at which point they can go on more tirades about how it &apos;s everyone elses fault what they said would happen didn &apos;t happen .
 i think what you just described is exactly the reason trump won in 2016 .
 he promised things .
 maybe not things you or i like ,  maybe not things he could achieve ,  but he promised things .
 and ,  to his (dubious) credit ,  he &apos;s very publicly tried to achieve a lot of the things he promised .
 he failed a lot ,  but we all saw him fail in the process of trying to fulfill these promises .
 if she promised something ,  i sure didn &apos;t hear about it .
 she tried to run on her experience and integrity .
 now ,  she &apos;s certainly not worse than trump ,  but .
 that &apos;s not exactly the most-solid platform for her to run on .
 that explains why it is in quotation marks .
 that man is a treasure .
 you cut the cake of decisions and your brain gets to pick ?
 yeah i &apos;m glad most top comments are shitting on it
 yes the student body usually votes for this
 it goes in your permanent record !
 yes it’s a real thing .
 yeah at my school the one special needs boy won both years (junior and senior) and he was so happy
 social hierarchy is absolutely baked into american schooling .
 i think they &apos;re saying ,  no voting history as a politician is still a voting history ,  i .
 it &apos;s still useful information .
 not to try and dig out voting history like who they voted for in elections .
 but they wouldn &apos;t research it they &apos;d just wait for someone else that they generally agree with to do the work instead and go with that
 poison pill politics .
 i &apos;ve been saying since before the aca was being debated that we need a constitutional amendment which limiting the scope of bills to what can be contained in a 144 character title and to a total character length of less than the constitution .
 we laid out an entire system of governance that had lasted over two centuries in under 10 pages ,  but congress now couldn &apos;t pass a bill requiring people to wipe their shoes on the doormat before entering the senate chamber without at least 100 pages .
 yeah ,  but then they lie .
 oh and maybe those who have 350 million dollars could spend more on these media messages compared to someone relying on grass roots support !
 we might end up with a plutocratic government filled with tycoons only seeking to enrich themselves and their social class !
 a commercial of his came on in the break room at work ,  talking about all of the good he &apos;s done for black people .
 as mayor ,  this dude oversaw and expanded stop and frisk for arguably the most corrupt and racist police force in the us .
 you divide ,  i decide
 you split i pick is what i called it .
 unless you are from minnesota .
 then the last piece is split infinitely in a quick executive decision in which the person wants the last piece but wouldn &apos;t dare be the one to take the last bit .
 this guy cocaines .
 rip your children if you divorce
 then you rock paper scissors to be the picker and if you lose you don &apos;t be a butthole about it .
 not if the splitter splits fairly
 you have never seen a down and out ,  balls to the wall fight until you see two siblings fight .
 i would die for my brothers ,  but when we were younger and fought ,  someone was getting a fat lip and the other one was getting a spanking .
 it’s the passion in it ,  that fine line between love and hate .
 being a felon generally disqualifies a person from running for public office ,  because candidates need to be electors and felons are not electors ,  but once an elected official takes office ,  they aren &apos;t automatically removed for a criminal conviction .
 i think if you &apos;re going to have a system like that it &apos;s all or nothing .
 either you take the same money everyone else does or not at all - no private donations whatsoever .
 i saw that and started playing it ,  but a few seconds in i thought they isolated out to remove the vocals ,  not make it only vocals .
 that does seem odd .
 the actor is peter capaldi ,  he puts so much emotion in the character that competes with david tennant and matt smith over who plays the best doctor to me .
 the best part is that that particular speech isn’t even his best moment .
 there’s one episode during capaldi’s era that’s essentially a 55 minute monologue ,  and it is goddamn perfect .
 imo one of the greatest pieces of media ever made .
 it can be really cheesy at times ,  but there are some absolutely amazing moments and this is near the top .
 that was so compelling .
 believe it or not ,  many if not most episodes of the show are just as compelling .
 if you ever have the time i would highly recommend watching it (starting with tennant ,  although personally i think smith and capaldi are better) .
 crazy how short the transcript is for occupying 10 minutes of screen time
 cruelty toward those who were cruel to you .
 so cyclic ,  so true to life .
 similarly ,  at a former job some oppressed people ousted some bullies ,  then the oppressed bullied the remainder .
 there was a real chance for peace .
 i think i disagree .
  plenty of people vote  &apos;straight ticket &apos; ,  so they are voting for platform over person .
 not that most actually know what the platform is ,  just that it isn &apos;t the other thing .
 problem is that those we elected have lied to us .
 it is what politicians do .
 yeah ,  not often you get to talk about the guy that revolutionized political thought only a couple of decades ago .
 there &apos;s a surprising amount of really important philosophers that died only recently .
 the catch is that most of them achieved things that are only indirectly important to the everyday life of an average person ,  and so people are rarely exposed to them .
 household names like rawls and de beauvoir are so well known partly because they were active in subfields that are ,  for lack of a better word ,  accessible and relevant to pretty much anyone .
 people like jaakko hintikka (d .
 2015) ,  while influential ,  are probably never going to reach the same kind of mass public appeal .
 it could easily and truthfully be rewritten as .
  &apos;candidate c: attempted a coup ,  sleeps until noon ,  killed his own dog with cyanide ,  was addicted to meth and had used gay friends up until the  &apos;night of the long knives &apos; &apos; .
 tried to stay on the same themes obviously not an exhaustive list of hitler &apos;s character failings .
 as strong as his biases were ,  it was the fact that those biases were shared (to some degree) by most of the german population that allowed him to rise to such power .
 he exploited an already existing intolerance for jews and homosexuality .
 hitler was most certainly a charismatic and passionate leader and that was no secret .
 it was core to the nazi ideology .
 people go from  &apos;well ,  we don &apos;t know when exactly hitler decided to implement systematic genocide &apos; to  &apos;there was no way blind voters could have known .
  &apos; racial german nationalism ,  expansionism ,  and the disenfranchisement and expulsion of  &apos;undesirables &apos; were core tenants of nsdap messaging .
 even if you didn &apos;t mention the genocide ,  it is fundamentally disingenuous to act like those were fringe policy positions held exclusively by hitler tangential to his rise to power .
 blaming jews for problems was ,  is ,  and sadly continues to be ,  in style .
 i wouldn &apos;t trust my body to vote for anything ,  especially back when it was a student !
 the thought of it !
 my stomach would &apos;ve sooner voted for buffalo wings and nachos before our prom queen and king .
 although ,  i loved them both ,  my dearest friends .
 they &apos;re a close third and fourth to wings and nachos .
 minutes before the pig blood !
 or your school can do what my school did and have essentially everyone win a title however as you got fewer and fewer votes you were given lesser titles
 hey what actually is the fork of damocles ?
 is there any way to acquire one &apos;s permanent record ?
 i &apos;d be fascinated to see the kind of teacherly shitposting  mz .
 williams had noted about me .
 who wins the vote usually ?
 is it the jock and the cheerleader like in the movies ?
 is that one of your constitutional things or is there something that could be done about it ?
 i remember when i read that amendment on the sample ballot i was researching to prepare for my election day vote .
 nothing like getting whiplash from reading an amendment .
 which they definitively wouldn &apos;t do in their blurbs !
 you could just do what other countries do and limit the amount of your own money you can spend on your campaign ?
 but he was so young and naive at the tender age of 60 .
 how could he have known what he was doing was wrong ?
 you divorce im in court .
 you define ,  i assign
 what &apos;d you just call me ?
 king solomon has entered the chat .
 hopefully they have an even number of kids 
 i think they were saying that it &apos;s better due to human error .
 even if someone attempts to divine something evenly ,  any mistake that occurs is in favor of the picker .
 in theory ,  theory and practice are the same - but in practice ,  they aren &apos;t .
 with other people ,  it &apos;s just a brawl .
 between brothers and sisters ,  it &apos;s a dog-eat-dog battle or a vicious catfight .
 it’s also a somewhat safe place to be that aggressive because deep down you know they’re going to forgive you because you forgave them the last time they pulled that shit ,  a brother’s love and all that .
 depends on the state ,  and federal offices have different requirements .
 you can be a felon presently serving time in prison in any state in the us ,  and stand for federal office .
 i can get convicted of murder ,  and the next day get my name on the ballot for president of the united states ,  and be elected ,  and take the oath of office and serve as president of the united states .
 you’d need a constitutional amendment to change the requirements for running for federal office to bar felons .
 currently as long as you were born a citizen ,  are 35 ,  and have lived 14 years in the us ,  you’re eligible to run for president .
 a felon can’t run for state office in pennsylvania ,  but they can run for the office of senator from pennsylvania .
 moreover ,  once elected to congress ,  the state can’t impede your ability to vote .
 so they’d be forced to allow you out of prison to attend sessions of congress .
 if it weren &apos;t for tennant &apos;s sheer nostalgia factor capaldi would be my favorite .
 he had some stumbles early on (that were entirely the fault of the writing ,  not his own) but he had a very particular gravity about him that really resonated with me .
 his acting was just perfect ,  almost to the point where i don’t know where to begin in describing it .
 the guy’s been a huge doctor who fanboy since childhood ,  and his understanding of the character really comes through in how complex and layered his portrayal is - he almost seems to have something from every previous doctor ,  while still being completely original .
 i’ve got soft spots for 8 and 6 ,  but 12’s my doctor ,  for sure .
 oh snap that &apos;s pretty high praise man ,  if i watch it as a one off will i miss the context that makes it so great ?
 or could i reasonably enjoy it if i watched just that episode
 i might check it out ,  the only entry to the series i have ever had is the  &apos;moisturize me &apos; episode ,  and i like high-concept sci-fi i just don &apos;t like too much camp .
 i &apos;m totally down for a look into the mind of a man who has lived several lifetimes and works to keep humanity safe with the wisdom he has gained ,  but there &apos;s just something about it that keeps me away
 reminds me of what &apos;s happening with israel and palestine .
 the oppressed have become the oppressor .
 especially that last bit when people are voting against something instead of for something .
 i feel that tends to cause more issues in general .
 this is one of the big areas of misunderstanding ,  i think .
 when you vote party line ,  i dont think you &apos;re voting on platform .
 there are some big general areas where parties differ but people in parties have differing opinions and do not necessarily follow the party line .
 in many cases ,  voting party line ,  means you could be voting in someone that has widely different beliefs .
 current politics almost require this .
  when a party threatens it &apos;s own congress members with  &apos;putting their heads on a pike &apos; if they don &apos;t vote the party line ,  that means putting anyone from that party into office is just a vote for the party line .
 but this boils down to the fact that very few representatives share the interests of the people .
 in an era where many do very little research for elections ,  advertisements and name recognition play a major role in our democratic process .
 whoever can put out more ads ,  or broadcast their message more widely will win .
 so the interest of a representative will more closely align with donors who can pay to broadcast their message ,  instead of the general population .
 we ,  the people ,  have gotten ourselves into this situation ,  the politicians are just playing their part .
 ooh we got mister popular here ,  friends with the prom king and queen !
 buffalo wings and nachos before anything .
 words to live by .
 name checks out .
 my body voted to sweat profusely when talking to girls when i was a student
 they’re all gonna laugh at you !
 aaand none for gretchen wieners .
 our prom king didn &apos;t even go to our school normally ,  he was a swedish exchange student .
 in most cases ,  yes .
 i remember in high school ,  for both homecoming and senior prom ,  the most popular people in my class won (although ,  for homecoming ,  it was likely that they cheated ,  but i wouldn &apos;t know - high school was 6 years ago for me) .
 my high school also had homecoming prince and princess for grades 9-11 ,  and for grade 10 ,  one of the least popular girls got it ,  which was nice to see for once .
 freshman year was a mess ,  though - my class treated it like a mean joke .
 we had a weird mix .
 for homecoming we had the football star who was also a cool guy as king ,  and a less popular but smartest person in the class as queen .
 for prom ,  we had the smartest guy who was really nice but not popular ,  and the hottest cheerleader .
 it was also a small class ,  so while there were still some clicks ,  if you liked music or getting high ,  or throwing a frisbee ,  everyone got along pretty well .
 he also blamed the subprime mortgage crisis on the elimination of redlining .
 redlining was one of the biggest contributors of making sure black people stay poor by keeping them from building value on their homes ,  making it impossible to accrue generational wealth .
 yeah he couldn &apos;t have known until afterwards when he admitted that he knew all along .
 damn ,  you paying alimony even though you got no kids ?
 that &apos;s rough bro .
 woah woah woah man too much
 always cracked me up that the story portrays that particular baby thief as also being so deranged that she would be okay with half a baby .
 like what if he got the exact same issue between two different women ,  and tried this shtick ,  and instead of the true mother being revealed on the merits of only one of them not being okay with a bisected baby ,  both women were just like  &apos;the fuck is wrong with you ?
 we &apos;re gonna work it out ourselves ,  you got problems .
 i’ll take the top half !
 i want the legs of both children
 one kid is not equal to the other so you have to split each kid to really be fair .
 maybe ,  but if the splitter does a perfect split 50/50 ,  then they will always get half the value according to their preferences .
 if the picker &apos;s values diverge even a little ,  they will always do better than 50% according to their values .
 so picking is better .
 and sisters ,  i &apos;m the only girl with 3 brothers .
 just because i don &apos;t like to fight(what person does ?
 ) doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t .
 you could probably watch it as a one-off ,  but there are a couple events that lead up to it .
 i could dm you about it ,  if you’d like !
 if you liked capaldi ,  you could start from season 10 of the new series .
 that was his third (and last) season in the show ,  but i think it works better for a new viewer than the previous two ,  as it reintroduces a lot of concepts through the eyes of a new companion .
 it has some references to characters and moments from the past of the show but you should be able to watch most of it without being too confused .
 and by this point the cgi is better and the show is less campy than before .
 then you can follow up to the current season 12 ,  and then catch up to previous seasons
 hutus and tutsis .
 sunni and shiet .
 white and black .
 it’s a theme that echoes throughout history and it only stops when the oppressed forgive their oppressors .
 this is the key point mlk jr tried to impart to america but unfortunately it has mostly fallen on deaf ears .
 i don &apos;t know that your reason defends your argument .
 people vote party line because they assume that that person &apos;s platform aligns with their own beliefs .
 super easy to blame everyone else in the system (or even the system) when things don &apos;t happen in their favor .
  &apos;i &apos;m not the problem ,  it &apos;s all the other elected officials holding me back .
 he was homeschooled .
 ah ,  but then they started dating ,  and i was promoted to 3rd wheel !
 got no room for bs unless it’s burritos ‘n’ salsa
 he was bribing everyone with surströmming ,  i imagine .
 usa elects sweden to run it .
 actually sounds smart .
 at least he &apos;s not paying child support with no kids
 i love that in the original story the deranged baby splitter has only stolen the child to begin with because she kills her own first by rolling over on it in her sleep and then tries to pull a switcheroo on the other mother like she &apos;s indiana jones in the beginning of raiders of the lost ark .
 thank you for the valuable lesson on ethics u/fascist_unicorn
 then it’s no longer the kings problem .
 win win for solomon .
 she is sooo messed up that she refers to it as “the top half .
 but you also get the butts you have to wipe .
 i &apos;d rather have the torsos ,  arms ,  and hands so we can eventually play video games together .
 if they &apos;re both equally bad at assessing 50% then it &apos;s equally likely they &apos;ll both be wrong .
 also an only girl to 3 brothers ,  but i &apos;m the oldest .
 how did you fare ?
 i did great staying in charge ;) until the first one hit 11 years old ,  then it was all over for me .
 i can still call respect with my big sister voice(tm) .
 we &apos;re in our 40s now ,  though ,  so it &apos;s not really necessary .
 i &apos;m wondering what they &apos;re going to do with her .
 what her defining characteristic will be .
 looking at the various patterns in the series ,  i &apos;d expect something reminiscent of the second doctor - something trickstery ,  light-hearted ,  a sea change from the gravitas of the previous incarnation .
 what i hope is that the writers aren &apos;t going to be shackled by jodie being the first female incarnation ,  and thus feeling that they have to write a super-doctor ,  someone who is perfect at everything (because god forbid a female character be allowed to exhibit flaws) ,  or a cardboard cutout where every single storyline has some kind of anti-sexism message .
 let this doctor be strange and weird and alien and sometimes fallible and show flashes of her previous incarnations and build on them .
 i don &apos;t want thirteen to be just  &apos;the female doctor &apos; .
 not to mention i hope they have a plan in place for the next incarnation .
 is it going to be female ?
 (either will have some kind of backlash .
 ) some middle ground ?
 (more backlash for  &apos;half and half &apos; .
 although there might be an out .
 the second doctor was forcibly regenerated and his next appearance chosen for him .
 there could be a parallel arc/event ,  with the fourteenth doctor being - for example - a much older lady .
 very different from thirteen ,  and exploring new casting territory again ,  but still having those callbacks .
 and come on; who wouldn &apos;t want to see a granny-weatherwax-styled doctor ?
 white and black .
 for a moment i completely forgot  &apos;races &apos; and was trying to figure out what one color had done to the other .

 guy in his basement develops a cure for cancer and gives it away for free .
 someone invents a cure for cancer ,  because ,  you know ,  fuck cancer .

 aliens ,  but they &apos;re the good kind .
 like vulcans ,  but fun and sexy .
 they cure all our diseases ,  give us the secret of perpetual clean energy ,  and adopt us as their  &apos;little sister planet .
  &apos; they think we &apos;re cute and fun to have around .
 that meteor that hits earth is an alien space ship and they set up alien internet so we can learn all their science .
 apparently this is the plot of a lot of movies and shows .
 ireland will have four actual seasons as opposed to winter rain ,  spring rain , summer rain and autumn rain .
 a meteor lightly impacts the earth in the middle of the ocean ,  killing no one .
 but not just any meteor ,  this one has bacteria on it that mysteriously cures blindness ,  deafness ,  diabetes ,  and all forms of dementia .
 this isn &apos;t an answer to op &apos;s question ,  but reading through all the other answers here ,  i just have to say .
 it &apos;s really touching and wholesome for once .
 many people are wishing for peace ,  advancements in healthcare ,  for people to prosper all over the world ,  to possibly meet alien life and learn from them ,  some funny shenanigans and fun ,  etc .
 that &apos;s really wholesome .
 i &apos;m so emotional all of a sudden .
 anyway ,  that &apos;s all .

 a rash of benevolent billionaires begin hacking into people &apos;s accounts (i .
 student loans ,  mortgages ,  credit cards) and paying them off .
 it &apos;s illegal cause they are hacking into your accounts and accessing all your p .

 except the debt companies ,  they want that shit to stop .
 i still get to work from home .
 me quitting drugs and feeling happy .
 well considering 2020 has had something crazy happen almost every month ,  this is what i &apos;d propose: .
 jan) rather than crazy bush fires in australia ,  they invent an effective eradication method for covid-19 .
 99% effective that basically reduces it to a cold ,  it &apos;s released to the world and enables all countries to stabilize .
 feb-mar) unprecedented global free trade deals between most major powers ,  enabling nearly every country to financially recover and begin to prosper after 2020 .
 apr-may) the top 10% wealthiest people in the world decide to donate 10% of their funds back to society as a thank you to the world .
 this should effectively raise the socio-economic state of the bottom 50% of people .
 increasing overall spending and helping small businesses around the world recover .
 june-july) peace in the middle east .
 the people of the middle eastern countries ,  fed up with their quality if life ,  finally get peace .
 rebuilding of many destroyed city &apos;s and towns ,  a major upgrade to infrastructure in the areas .
 aug-oct) cure for some forms of cancer is finally achieved .
 mass rollout across the world ,  breakthroughs in other cancer treatments .
 nov-dec) contact with our first alien race ,  peaceful negotiations begin along with the trade of information and technology .
 a new age of enlightenment begins .
 -edit- just wanted to thank everyone for the up votes and awards .
 also: it amuses me to no end that a post that ends with first contact with aliens and a new age of enlightenment has so much controversy over the redistribution of 10% of wealth .

 my wife gets a kidney transplant and we might be able to get our late son a sibling .
 it’s bizarre and will probably not happen ,  but it’s a good thing .
 since a lot of people have asked - we live in sweden ,  so to all you americans offering to donate your kidneys: you are amazing beings ,  but i don’t think we can arrange anything since corona is a bitch .
 but my wife and i want you to know we’ve read all of your comments and they’re all heartwarming 3

 we all get bionic eyes ,  spines ,  and limbs .
 we can turn ambient heat into electricity ,  simultaneously solving the energy crisis and climate change (in fact we gotta use some of that free energy to warm things back up !
 cancer is cured and there &apos;s too many out of work oncologists .
 we all realize that nobody actually needs to do most of the work we &apos;re all pretending to do ,  so we let the robots do it for us .
 almost nobody works anymore ,  since universal basic income is more than enough to live well .
 life on europa .
 life on the friggin &apos; moon .
 even life in the space vacuum between planets .
 now that we know how to look ,  it turns out life is everywhere !
 since energy is so cheap now and everyone is rich ,  it &apos;s trivial to design hundreds of missions to send thousands of people to explore all the cool stuff we find in the solar system .

 a new virus hits which affects the nervous system and causes everyone to feel loved and everyone gets real cuddly
 dogs are everywhere and waiting for someone to pet and hug them .
 don &apos;t do that ,  don &apos;t give me hope .

 mosquitoes are responsible for wiping out covid - eliminating themselves in the process .
 zombie apocalypse ,  except the zombies are just kind of chill and want to hang out and play roblox .
 the austraila fires ended up just killing bad plants and things like that ,  covid-20 ends up cleaning our body &apos;s making everyone super healthy ,  and the riots ended up being peaceful and all was good .

 the best pockets ,  ask anybody ,  they &apos;ll tell you .
 i may be missing a trick here ,  but i can hear this coming out of the whitehouse: .
 reporter-  &apos;mr trump ,  what do you think about american women &apos;s clothes having pockets ?
 trump- &apos;women &apos;s clothes have pockets .
 the most tremendous pockets .
 until some fuck part of the big pharma family manages to regulate it .
 do we really want 7 billion deadpools running around ?
 but ,  no cancer would be a good thing .
 poor cancer ,  it &apos;s been a good guy this whole time and wants to know why we &apos;ve been trying to kill it with radiation and chemo treatment .
 bring back his brother so we can have dinosaurs too !
 my boyfriend has been warned that if sir david dies we will be holding our own funeral with all family members in attendance .

 once i get rid of depression ,  it’s over for you bitches
 oh how i wish this was truly possible .
 vulcans are fun and sexy !
  &apos;we can &apos;t trust the aliens ,  they just want to take american energy jobs &apos;
 god ,  people like to say that if aliens do exist that they would be dicks .
 but if they do show up ,  i hope they are bros and make all of our lives amazing .
 current leadership leaves a lot to be desired .
 and they bang us ,  but they &apos;re aliens so my wife doesn &apos;t consider it cheating ?
 omg i will make such a good pet for the aliens !
 let’s be real if aliens showed up and were friendly like this then there would be large groups of racists (speciesest ?
 ) that would commit hate crimes and scare them off .
 don &apos;t you remember that episode of the twilight zone ?
 learn all their science .
 that’s a weird way to say “watch alien porn” .
 great ,  my most upvoted comment is about watching alien porn .
 and that kids is how the datasphere came to be
 and then we reverse engineer their ship’s advanced technology and use it to create a giant space ship and name it the “resolute” and then use it to transfer humans to alpha centauri .
 i read something that basically said that all the worlds problems can be summed up by saying that humanities power has grown far faster than our civilizations maturity .
 meaning we cannot properly wield it .
 i feel that this event would just cause more problems as the people with all the resources would look at it and their eye balls would turn into money symbols like a gosh darn cartoon .
 and california and the southwest usa gets it instead
 i was in ireland during a heatwave in the early 2000s and wow ,  you could really spot the locals .
 they all turned bright red .
 nah ,  not buying it .
 there &apos;s wet ,  wetter ,  the two random sunny days in april and september ,  and cold .
 makes me think of  &apos;little britain &apos; when they talk about scotland .
 what like a better 2018 ?
 it was winter rain ,  spring rain ,  summer drought ,  autumn rain .
 and we won a grand slam/beat the all blacks
 well jeez i guess people like first commenters .

 it’s an almost unlimited amount .
 hospitals charge $20000 a month .

 thanks reddit for the pick me up !
 it &apos;s a nice break from the usual doom and gloom + fear mongering :)
 my favorite part is that all this happened without them flagging it as serious replies only !
 5 state solution is the best .
 3 to live in harmony ,  the other two to continue fighting each other .
 two or more state solution in the middle east ,  but florida is also in play; loser gets to move there .
 with eddie gone ,  we will never get the 10 years of van halen .
 im gonna live forever
 these are the three pillars of good health .
 please be a fortune teller !

 i don &apos;t think the debt companies would necessarily care ,  they &apos;d have all their money ?
 i am so much more productive and comfortable when i wfh .
 i’ve also become a lot more confident speaking up in meetings and client presentations .
 i hope wfh never ends .
 i hope the covid part ends soon though .
 hey ,  thank you everyone .
 i wasn &apos;t expect this response .
 i guess i don &apos;t have to wait till 2021 since i enrolled in a drug treatment program along with therapy a few days ago .
 i really hope this will be a new and better chapter of my life .
 i want nothing more than to get clean and really live and manage life in a healthier and happier way .

 im an addict going on 16yrs of being clean from heroin and various pills .
 you can do it my friend .
 man that is no bizarre 2021 shit .
 you can do it ,  we believe in you !
 best of lucks friend .
 plot twist: the aliens manufactured 2020 to save us from ourselves .
 the world almost collapsing at the end of 2020 is the trigger that helps us overcome our societal issues and create a new ,  better ,  more united world .
 this better world is what allows them to officially breach the prime directive and welcome .
 if they hadn’t done 2020 ,  we might have destroyed ourselves or never managed .
 the top 10% wealthiest people in the world decide to donate 10% of their funds back to society as a thank you to the world .
 unfortunately the least likely of any of these .
 i told my friend that everything went to shit after david bowie left .
 i &apos;m glad someone is on the same wavelength lol .
 and prince was with him ,  they were collaborating on an album .
 it turns out bowie was the glue holding us all together this whole time .
 yea but temperature changes that quick probably mean an ice age 
 i hope 2021 is full of blessings for you and your family .
 sending you both hugs
 put her in one of those trailers on a bike and cycle with her .
 she may not remember all of it but she gets to see lovely vistas with someone she loves ,  even if they only last a few seconds each .
 that’s devastating ,  i’m so sorry .
 i second this wholeheartedly .
 i hope the best for your dog ,  my man .
 i hope your dog will be ok .
 i have my fingers crossed for him/her !
 and so do all the other dogs .
 no more cancer for dogs ever .
 calories in calories out ,  me being an intellectual eats only 8 krispy creams a day so i can stay in my caloric deficit .
 turns out we can use stored fat/calories as an electrical charging station including being used as a power source for transportation .
 pizza every fucking day .
 but what if the owner has children who also love the dog ?
 well ,  the dog is sad when they see the owner die ,  unless you mean the dog instantly dies at the same time as the owner ,  which would be a pretty dick move if the owner is on his death bed and the dog is perfectly healthy .
 ha ,  like elder scrolls vi will be released next year .
 best case scenario is skyrim on your phone .
 get in shape ,  hah .
 it’s going to be vr brothels all over the place .
 ok but then you gotta deal with having a bad case of the shits that never goes away .
  that fat still has to go somewhere .
 depends on who’s in charge lol
 of all the things here this is hands down the least believable and likely
 _anal paper cuts_ .
 covid-20 would make everyone shit 20 dollar bills for a week ,  but you’d have to deal with a fever and take medication for the natural side effects of having your digestive system somehow convert food into money .
 are you hosting a 300+ person house party by chance ?
 we &apos;re hoping for a kidney next year too .
 fingers crossed for all of us .
 my condolences on the loss of your son .
 sounds like it &apos;s been a tough few years .
 well that sucks - i hope it happens for you !
 i hope this happens for you !
 this one hit me hard .
 any chance you want to start a reddit movement to find a donor ?
 if i get to choose one good thing to happen in 2021 ,  i choose this guy &apos;s wife .
 my wife will likely need a liver transplant soon .
 i feel your pain .
 reddit should have a subreddit for matching people with potential donors .
 what blood type is your wife ?
 there are also organ exchange programs for loved ones i believe where loved ones who don &apos;t match find compatible matches from other people in similar situations .
 i &apos;ll be your friend .
  i &apos;m into a lot of hobbies and if you ever need someone to talk to i am a pretty good conversationalist .
 ok ,  i usually never do the edit thing but here goes .
 thank you for everyone that gave me awards ,  that is very nice and i sincerely appreciate it .
 i just want to say that if you are looking for a friend i searched for a subreddit that is dedicated to this /r/needafriend  (to be honest ,  if this didn &apos;t exist i would make a new subreddit ,  but this seems great .
 just to kind of to put this out there ,  i know everyone has a few irl friends but sometimes it can be difficult to make new ones ,  either because of your age or idk ,  global pandemic .
 a few years ago i went through and awful separation that left me with a lot of trust issues .
  i started to play evony and made tons of international  &apos;virtual &apos; friends .
  i used to play the game to get away from everything but then found that the virtual friends that i made were just as awesome as my  &apos;real &apos; friends .
  they were always there to give me advice ,  or just listen .
  you can be that for someone today and it could make all the difference in their life .
 so sincerely ,  if anyone needs someone to talk to reach out .
 i believe in youuuuuu
 :( i &apos;d love this game
 the cheeseburger trees got me .
 depends on the topic imo .
 my accounting classes probably wouldn’t have changed much in person .
 i would have liked a discount though .
 we hear you and know that we’re in way over our heads trying to make online classes worth it but you’re right .
 for many subjects it just isn’t working .
 in addition to your refund ,  i wish for faculty and staff to be appropriately compensated for the extra work we’re doing .
 many of us have had our pay cut by the pandemic which is especially frustrating given the overtime we’re putting in to create an admittedly subpar online alternative .
 not the winds of winter .
 another season 8 .
 sad a song of ice and fire fan noises
 i didn &apos;t even know i wanted mambo no .
 you had me up until july that this could be possible .
 i literally just finished listening to mambo no .
 5 as i stated reading your post .
 hahahaha i can’t
 can i suggest something ?
 1: all i want is a good song ,   .
 2: the alien does this shit but then calls in a space port nearby .
 3: october event is that cthullu is summoned but hes actually a cool guy
 it also turns out the aliens have been developing their technologys and we share inventions ,  resources and ideologys .
 oncologists can still work .
 they had to learn general medicine first i think .
 after all ,  they did say they were gonna release the snapshots at around 2021
 unfortunately the vp has the same constitutional requirements as the president ,  so arnie doesn &apos;t qualify .
 how could we tell them apart ?
 yea ,  but which spice girl is he gonna impregnate ?
 can we put a happy little bob ross on the new rushmore ?
 also butts on the backside .
 that would be funny
 the sad thing is that the alien visitation and the oreo cookie sperm is far more likely then this .
 funny thing is ,  bill and melinda gates have actually been doing their best to save as many lives as possible with their fortune and are still vilified for it .
 jesus i &apos;ve prayed six times for a new triple aaa pc to run cyberpunk but i &apos;ve gotten no reply
 your getting laid down on a bed to take a nap .
 that still sounds revolting .
 i replaced all the oreo creme with semen and my wife didn &apos;t even notice .
 the motherfucking hds is announced ,  just an hd 3ds .
 hd supported on large majority of games ,  select titles updated with hi-res textures .
 online still free .
 actual second circle pad .
 n64 virtual console with dozens of titles .
 hard disk drive because they had to put something fucking useless in it
 and people are no longer afraid or allergic to them
 next thing you know ,  chadwick boseman &apos;s gonna pop out of a portal going  &apos;ayo im back from the dead !
 don’t get my hopes up man
 to you there probably isnt bigger things ,  and that &apos;s ok .
 tremendous tremendous just great pockets like nobody has ever seen before .
 the most beautiful pockets ,  so beautiful
 the discoverer of insulin ,  frederick banting ,  sold his patent to the university of toronto for 1 dollar because he thought it would save many lives .
 but the pharmaceutical companies made some minor changes and then patented that .
 that &apos;s why they can sell it for these exorbitant prices .
 banting and his colleagues would be spinning in their graves today .
 i should have rather said  &apos;incremental changes &apos; .
 as pointed out by a few comments below ,  a lot of effort has since been put to make insulin safer and effective .
 however ,  after frederick sanger discovered the structure of human insulin and thus enabling the manufacturing a synthetic version using modern methods there are no excuses for the unfair pricing .
 ps - both banting (1923) and sanger (1958) won the nobel prize in chemistry for thier work on insulin .
 but then again ,  imagine 7 billion deadpools just running around ,  playing airsoft with real weapons as a school sport
 we are waiting until we can clone him sucessfully and then we bring him back and put him in a theme park with all the other national treasures .
 don’t put those candles too close !
 i mean to be fair i do enjoy being on my own .
 the other thing that bothers the heck out of me is the fact that i don &apos;t have a car so i can not just do random things which i love .
 i would probably just use a partner to go out more .
 it &apos;s been a long time i &apos;ve been in a museum or something .
 /r/wowthanksimcured shuts down ,  like /r/thanksobama
 then we fuck the shit out of these aliens
 t &apos;pol was easily the hottest person in all of star trek .
 that was hilarious ,  thanks for sharing
 what do you think is on the radio ?
 you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise ?
 they talk by flapping their meat at each other .
 they can even sing by squirting air through their meat .
 this is altogether too much .
 as a singer ,  this tickled me .
 possibly relevant: i &apos;m mostly vegetarian .
 this is phenomenal .
 thank you for sharing !
 the ending is super sad to me .
 fun all the way through though !
 when someone posts a story and the domain is mit .
 edu ,  you know you &apos;re in for a treat !
 oh my gosh it &apos;s like a scene from intergalactic seinfeld
 marriage vows are definitely only applicable to terrestrial relations ,  yes .
 we &apos;ll make great pets !
 we &apos;ll make great pets !
 2021 will be district 9 but everyone will be clappin &apos; dem alien cheeks .
 when hentai becomes sci-fi
 actually they came to earth to lean the ways of our porn
 i’m pretty sure they can take a few notes from our tentacle porn and other fetishes .
 at that point wouldnt it be a nature documentary ?
 ah yea i loved lost in space
 and unicorns are real .
 2021 ,  the year california isn &apos;t on fire .
 -every californian every time it rains
 i got the worst sunburn of my life in ireland six years ago and my fiancée makes fun of me for it to this day !
  &apos;of course you should wear sunscreen !
 you got sunburned in ireland .
 who gets sunburned in ireland ?
 and state exam season ,  the only consistently sunny time of the year .
 yes ,  but what about ireland ?
 my first awards (ever) and my first gold !
 thanks ,  kind strangers !
 we need more opportunities like this where people can have fun and talk about solutions ,  rather than just furthering the frenzy of fear for the future .
 not that we should become complacent ,  but i dont think the bad news is even remotely balanced at the moment

 the biggest blessing of working from home ,  in my own opinion at least ,  has been how ,  when there &apos;s nothing to do ,  i haven &apos;t had to  &apos;look busy &apos; .
 when work reaches a dead point ,  and there &apos;s nothing to do ,  i can just play some switch ,  or watch youtube videos .
 i &apos;m still available if anyone needs anything ,  but i &apos;m not sat staring at an unimportant spreadsheet so that other people don &apos;t think i &apos;m lazy .

 the question now is: if that secret is ever revealed to humanity ,  how would we respond ?
 2016 was an absolutely shit year for celebrity deaths .

 we are actually still in an ice age right now .
 iirc ice ages are characterized by the presence of glaciers which persist throughout the entire year .
 they are melting but we have places in the world with snow and ice coverage year-round .

 we can use stored fat/calories  .
 as a power source for transportation .
 if only we had the proper machinery ,  we could use the energy from our metabolism to power some sort of repetitive or cyclic bodily motion ,  and we could harness that energy to move us forward !
 we could use our metabolism to power our bodies to power a machine .
 perhaps we could call it .

 he looked above to spot the sleigh   .

 the cry ,   &apos;goodnight ,  to one and all !
 he watched him go -   .
 he shared a smile -   .
 he warmed his hands ,  and for a while ,    .
 there were no gripes -    .
 there were no grumps -   .
 there were no doubts or donald trumps -   .
 there were no fears -   .
 there were no ends -   .

 in person learning and interaction has benefits that can’t be replicated by virtual learning ,  just like fully remote learning / work has its own set of challenges .
 i’m sure some students learn better in person ,  and unlike me my husband can’t wait to get back to the office .
 but we should take note of these positive changes and let students / employees choose how they would like to work and learn .
 if i could’ve participated in classes virtually back in uni ,  i would’ve done a lot better and been a lot more vocal in class .
 wasn’t so much shyness but my anxiety and nerves that prevented me from speaking up ,  but those factors become much more manageable in a virtual environment .
 depends on how long it takes for the secret to come out .
 relatively soon ,  like same generation ?

 upon further thought ,  i &apos;ve come to the realization that the largest muscles are in the leg ,  and so therefore this machine should be powered by the legs .
 the natural point from which we should apply this power is the feet ,  and so we need to find a way for this machine to harness a cyclic ,  repetitive motion from the feet .
 the exact mechanism will have to be fleshed out later ,  but perhaps in light of this revelation we should rename the machine to something more apt ?

 i somehow completely forgot about carrie fischer .

 at that point i just wanted to scream for the 80s as a whole ,  but that &apos;s hard to do .

 ever since watching atla i have made it important for me to become more like iroh .
 first i tried the voice ,  and to my surprise i sounded most like him when i was saying positive and soothing things .
 and then i thought about what i was saying as i said it ,  and i understood more - after all ,  atla is heavily based on eastern spirituality ,  so it makes sense that the series makes people introspective .
 it &apos;s almost designed to be that way .
 anyway ,  i &apos;m learning to be more like iroh ,  and it &apos;s interesting !
 i forgot he died that year too !
 just a devastating year .
 a healthy relationship and familiarity with death and loss it is !
 hey ,  do you want to develop my app ?
 this reads like a sketchy advertisement on some anime/manga/movie aggregator site
 nah ,  immortal dogs is much more likely than this .
 seriously ,  though - there is no healthy relationship with death for most people .
 there can only be ,  at best ,  grudging acceptance .
 death is only ever a good thing in the face of overwhelming pain and suffering ,  and the majority of people are not in that state .
 this is hilarious ,  thanks
 i am a police officer in a medium sized suburban town in texas .
 i have been in law enforcement for 14 years .
 i love my job ,  i love how i get to help people and i love how i get to cause positive changes in peoples &apos; lives .
 9% of the time ,  my badge is shiny .
 today my badge is not shiny .
 i am tired of hearing the excuses given by other people for a police officer &apos;s misconduct .
 i am tired of excuses being made for people who tarnish my badge .
 i am so tired of hearing how officers have a stressful job and their misconduct was a result of that stress .
 you know who else is under stress ?
 the people who called us ,  that person whose loved one just committed suicide ,  the family who called us because they found grandma dead and now we &apos;re asking everyone questions ,  the 7-11 clerk who just had a gun shoved in his face ,  and even the guy we just put in handcuffs and told him he is losing his freedom .
 sorry ,  but our stress is low compared to these folks .
 we might have to go into these situations ,  but we get to leave them and pretend none of that shit ever happened after our shift is over .
 i am tired of hearing excuses for the bad police officers ,  i am tired of the excuse  &apos;well ,  he puts his life in danger &apos; .
 sure ,  i know we put our lives in danger ,  i &apos;ve had guns ,  knives and even swords pulled on me .
 i &apos;ve responded to bomb threats ,  suicidal subjects ,  assaults in progress ,  robberies in progress ,  etc .
 you know who else puts their lives in danger ?
 fire fighters ,  deep sea fisherman ,  loggers ,  people who step foot outside their homes in chicago .
 we are trained to deal with danger ,  we are provided with equipment and training to help us survive those dangers .
 do i face an increased risk of not going home ?
 sure ,  but that &apos;s why i am at an increased level of awareness at work ,  so i can respond to threats appropriately without panic and over responding .
 i am tired of hearing about the thin blue line .
 i believe in the thin blue line ,  i believe in looking out for my fellow officers .
 i don &apos;t believe in hiding the misconduct or unlawfulness of other officers ,  and i have always spoken up .
 what many forget ,  standing behind the thin blue line doesn &apos;t mean concealing the misconduct of other officers ,  it means confronting those officers so they don &apos;t do something to ruin their lives ,  the lives of others ,  or violate the law or code of conduct .
 it means walking up to the officer with his knee on a suspect &apos;s neck and saying  &apos;dude ,  this is too much ,  stop &apos; ,  before the officer commits murder .
 it means walking up to the officer who has been drinking all night and saying  &apos;dude ,  i &apos;ll give you a ride home &apos; .
 instead of hiding misconduct ,  prevent it ,  help your fellow officer not do something to ruin his life or another &apos;s life .
 if you do see misconduct ,  address it ,  take it to the appropriate level ,  stop tarnishing my badge .
 we took an oath to uphold the law ,  uphold our ethics and protect our communities ,  sometimes that means arresting other police officers or holding them accountable for policy/ethics violations .
 this officer violated the rights of george floyd and murdered him through his actions .
 the officers who were on scene and failed to act are just as responsible .
 there are multiple videos of this incident and there is no real question as to what happened .
 for those folks who wonder what makes it murder or manslaughter .
 murder is the act of causing death to another human being through an action which a reasonable person would know (or intend) could result in the death of the victim .
 manslaughter is the act of causing death through an act which is reckless in nature .
 every officer in america is taught about positional asphyxiation and while some departments allow neck restraints ,  all officers are taught the dangers of neck restraints and are taught not to apply pressure to the back of someone &apos;s neck or head when they are proned out on the ground in handcuffs .
 floyd was handcuffed with little resistance and they were able to walk him across the street to a patrol unit .
 floyd can be seen in a surveillance video falling to the ground next to the unit on the sidewalk side of the unit .
 cell phone footage then shows the officer on top of floyd &apos;s neck on the opposite side of the unit ,  the street side .
 there is a random man in the background telling floyd just to get in the car and he can &apos;t win .
 floyd can be heard saying he knows and he &apos;s done .
 this implies that floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape ,  but was still restrained in the handcuffs .
 floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can &apos;t breathe .
 the cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of floyd &apos;s neck for at least eight minutes ,  with around four of those minutes with floyd being unconscious .
 even if floyd did attempt to resist or escape ,  there was no reason to hold him down for eight minutes .
 what was the point of restraining him for so long ?
 why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker ?
 why did the primary officer continue to restrain floyd by his neck after floyd became unresponsive ?
 why can the officer be heard at some point asking floyd if he is still a tough guy ?
 i can only come up with one answer to all of these questions ,  and that was the primary officer ,  chauvin ,  wanted to prove to floyd that floyd was not such a tough guy .
 i see an officer assaulting another human being ,  going beyond taking control of a suspect ,  using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being .
 i see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing ,  despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy .
 i see officers who were trying to get back at floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they knew could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force .
 this officer committed murder ,  plain and simple .
 this officer tarnished my badge and the badges of all police officers .
 worst of all ,  this officer tortured his victim for eight minutes ,  imagine your last thoughts and memories being those of a police officer ,  a person who the public is supposed to be able to trust ,  placing his body weight on your neck ,  slowly asphyxiating you against hot asphalt while he asks you if you &apos;re still a tough guy .
 i hope this officer ,  and any officer who allowed this to happen ,  is tried and convicted .
 it &apos;s going to be some time before i can polish my badge back to a shine ,  in the mean time ,  a family is suffering ,  a community is burning ,  all because of one guy who should have never been an officer .
 what do i think ?
 i think assholes like this make my job that much harder and damage the trust i work so hard for .
 i think assholes like this ruin peoples &apos; lives and ruin families .
 i think assholes like these should be stuck in a prison with all of the people they ever arrested .
 for all the police officers here what would the charges be if one of the bystanders pulled the police officer off of the poor guy ?
 wow thanks for gold !
 i &apos;m a former police officer ,  and so have had plenty of training in physical restraint of individuals being arrested .
 there is no police academy training officers to kneel on someone &apos;s neck to subdue them ,  that &apos;s how you kill a person .
 there is extensive training on how to avoid seriously injuring a person while restraining them ,  and i guarantee you every one of these officers was trained to never strike a person in the neck or choke them .
 the officer who killed him is very clearly liable for manslaughter at the very least ,  and i think the other officers who stood by have some accountability as well because they knew damn well that was not how you handle a person ,  and should have stepped up .
 absolutely sick to my stomach .
 i &apos;m a lieutenant in my home town police department .
 i started my day by showing the video to my officers and making sure my people understood that this is murder ,  plain and simple .
 you never ,  outside of a life and death struggle ,  do anything like this .
 george floyd was handcuffed and on the ground .
 if he was still struggling badly enough that they felt a need to hold him down ,  there &apos;s a hundred ways to do it safely .
 use of force should always be as measured and considered as possible .
 there will always be times where an officer sees danger and has to make a split second decision without the luxury of weighing the consequences .
 that clearly was not the case here .
 he had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing .
 he had multiple people there telling him to stop .
 and none of his fellow officers intervened .
 all of that is why i find this incident particularly disgusting .
 they had so many chances to do the right thing .
 luckily ,  i have the fortune of working with good people who see this shit for what it is .
 before the video was over ,  before i told them that george floyd died because of this ,  my officers were muttering things like ,   &apos;what the fuck is he doing ?
  &apos;  &apos;you can &apos;t do that shit &apos; and  &apos;he needs to get off the man &apos;s fucking neck !
  &apos; made me way prouder to be their leader than any number of arrests they could make to see that their instincts were not to defend the officer .
 for what it &apos;s worth ,  i &apos;m glad that they were fired .
 i &apos;ve heard mention in this thread that one of the officers has been arrested ,  which is great if true .
 i hope they &apos;re all brought to justice .
 their actions (and lack thereof) were completely unconscionable .
 not a local ,  am a fed .
 5 years into the job .
 george floyd was murdered and it’s fucking disgusting .
 we’re trained that anything involving the neck is a no-go and is considered deadly force .
 we were also trained that if you make an arrest in a prone position ,  you search and then immediately move them onto their side or a seated position because the risk of asphyxiation is so great .
 if a suspect says they can’t breathe ,  believe them and take measures to correct to it .
 this training is reinforced at least twice a year in our use of force training .
 these “officers” deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison .
 retired after 28 years .
 nothing less than murder .
  all the guys i worked with would never have considered doing something like that .
  you treat combative in-custodies once they’re secured as human beings .
 nothing should be personal .
  once they’ve been subdued and you are safe as an officer ,  you stand him up ,  pat him down and understand that your arrestee is at a low point in his life .
  give him some dignity and you’ll generally get his respect .
  it works 90+% of the time .
 that man was subdued and nobody should have been on him at that point .
 i’m a police officer in california .
 i am absolutely disgusted by the officers’ actions .
 when someone is in our custody you must treat them properly .
 i don’t care if they are arrested for murder or forgery .
 they are a human with a story and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect .
 i had tears streaming down my face watching the video of george floyd .
 we swore to protect our communities and that’s what we set out to do everyday .
 putting a knee into the neck of a handcuffed man for an extended period of time isn’t protecting .
 a man has lost his life due to the gross negligence of an evil person .
 may he rest in peace .
 there are a 1000 reasons why this shouldn &apos;t have happened .
 simple ,  easy ,  steps that should have been taken .
 lessons that policing has learned over the past 200 years and basic things taught in every academy .
 make no mistake ,  this was murder .
 maybe not premeditated murder ,  but nonetheless murder .
 i will be angry if those officers do not get indicted .
 didn &apos;t the same happen in new york a few years ago with eric garner being put in a choke hold
 i was a cop in the military .
 in the police academy this was one of the things the taught us not to do as it could crush the wind pipe .
 the only time i was ever taught to use chokes and neck holds was in combat training for deployments  .
 but when we got back we always had to attend retraining classes to relearn what we can do state side .
 sheriffs deputy here and i must say that i am disgusted by the unnecessary loss of life .
 there are moments that make me regret what i do ,  and this is one of them .
 i &apos;ve met my share of racists wearing a badge and i &apos;m ready for a career change .
 the oath we take is to uphold the law and constitution ,  so for the officers on scene there that could have stepped in and prevented this ,  fuck you .
 one bad apple always ruins the bunch ,  unfortunately .
 i pray for the george &apos;s family and that justice is served .
 throwaway for obvious reasons and yes i &apos;m a white male .
 wasn &apos;t expecting this to blowup as it has .
 im responding to you guys when i can and i &apos;m glad we can have a conversation about this .
 we do not unionize in my state for law enforcement ,  and i see many comments about systemic protection and abuse .
 i have never worked under a police union ,  but i have worked with people who were unionized and i have heard my share of stories where le is protected by the union ( stories i hear are about union protection from bad leadership ) but i can imagine those protection s may extend further in cases such as this .
 as a son of a former police officer ,  my dad worked really hard to be an honest cop .
 his department was full of racists .
 they didn’t like him because he was a decent cop ,  they couldn’t do anything wrong on front of him .
 we saw the news together and i saw him wipe a tear ,  but tried really hard to hide it .
 i know he’s sad and i don’t wanna push him to talk about it ,  but we both know things like this is always gonna happen ,  and that is a really sad fact .
 i can’t possibly understand why a human being would do something like this
 federal bureau but am not a local police officer .
 all 4 cops need to go to jail .
 derek chauvin ,  the cop with the knee on george &apos;s neck ,  should &apos;ve gone to jail long ago .
 the guy apparently has a history of doing this .
 this is his third time in 15 years .
 black people need to keep fighting and white/asian/latino people need to support them .
 justice for cases like this won &apos;t come easy ,  and it won &apos;t come soon .
 but if they keep fighting ,  i truly believe that one day ,  eventually ,  it will come .
 it disgusts me as the job is difficult enough as it is ,  working mostly in sensitive neighborhoods .
 brutality like this makes it far more difficult .
 serious question to the police officers participating in this discussion ,  obviously there are a myriad of factors that possibly contributed to this incident ,  from poor training ,  to an officer being unfit for duty ,  etc .
 my question is ,  how is it possible that the three other officers on the scene took no steps to intervene ,  or at the very least ,  check on the status of the victim ?
 is there any reason for their lack of awareness or decision to stand aside while they ,  along with many other bystanders ,  can clearly see the man dying in front of them ?
 what justification ,  if any ,  is possible in this situation ?
 ah ,  a post i can finally answer !
 based in scotland ,  i &apos;m a police officer with 5 years service ,  2 of which i have been a part-time officer safety instructor .
 during this training we go over retraining subjects and handcuff techniques that we use to a t .
  this includes all safety aspects including where to apply handcuffs ,  how tight they should be ,  ensuring the technique is done correctly and that the subject is in a controlled but safe position .
 positional asphyxia is a vital topic we cover and it is reiterated time and time again that if a subject ends up on the ground we never ,  and i reiterate again ,  never ,  place any sort of weight on them .
 hell even when sitting in the back of our cars ,  we watch them and ensure they can breath and are in a comfortable position for transport .
 what these cops did was just plain stupid ,  disproportionate and frankly an embarrassment to policing .
  i &apos;d also use disgusting if i &apos;m honest .
 i just hope that people know we are not like this .
 this is my first comment and it has received more attention that i could have imagined ,  which i thank you all for !
 to address some points raised in the replies .
  i appreciate i work in a far different environment but we still have to restrain subjects while cuffed and at no point has it resulted in an incident like this or even an officer in the position shown in the video .
 i absolutely condemn his actions and this should never have happened .
  as for what was going on his head ,  i have no idea whether it be  &apos;red mist &apos; or he thought something else .
  either way he should lose his job and face the full consequences of his action .
 unfortunately some hate ,  as expected ,  in some replies which i understand .
  however one officer cannot be held accountable for another ,  so again i hope people understand that this a small minority of the job and the rest are always there to help .
  stay safe folks .
 disgusted ,  especially by the frequency of these events .
 glad that i work in a place where we &apos;re trained for years before we ever put on a uniform that communication is our greatest tool .
 sad to know that this is going to happen again and again .
 i have a degree in law enforcement and work in corrections in minnesota .
 my thoughts are  &apos;fuck that guy .
  &apos; nobody is taught to put their knee on a guy &apos;s neck and leave it there until he passes out and dies .
 he may has well have had his hands around the man &apos;s neck .
 if i were to go off the video evidence ,  the officer should be arrested for murder .
 i &apos;d put a serious tag if i were you .
 when i went through the academy in 1990 ,   i had to complete 480 hours of basic mandate training .
 at that time  ,  someone who wanted to be a hairstylist had to complete 2400 hours of training .
  that might be one of the issues as mentioned previously .
 my roommate &apos;s only been a cop for a few years ,  but he got into a huge rant about how that is not how you choke someone in a way to detain them .
 the cop should be tried in court for manslaughter at the very least ,  and if they think they can make a case for murder ,  go for it .
 i &apos;m british but live in america .
 there is such a different mindset to policing back home in my experience ,  albeit i grew up in the countryside and lived in a quiet city .
 my friend is an officer today and he was trained to use his words ,  not his weapons on first instinct .
 he said you are supposed to police by consent .
 it &apos;s police service ,  not force after all .
 i know hot fuzz is a comedy but when simon pegg tells nick frost his most important tool is his logbook it &apos;s so true .
 i never feared the police when we were out and about back home .
 probably because your average bobby doesn &apos;t have a gun .
 in america ,  i &apos;m not so sure i have that same confidence .
 those that join the police to wield power and fear need to be rooted out .
 those that stand by and say nothing of their colleagues who do wrong also need to be gone .
 regardless of the act committed ,  you just don &apos;t od that to people .
 i seriously question the culture on that team .
 since some people are being a bit dense .
 i am from another continent (yes other countries exist)  .
 yes i have publicly declared my feelings for this incident on other social media (where my name actually shows) .
 no i won &apos;t do it on here ,  because if we have social media accounts with out names on them ,  they must confirm to our regulations and therefor i have .
 i place to express myself as a cop and a person at the same time .
 no ,  i don &apos;t care if you don &apos;t like that .
 when you have someone in custody you are responsible for their safety and well being .
 former police officer here .
 it &apos;s honestly scary that things like this happen .
 in the academy (training varies state by state) they teach you ppct (pressure point control tactics ?
 ppct are pretty much techniques you can use to subdue someone without actually harming them permanently (pain compliance) .
 anytime you perform a technique to incapacitate someone - you cuff the ,  sit them up  and make sure they are physically ok and have suffered no damage .
 one of the things i learned in the academy (2016) is that training between the 1900 &apos;s to now is vastly different .
 back then it was minimal training (could be a couple days ,  two weeks ,  etc) and when i went through it was about 600+ hours .
 last i heard it was 850+ .
 post mandates x amount of training (while employed) per year to maintain your post license .
 if you have a police officer from the 1980 &apos;s (example number) that graduated with 100 hours of training ,  he doesn &apos;t get the same training that you get today .
 he gets to keep working with his 100 hours + yearly acquired amount of training required by post .
 there &apos;s no reason for this to have happen .
 to clarify ,  any time a police has ended someone &apos;s life - (most ,  if not all) departments suspend them with pay and investigate to see if it was justified and if the officer is ok after the event .
 my condolences goes out to floyd and his family .
 i have to ask this as an infantry war veteran for the us .
 why are police officers not held to the same standard as our troops ?
 if i were to fire upon or kill an innocent bystander in a war zone i would go to prison for murder .
 how is it that police officers do not suffer the same repercussions ?
 it simply does not make sense .
 murder by positional asphyxiation .
 my uncle is a retired police officer ,  and i called him about this: .
 he said that it &apos;s horrible that people like this exist .
 it &apos;s has a negative impact on both the police community and the black community .
 it stirs up animosity between the two ,  and they end up not trusting .
 what if a person in the african american community needs to call the police ,  but don &apos;t trust them/fear them ?
 not all police officers are like this ,  many are great people ,  but the growing number of cases is alarming .
 another problem is that because of police unions ,  officer who should face serious reprecussions ,  aren &apos;t .
 former correctional officer .
 once they are in cuffs ,  as long as they &apos;re not spitting ,  flailing about ,  or otherwise being extremely aggressive ,  that &apos;s a no go .
 even if they are doing the aforementioned ,  that &apos;s still a no go .
 yes ,  restrain them ,  but humanely .
 sit them down or lay them on their side ,  but never apply deadly force once they &apos;re in cuffs .
 doesn &apos;t matter if the individual is yelling threats ,  slander ,  or being an asshat .
 ya just don &apos;t do it .
 when i was in training ,  we studied the use of force continuum like it was scripture .
 everyday was a scenario .
 everyday there were  &apos;pop quizzes &apos; .
 every day ,  we talked about it ,  discussed it ,  and made sure we all knew what it meant ,  what it was ,  and the proper techniques .
 once they &apos;re in cuffs ,  that &apos;s it .
 no strikes ,  holds ,  or anything more than maintaining contact .
 charge em all ,  lock em up ,  throw away the key .
 charge the department for lack of training .
 launch a 3rd party ia investigation into what happened ,  as well as into the ia department .
 chances are ,  there &apos;s a fuck ton of corruption .
 size of the force shouldn &apos;t matter when it comes to proper training .
 at what point do citizens become empowered to do the right thing ?
 as i watched this video ,  i got filled with so much hate .
 not just for the officer with the knee on this throat ,  but also for the cop standing there doing nothing .
 being a decent human being and tell your partner to chill the fuck out .
 not only for the reason that we are being recorded ,  but because it &apos;s the right thing to do .
 going back to the empowered citizens .
 as i watched i just felt like someone should &apos;ve done something .
 and not just something stupid ,  but as one human to another ,  the right thing .
 his death could &apos;ve been avoided .
 and i know that if someone would &apos;ve done something they too would &apos;ve been arrested or worse for  &apos;interfering with a police investigation &apos; that &apos;s their fuckin cop out .
 pun not intended .
 thanks for taking the time to read my comment and for replying .
 i did think about what most of you said before posting ,  but man with that video evidence ,  i’m sure 30 days probation or something not as drastic would’ve been the result and maybe a human life would’ve been saved .
 or it would have been much worse .
 i worked as an intern at a state police intelligence operations center .
 there was always tv &apos;s with the news on .
 i particularly remember when that ups driver was caught in the crossfire of a needless firefight with police officers and runaways on the highway .
 even in an instance like that the cops i worked with said the same old tropes ,   &apos;what happened before this .
  &apos; and  &apos;the media only covers the bad stuff that happens with cops what about black on black crime .
  &apos; all the garbage you always hear after this happen right from the mouth of the horse in their state hq .
 so to all the  &apos;cops of reddit &apos; i see on this thread that are saying this is shameful and whenever it happens y &apos;all are ashamed and find it disgusting .
 then hold each other accountable because in the police hq i worked at the culture that allows these things to happen was readily apparent .
 the experience i had at that internship made me drop any notion of a career in intel and law enforcement because the culture was based on victimization of cops and racism .
 deputy sheriff here .
 i was horrified and couldn’t believe my eyes .
 there’s an arrest technique to have your foot up against the shoulder/neck with your knee is across the top of their back ,  but never on the neck .
 that’s just to gain control until you cuff .
 having your knee on someone’s neck makes no sense at all ,  especially for that long .
 my department always has refresher training on positional asphyxiation and excited delirium .
 this should have never happened .
 he’s cuffed ,  get him in the car and be done with it .
 it’s the cops that pull crap like this that make the job harder and harder .
 they deserve everything they got coming to them .
 we have an obligation to to protect life and they all failed .
 some cops seriously take the job too seriously and do stupid things .
 i just want to go to work ,  go home ,  and feed my family .
 i will chime in here .
 i agree with the retired officer .
  policing in communities where there often is legitimate reasons to not trust the police ,  well ,  it’s hard .
 you do a lot to not get in over your head .
 you need to be fair and human !
 as far as police brutality .
 good cops who want to stay good need to buck up and report bad behavior in their fellow officers .
 you know what matters more than my job or career ,  the responsibility to the public !
 once i responded to a call of a black male being belligerent in public .
 turns out the male was younger ,  drunk ,  and trying to gain entry to his own residence .
 sure ,  if you want a stat you can maybe get disorderly conduct ,  but that is unnecessary .
 the truth and discretion dictated an easy fix here .
 another alpha male type officer showed up .
 he begins to rile up the drunk male .
 he is being aggressive to the male for no reason .
 it was totally immature .
 i turn around and when i go back i see the male is in handcuffs and then i see the alpha male cop picking the black male up by his neck about a foot off the ground .
 neighbors are watching ,  everyone has a camera .
 but beyond this you must be fair and moral .
 this officer was an idiot .
 i had to report it and the officer was disciplined and eventually fired i believe .
 i was a young officer and was nervous .
 you know you can make enemies even when you are right .
 well i would do that all again .
 bad behavior is not to be accepted .
 it’s one reason i’m not in policing now .
 those cops should be buried under the jail .
 i condemn all 4 of those officers actions and hope they get what they deserve .
 i am in law enforcement and i have yet to meet an officer that didn’t cringe and wonder what the actual fuck was happening .
 everyone i know in the law enforcement community not only feels terrible for this man and his family ,  but also feels discouraged and disheartened by how much fuel this adds to an already difficult to control fire of distrust in the community .
 there are officers that work day in and day out to try and fix the image and perception of policing because they care .
 these heinous abuses of power make their jobs harder .
 it’s impossible to heal a wound that keeps getting ripped open .
 it doesn’t take law enforcement training to know and understand that when you apply pressure to someone’s neck ,  you’re blocking off blood to their brain and air to their lungs .
 this wasn’t just a case of bad training .
 this was a case of lack of basic humanity .
 not a peace officer ,  but i work in a jail ,  for an so in a different state .
 not only at the dipshit who used a technique that even jailers are explicitly taught never to do ,  but also at the jackass who stood there and did nothing .
 we have a very strict tap-out rule ,  when engaged in a use of force so that if you see someone losing control ,  or just blatantly disregarding training/sop ,  you should tap them out of the situation .
 this didn’t happen .
 he didn’t even try .
 neither did the other 2 who the video doesn’t show .
 i really hope he gets charged and convicted .
 2nd degree murder for chauvin ,  misconduct of a public officer at a minimum for all 4 ,  and the other 3 who’s names i do not know should get whatever the accessory to murder equivalent is in mn .
 the accessory charges may not stick ,  but the charges should be filed as a statement .
 i also think that the 3 officers not stepping up points to an agency issue that needs to be addressed .
 in this job you should never feel that you can’t voice a concern to a superior/more veteran officer/anyone .
 administrative concerns have a method .
 life saftey concerns should not .
 the chief is fairly new ,  but is a long time mpd officer and may not be able to fix the problem .
 if i did this shit in iraq i would have gone to leavenworth .
 think about that
 alternatively: cops of reddit ,  when you see your colleagues and brothers in blue doing heinous shit ,  what do you do to intervene and take a stand ,  to get rid of the so-called bad apples ?
 this may get buried by all the comments by non-police officers ,  but i am a us police officer in a decent-sized city (population of about 500 , 000) .
  i am proud of my career and my department .
 i think my department is lucky to have pretty strong support in our community .
 support comes from trust that when a citizen has to come in contact with the police in some way ,  they will be treated with respect .
 regardless of what kind of training those officers had or lacked ,  no one with common sense or good intentions would kneel on someone’s neck ,  especially after they’d been handcuffed ,  while they stated multiple times that they couldn’t breathe .
 at no point in the academy was i taught that knee-to-the-neck was an appropriate hold for a suspect .
 in fact ,  i was taught about positional asphyxiation .
 and that a “choke hold” or carotid restraint that cuts off circulation to the brain is deadly force .
 when a combative suspect is handcuffed and is no longer able to hurt you ,  you sit them up and call for medical if they were injured during the arrest .
 i have made and assisted with many ,  many arrests and nothing i saw in the george floyd video is normal .
 i can’t even fathom what that officer was thinking .
 as far as the officers standing by ,  helping to hold mr .
 floyd down ,  and failing to intervene when he says he can’t breathe .
 my department’s policy says that officers shall intervene if they are witnessing a fellow officer using excessive force .
 regardless of whether the officer using excessive force is a 30 year vet and the witness is a rookie .
 if it’s a sergeant and the witness is his/her subordinate .
 these are people’s lives at stake and police officers have too much power if we aren’t willing to police each other .
 i rarely make judgments on fellow officers without knowing the whole story ,  but the video of george floyd’s arrest is enough .
 floyd was murdered and those officers had every opportunity to change the outcome of that situation .
 they are not worthy of their badge .
 i’m relieved that their department was decisive enough to immediately fire them and i fully expect they will be prosecuted .
 i’ve seen many people commenting ,  “why don’t police officers speak up ?
 ” and “why do the police continue to participate in this corruption ?
 ” we aren’t ‘participating’ .
 if we stop showing up to work and doing our jobs ,  violence and crime will rule .
 i haven’t talked to a single officer who isn’t disgusted by what happened in minneapolis .
 i’m incredibly angry because the actions of those cops put a target on every other cop’s back - good cops who would never ,  ever do something like that .
 the law enforcement community as a whole is in agreement that george floyd’s death was completely unacceptable and unnecessary .
 if anyone bothered to read this ,  please don’t condemn all police because of the actions of those few .
 there’s no excuse for it ,  but the vast majority of police officers are truly good people .
 rioting to the point that property is destroyed and people get hurt doesn’t help anything .
 your empathy gives me hope .
 very well written ,  thank you for your service and for taking the time to write this .
 this should have more upvotes  .
 the sword part has me curious
 assault on a police officer ,  obstruction of justice ,  and probably resisting arrest (depending on state laws of course)  that gets tossed in as an easy one to charge ,  but usually gets pled off in court .
 also ,  what would happen to a cop if they intervened or pushed the cop off of him ?
 they would more than likely be charged with obstruction and maybe aggravated battery of a p .
 but i feel it 100% would have gotten the officer off his neck .
 no charges because that person would be dead
 there is no police academy training officers to kneel on someone &apos;s neck to subdue them ,  that &apos;s how you kill a person .
 this is why it &apos;s quite apparent the officer had intent to end the guy &apos;s life .
  any sane person ,  officer or not ,  would not have wanted to kill someone over what that guy did in the last 10 minutes of interaction .
  the officer had the eyes of someone who wouldn &apos;t think twice about the value of the man he &apos;s causing to lose consciousness .
 that &apos;s the part that gets to me .
  his fellow officers did nothing .
 i have a friend who was in the police force .
  he had been at the hospital visiting a fellow officer dying of cancer ,  then went on shift .
  he was trying to get some kids to leave an area they were in illegally and these children were being verbally aggressive and physically by snapping wet towels at him .
  in a momentary lapse of reason ,  he pulled his gun .
 i &apos;ve watched the video .
  as soon as his gun came out ,  three officers were there pushing his hand down and saying no .
  he put the gun away ,  turned around ,  went home and resigned .
  bad day ,  bad decision ,  he knew he had fucked up .
  you could see the instant he realized how screwed he was and realized how badly he screwed up .
 but ,  if his fellow officers hadn &apos;t stepped in ?
  would his anger have been enough to shoot a teenager ?
  we &apos;ll never know because his fellow officers did the right thing .
 couldn’t have said it any better .
 i sat in on a few deescalation refreshers when i briefly worked for my hometown pd right after the devan guildford shooting ,  and the training officers were heavily beating the drum about how the fact that in that case (as in this one) the officer had dozens of chances to prevent the outcome .
 do you think this is going to become a major training module ?
 i’m so happy to see a response like yours .
 simple question ,  was there danger to officers or the public ?
 no ,  not even close .
 i get split second decisions like you said but this is a fucking atrocity .
 4-5 officers on scene ,  combatant restrained ,  officer kneeling in his neck .
 if you’re in a bad part of town and have to subdue a combatant individual .
 you do what you can .
 this officer was in a 400% position of power and killed him ( likely because of ego or being a power hungry person) .
 it was so overly unnecessary .
 it’s reassuring to hear this .
 any suggestions on how employment screening could be improved to avoid letting people like this join the ranks and tarnish the reputation of all the good cops ?
 makes it harder to protect communities when you lose the trust of the public .
 these situations hurt you all unfortunately .
 honest question (and i’m not saying that you don’t already do this) ,  but how come more good cops like you are not vocal about this ?
 he &apos;s apparently been involved in at least 2 other deaths including shooting a fleeing suspect in the back .
 i dunno given that history premeditation seems reasonable .
 create a petition .
 get other leo &apos;s to put their fucking name and county/city on the list and say you agree with indictment of another leo .
 all the cops got off .
 current sheriff &apos;s deputy from the midwest here ,  it &apos;s a constant point emphasized in defensive tactics training that you don &apos;t choke someone or go for the neck .
 unless the suspect has the upper hand and your curtains are closing and it &apos;s your last resort to survive .
 obviously that wasn &apos;t the situation here .
 thank you for letting us know the police officers in other places don’t do that .
 police in hong kong do that .
 let me give you one recent example .
 a police office put down lawmaker roy kwong and kneed down on his neck because the police thought he threw a water bottle  which he never did .
 people in hong kong are facing this problem for almost a year now .
 its amazing that time and time again you see military saying this is exactly not what to do but for some reason the civilian trainers seem to forget to teach the same .
  would i rather be a pow to an american soldier vs american cop i &apos;ll take soldier every time .
 and if not the windpipe it could damage or put pressure on the carotid artery .
 which can cause a drop in blood pressure (with unconsciousness and possible death as a result) ,  stroke ,  heart attack and/or a number of other serious issues related to circulation .
 everyone was pretty adamant (regardless if it was military or civilian security) that if you go for the neck you &apos;re going for the kill .
 wether that is with a buttstock ,  barrel ,  bayonet or your bare hands .
 they might survive ,  but it was not something you should expect .
 what might be  &apos;that super cool trick where you can make someone black out in less than 15 seconds &apos; on a young and healthy military guard might be deadly on someone with arterial plaques ,  heart issues or just a birth defect .
 see ,  people say things like  &apos;not all cops are bad &apos; but based on what i &apos;ve read in this sub a lot of good cops quit because they get tired of the corruption and racism .
 the law enforcement system seems to filter out the good guys and the jerks are overrepresented .
 just cuz there are racist police officers doesn’t mean you should give up .
 stay strong ,  because otherwise then there is just one less good police officer
 my grandfather was nypd beat cop .
 passed over for promotions and refused to have a partner when he could .
  said it was because he found out that most other cops couldn &apos;t be trusted .
  he was on the force for nearly 35 years ,  from the time he got out of wwii to the early 90s .
 i &apos;ve got a lot of family history with the nypd and the fdny .
  i had 4 cousins in the nypd ,  all of them quit after saying cops are just too untrustworthy to be around .
 3 of them joined up the fdny instead .
  now i got 9 cousins (and 4 uncles) on the fdny ,  or formerly .
 yeah it &apos;s tough given the peer pressure .
  respect to people like your dad .
  when i was in the military i met a guy that worked at the sheriff &apos;s dept and he would brag how he would beat up the people in jail if they talked back .
  i can only imagine how fucked up these organizations are with all of them feeding off of each other everyday .
 the people who want to be police officers are two kinds of people .
 person a: decent human being ,  wants to help make his community a better place .
 person b: a person who thinks being an officer means he has the power to control others and do as they please .
 person a is harder to find because the job has inherent dangers that other jobs don &apos;t have .
 for some insight on how a human could do this ,  look up the old psychology experiment where they got like 20 college students to run a prison .
 half were guards ,  half were prisoners .
 summarizing doesn’t nearly do it justice .
 but just in case you don’t want to look it up .
 basically ,  the “guards” start out pretty much fantastic .
 as you’d expect from college kids just being decent humans towards other college kids .
 but then they do things like “dropping” the food trays (i think .
 it’s been a long time since i saw a video on this) ,  so the prisoners would have to eat their food off the floor .
 then they got physically abusive and stuff .
 and i believe they had to end the experiment early (possibly even a month early or something ,  but my memory is total shit so don’t quote me on that) .
 because the guard students got too abusive towards their fellow students .
 basically ,  the most clear example of “power corrupts ,  absolute power corrupts absolutely .
 ” (though ,  to be fair ,  i’m not sure the students had an actual warden or internal affairs or anything that’s supposed to help get rid of abusive guards and stuff .
 but that wasn’t exactly the point of the experiment .
 it wasn’t meant to perfectly simulate a prison .
 it was meant to see what the power and authority would do to regular people .
 and it did exactly what it was intended to do .
 my former local precinct .
 they did nothing except eat pizza and hang out at the gas station across from where this happened .
 they whole precinct needs to be investigated .
 they were never bothered with doing their job .
 he &apos;s killed 3 people in 15 years ?
 it was fucking embarrassing going out the day after something like this happened .
 i find it odd the police union itself never seems to feel this same sense of embarrassment about severe misconduct
 that &apos;s the thing about good cops .
 they theoretically exist ,  but they very rapidly become former cops .
 i remember hearing that in my city ,  we have a shortage of police officers because no one wants a part of that .
 and honestly i can’t blame them .
 who wants to be in what is likely the most hated job on the planet ?
 how difficult was it for you to build community trust ?
 did you have to continuously fight against atrocities such as the recent cases ,  or was your community more sheltered from those issues ?
 you could call 911 and ask for a supervisor to go on scene .
 but there very well could have been a sgt on scene since iirc there were 4 officers there already .
 at the minimum you called 911 and the call was recorded and noted .
 as black guy ,  ive been asking myself this a lot .
 i mean could you imagine pushing the cop off the guy ,  and saving floyd &apos;s life ?
 but then being tackled down by the cop &apos;s partner and the best case scenario is you get arrested for assaulting an officer .
 worst case scenario ,  they use lethal force on you in self-defense .
 we &apos;re damned if we do ,  and damned if we don &apos;t .
 i hope there’s an answer to this .
 my exact thought .
 if that cop was willing to kill one person why think he wouldn’t do something drastic to a bystander trying to help .
 edit- reading through replies it seems there’s no great answer .
 you either commit a crime yourself and risk the same fate or you call the next level of police and hope it’s not too late .
 i think this is an important place to start with in reform .
 there needs to be immediate legal action that can be taken if you feel a police officer is threatening someone’s life .
 life is precious and we have to do better .
 if you tackle an officer murdering a person and the person lives ,  you are either going to be murdered in the moment or going to jail for a year and your life will be ruined .
 if you tackle an officer murdering a person and the person dies because you were too late ,  you are either going to be murdered in the moment or going to jail for a few months while your case gets repealed and your life will be ruined .
 it &apos;s a reverse pascal &apos;s fuck the police .
 maybe if people do what the black panthers used to do .
 they would patrol neighborhoods with a lot of weapons on them and when they saw people getting areested and such they would just watch and not interfere .
 the fact that there were armed people nearby discouraged abusive behavior by police .
 something big is going to happen eventually in a situation like this and it &apos;s not going to be a pretty moment for our society .
 i follow a police officer who does a lot of post action reviews and other materials in regards to shootings ,  prevention ,  and in particular this issue .
 this was his post this morning in regards to this exact question .
  &apos;watching a murder .
 i had a friend send me a message this morning .
 he wanted to know how a bystander might intervene in a situation like what happened in minneapolis .
 how does one safely intervene when cops are mistreating a prisoner ?
 violent action won &apos;t help .
 you will be arrested and likely beaten as well .
 if you physically attack the cop it might actually make it worse for the guy you are trying to protect .
 here &apos;s what i would do ,  keeping in mind that this is my personal opinion and not legal or tactical advice .
 i just want to give you some options so you don &apos;t have to stand there and watch someone get killed .
 as you approach ,  walk slowly with your hands in plain view .
 don &apos;t move in too close .
 you don &apos;t want the officers to see you as a threat .
 move close enough to talk to the officer ,  but not close enough to touch .
 probably the best thing to do is to approach another officer on scene who has less ego involvement rather than the kneeling dude .
 say something like:  &apos;hey officer ,  i just want to let you know that the guy on the ground appears to be suffering from a medical condition .
 i don &apos;t know if the officer controlling him knows he &apos;s kneeling on the dude &apos;s neck .
 people are videotaping and it doesn &apos;t look good .
 i just don &apos;t want you guys to get in trouble .
 if someone approached me at a similar scene in that manner ,  i would most certainly go check things out and ensure that the prisoner is ok .
 if there is no one else ,  i &apos;d approach the officer and focus on the medical issues .
  &apos;officer ,  let me help you .
 i &apos;ve had advanced medical training and that guy doesn &apos;t look so good .
 let &apos;s move him on to his side and away from the car so that he can breathe better and i &apos;ll check him out for you .
 another way that might work is  &apos;officer ,  are you ok ?
 i &apos;m a martial arts instructor .
 can i help you hold him down so that you don &apos;t have to kneel on his neck ?
 just tell me what you want me to do and i &apos;ll do it .
 i think those strategies might have a high likelihood of success ,  but ultimately if the officers refuse your aid ,  there isn &apos;t much else you can do .
 as a last resort ,  i &apos;d call 911 and tell the dispatchers that the officers on scene are in danger of killing their prisoner and request that both a supervisor and an ambulance respond to the scene .
 i &apos;d say that might have a 50/50 chance of working depending on who the boss is and how busy they are .
 i mean if a concealed carrier shot that cop to save the george’s life ,  id support him .
 but would the law be on his side ?
 not a cop ,  but the only thing i can think of would be to live stream it and tell them you &apos;re doing so .
 this needs to be higher ,  because we all know what happens if you shoved a cop off of a guy he was killing: you’d both end up catching your own lead ,  or taking a knee to the neck long enough to pass out and die .
 you &apos;re question points out the root of the problem .
 in the usa ,  police have ultimate omnipotent power over everything and everyone ,  except for judges in court .
 so basically ,  police can do whatever they want .
 we can &apos;t stop them while it &apos;s happening .
 our only option is to let them have their way and do what they want .
 then ,  long after the fact ,  we have to try and fight what they did with a judge; and that &apos;s if they case even gets to court .
 the usa police system is broken .
 i want police to feel empowered to do their job and protect and keep the peace ,  but police should also feel restricted in that they also have to follow a code of conduct .
 as a citizen ,  i know that i better not assault an office because i will get severe punishment .
 officers should know that if they feel they need to take someone &apos;s life ,  they better have a damn good reason .
 every time an officer kills someone ,  they should have to explain and speak to the reason of the killing to a judge .
 if you &apos;re an officer and feel your life is in danger ,  fine ,  shoot him ,  but just know that you will need to justify that every time you do it or be charged with murder .
 if a police feels they need to kill someone they better be damn sure they have good evidence to explain to the judge .
 just like if someone breaks into my house .
 i can shoot that person ,  but i will have to explain myself and prove that it was necessary .
 police should have to do the same every single time they kill someone .
 ianap ,  but i expect the real answer is  &apos;nothing &apos; .
 you could shout ,  you could plead - but the moment you get physical ,  or even threatening ,  there are going to be guns on you .
 what are we supposed to do ?
 they &apos;re murdering a man right in front of you and they have guns ,  and they &apos;re the people who are supposed to protect you .
 i know cops aren &apos;t here to protect us .
 i &apos;m talking about public perception .
 edit 2: if it wasn &apos;t abudantly clear already ,  acab
 yeah ,  like if we yell at the cops in their face to stop will they taser us or i guess murder us ?
 ex tribal officer - fuck if i know !
 we all had our heated moments but you learn to tag out other officers when you need to .
 if someone is getting upset ,  you tap them ,  whisper the you &apos;ll take it and to take a breather ,  and now you have a fresh calm perspective .
 that other cops should have tapped out his partner instead of standing there like a slackjawed moron .
 thao ,  the other officer shown in the video ,  has a well established history of police brutality .
 he literally stopped a random guy ,  handcuffed him ,  and beat the shit out of him .
 he was fired from the force once already .
 you know how people say one bad apple spoils the bunch ?
 welcome to minneapolis .
 half of our police are festering garbage covered in maggots .
 look up footage of how mpd officers treated protestors .
 theres plenty of people who are just as bad as thao and chauvin who just haven &apos;t gotten caught on tape yet .
 this isn &apos;t  &apos;oh no ,  these 3 not bad cops refused to itnervene on a bad cop &apos; .
 they are all bad cops .
 i wouldn &apos;t call myself a local to the neighborhood ,  but i &apos;m not stranger .
 i &apos;ve lived and worked in south minneapolis .
 i &apos;ve stood at that corner dozens of times .
 i &apos;ve shopped in that store doezens of times .
 my job is like 5 minutes down the street from that police station .
 i know i &apos;ve repeatedly interacted with thao specifically (probably chauvin too ,  but he &apos;s much more generic looking so i cant be sure) .
 there are good cops here .
 but there are so many bad cops and just mediocre/apathetic/lazy cops .
 good cops are definitely the minority .
 there are good cops here .
 i &apos;ve seen them .
 i &apos;ve seen the cops who squat down to get on the same eye level as the person in cuffs and talk them down so they calm down .
 i &apos;ve seen them explain what they &apos;re doing and why .
 i &apos;ve seen them use force and immediately back away once the person is restrained .
 i &apos;ve seen them have an actual conversation with the person instead of shouting commands ,  they actually ask questions .
 but those cops are fucking rare .
 mostly it &apos;s a cop antogonizing someone while a couple other cops stand a few couple feet back .
 50/50 chance the cops standing back are snickering to eachother .
 what we saw on video is par for the course in south minneapolis (that &apos;s the only area i &apos;m familiar enough with i feel comfortable to speak on .
 there &apos;s other spots that don &apos;t have great reputations either though .
 ) the only difference is that this chokehold went on longer and someone died .
 but everything else - that &apos;s not exactly rare to see once you start looking around
 i worked with military police .
 the answer is that the only  &apos;truly wrong &apos; thing you can do is contradict another police officer .
 so long as everyone &apos;s story is the same ,  no matter how bullshit it is ,  the department can cover it up .
 visited scotland a couple years ago and loved it .
 most jarring thing on the whole trip was walking into the glasgow airport to fly back to the us and seeing cops with assault rifles standing near the escalators .
 didn &apos;t run into any cops during the rest of my time there ,  but had in the back of my head that they &apos;re typically not armed .
 i guess airports are a special threat environment .
 do they do any simulations on other trainees on cuffs then sat upon ?
 it would be a great way to show them how uncomfortable it is to be in that position
 as a baltimore resident ,  do you think it &apos;s just the sheer size of the force that lets these situations continue to happen ?
 i don &apos;t envy the officers who have to essentially work in a warzone ,  but sometimes it feels like there &apos;s no light at the end of our tunnel for making the city safer and for ending police corruption and misconduct
 thanks for your reply .
 i appreciate hearing your sentiments .
 are you an officer in the usa ?
 if so ,  mind sharing the city ?
 i was under the impression it was typically 6 months of training in the us ,  but recently saw some other countries have a few years or more .
 thanks for your your thoughts .
 it seems like most officers have had training pertaining to positional asphyxiation when they have someone in hand cuffs .
 can you elaborate on that at all ?
 if you saw your coworker doing something similar ,  what course of action do you take ?
 that &apos;s the crazy thing about this case: it couldn &apos;t be more blatant .
 the footage was clear ,  long-lasting and heart wrenching .
 if there isn &apos;t hell to pay with this clear of evidence then protests are absolutely justified .
 all of them present should be arrested for murder .
 they actively prevented others from intervening despite being told multiple times how serious the situation was .
 so yes they all are guilty .
 there is a difference between what they deserve and what can be reasonable proven .
 i speaking about what they deserve .
 i dunno ,  i don’t think it’s sort of thing people joke about .
  that said ,  i reckon there’ll be a lot of “not a police officer but .
  &apos;policed by consent &apos; is something that was drummed into me by my history/law teacher .
  the entire ethos of policing is different here .
 i’m american and i lived in the uk for a year and couldn’t agree more .
 police in england were genuinely friendly and helpful .
 they’d drive drunk college kids home if they missed their bus .
 one time they got called on a noise complaint to a house party i was at .
 they came in all serious being like “we’ve received a noise complaint .
 but i fucking love this song” and stayed to dance with us for a minute .
 people were even smoking joints nearby and they just told us to keep it down and left .
 back in the us ,  i avoid interacting with the police at all costs .
 they’ve assaulted my mentally ill brother ,  threatened to hold me in jail if i didn’t give a statement ,  lied constantly ,  etc .
 immigrated from uk to us a few years back and the first thing i mentioned feeling different about to my wife was the low level nervousness i have around american police that i just didn &apos;t have around uk officers .
 even just going through processing after landing it seemed like they were eager to believe i was there with ulterior motives .
 it &apos;s hard to accurately describe the difference though because it &apos;s lots of little things like body language and demeanor but absolutely a completely different gut feeling .
 the other officers standing around couldn’t care less what he was doing .
 he died in the middle of 3 other officers and bystanders .
 their team is entirely fucked .
 i don &apos;t understand .
 if someone is cuffed how much damage/harm can they possibly be ?
 are the that much  &apos;safer &apos; to deal with pinned down ?
 i guess i &apos;m asking what &apos;s the point of keeping someone pinned if they are detained ?
 why not throw them in the cruiser ?
 why don &apos;t we see police officers or departments come out and condemn things like this when they happen ?
 i was on a police subreddit yesterday and most people seemed to agree with you ,  and stressing that this is less common than the media would have us believe .
 it was basically boiled down to  &apos;yeah this is bad ,  the media jumps on it and the police are not set up to fight a pr battle with the media &apos; .
 i understand that argument ,  but when so many people agree that what happened is wrong ,  wouldn &apos;t it be a good move to stand up and say  &apos;we do not condone this &apos; as an organization .
 it &apos;s a really bad look when they stay quiet or as is the case most of time ,  back up the officer in question .
 it &apos;s like if there was a problem with mailmen stealing packages ,  i would expect the post office to fire them ,  have them arrested ,  and let the public know that it won &apos;t be tolerated .
 we see police unions support politicians for election ,  but we never see them come together to condemn this sort of thing .
 it &apos;s just a really bad look for all the good cops out there and i wonder why they don &apos;t speak up more often .
 yet 3 other cops sat there and did nothing
 growing number of videos .
 we don’t know how many cases were hushed up or ignored before there were so many people with cameras in their pocket
 i would be more worried that the cops would kill me too .
 that &apos;s a pretty legit reason to hesitate .
 don &apos;t get me wrong ,  i would love to say i would just jump in and save the guy but ,  no one knows how they will react when in that situation .
 you would need to take out 4 cops before getting shot .
 they would’ve killed anyone who approached that cop .
 probably because the officers all have guns at the ready .
 all it takes is one shot and saying it was self defence .
 asking a lot to interfere when the dude is clearly not right and has a gun ready to go
 those officers were armed and obviously prepared to kill for no good reason .
 you realized when people did start getting closer and approaching the cop pulled out his mace ready to spray right ?
 maybe watch the video over .
 civilians tried to intervene but once people get to close they get to hurt because cops feel threatened when all the people want to do is help the person that can’t breathe .
 i really wonder what would have happened if someone stood up to the officers at that moment .
 probably would have been shot .
 house that we frequent because of domestic issues .
 grandma keeps allowing the kids ,  i say kids but they are in their 20 &apos;s ,  to move back in .
 the grandkids then take advantage of grandma and steal her stuff to sell for meth .
 grandma refuses to not let them back because she says it is against her mexican heritage .
 well one day ,  younger grandson comes back to the house and starts stealing again .
 grandma catches him and tells him to leave ,  he punches her in return .
 we get called out and i am first on scene .
 when i arrived ,  the only information i had was he was refusing to leave ,  i did not know about the physical violence yet .
 i also missed the part where dispatch let us know he had a gun because i was exiting my unit and putting my ear piece in .
 as i walked up to the home ,  i knocked and then i could hear him on the other side saying  &apos;i &apos;m not going back to jail ,  they &apos;re going to have to kill me .
  &apos; this is generally a clue that someone is psyching themselves up to fight .
 i backed off to give myself some room in case i needed to get cover .
 dispatch readvised he possibly has a gun and i looked around for more substantial cover but i was stuck in the relative open .
 he answers the door and is obviously strung out on meth with brass knuckles in hand .
 he recognizes me and i ask him to please put the knuckles down and he does .
 i then noticed there was a hammer ,  an axe ,  and the knuckles all easily within arms reach .
 i have no clear view of what is behind him and i can see a bulge in his waist band .
 i do my best to keep him calm and tell him that i was just there to talk ,  and obviously if i had immediate plans to take him to jail he would be in cuffs .
 he is calming down but still refusing to step outside .
 after a couple of minutes ,  he can hear the sirens of my backup coming and he says  &apos;you know what ?
 fuck this &apos; ,  reaches behind him and grabs a machete which he has modified into a small sword .
 he begins moving toward me while cocking his arm back wit the machete .
 i pulled my gun and pointed it at his face and i moved forward to make my intentions clear .
 he ends up dropping the machete and pissing himself .
 at this point ,  he becomes very compliant and steps out and i find he has a bb gun in his waist band which looks like a s&w pistol ,  fake logo and all ,  and various other weapons strewn around .
 i get him cuffed and other officers finally show up on scene and check the house for any other persons while i escort him to my unit .
 as i am walking up to the unit ,  he tells me he is not going to get in my car .
 i ask him why and he says the governor wants him dead and he knows cops like to kill brown people .
 now ,  i try to use humor when i can to deescalate situations .
 i have dealt with this guy enough i know what is humorous to him .
 i tell him ,   &apos;dude ,  if i wanted to shoot you ,  i had every right to do so at the house ,  even your grandma would have called that justified .
 if i shoot you in my car ,  my chief is going to be pissed about the bloody mess i made .
  &apos; this actually succeeded in making him smile ,  agree ,  and get in my car .
 he ended up convicted for continous family violence ,  robbery ,  and the brass knuckles .
 his defense attorney ,  at trial ,  actually approached me and complimented the way i handled the situation ,  the collection of information and the report .
 told me the only reason they were even in court is because they believed grandma would refuse to testify or cooperate .
 she cooperated on this one though ,  she was done with him finally .
 i fear that if someone had intervened ,  that version of the story never would have received publicity .
  death is a much more weighty headline .
 it’s hard to intervene when there’s no visible precedent of it being effective ,  and there is a strong precedent of reactive brutality .
 i wish we had positive stories available on the news in which de-escalation worked .
 but in a similar way to flattening the curve ,  it’s so much harder to count saved lives than lost ones .
 they would never work as a cop again .
 they’d be labeled a good cop and ostracized by the rest of the department .
 i always thought it would be a cool law and order episode where a cop shoots his partner (who we know his racist from the opening scene) because he’s about to shoot an unarmed black man .
 both cops are white .
 sure ,  l&o lacks a lot of nuance and realism ,  but an interesting “what if” nonetheless .
 look up frank serpico .
 but then there &apos;s a decent chance the officer does something similar to the bystander .
 it &apos;s a awful situation to be an observer ,  because you really can &apos;t intervene without a badge .
 i ran that same scenario through in my head .
  if you could prove he was actively killing the man ,  it would have been perfectly legal to shoot the officer in his defense .
  but you &apos;d  be unlikely to survive the attempt ,  and if you did it &apos;s  a hell of an uphill battle arguing it was a legal shooting without a dead victim .
 and he mocked him as he pleaded for his life !
 today marks the first time in my 35 years that an audio recording made me physically ill .
 listening to the others present beg the officer to stop was an entire additional level of pain .
 i feel so bereft for them—knowing that intervening physically could easily end with their own deaths .
 i think the officers just didn &apos;t care because they felt superior ,  in a police - citizen way and maybe even in a racist way and this should definitely be punished
 this is just so sad and scary .
 that &apos;s a powerful story .
 thanks for sharing it .
 my father was a police officer from the time he was 18 to his mid 60s ,  and even worked his way up to becoming chief of two different departments .
 in his last month as an officer ,  he pulled over a car that matched the description of a shooter and kidnapper in the next county over (his department was on the county line) .
 the shooter let the kidnappee go and drove off at high speed .
 my father’s car had a mechanical failure and wouldn’t get into gear for a few seconds .
 in the extra time it took for my father to catch up ,  the shooter ended up having a fatal head-on collision with another car .
 my father arrived on the scene and went to perform first aid .
 the guy in the other car was killed on impact ,  his neck snapped and stretched out .
 he was a friend of ours .
 he was just a kind ,  elderly vet he had known for years .
 my pops had nightmares over this for months .
 after the impact ,  the shooter got out of his car and moved toward my dad .
  i want to reiterate this: a shooter and kidnapper who had just killed my father’s friend ,  attempted to get out and confront him .
 my pops immediately drew his gun ,  given the danger of the situation .
 a witness to this rushed over and screamed “shoot him !
 ” over and over to my dad .
 my father was a split second away from shooting already .
 i’m glad he didn’t listen .
 instead ,  he lowered his gun ,  verbally berated both the witness and the shooter ,  and got the shooter into cuffs .
 he retired within the month and still suffers from ptsd to this day .
 i’m just so glad that he didn’t listen to the man screaming to shoot .
 waiting patiently to see the autopsy report .
 i bet it has to do with a crushed trachea .
 do you think this is going to become a major training module ?
 at the moment ,  i don &apos;t see how this case can ever not be talked about in police academies going forward .
 it &apos;s such a prime example of what not to do .
 i &apos;m not a cop ,  but i think we need a new organization specifically for investigating police corruption and crime .
 this organization should have an anonymous phone number good policeman can call to report crime ,  corruption ,  racists ,  etc ,  within a local or state police force and have them investigated .
 it was but it takes time for the ambulance to get there .
 which is why you put someone complaining of breathing problems in a position other than one that causes positional asphyxiation .
 arresting someone who isn &apos;t willing to be arrested is a violent process .
 but once they &apos;re in handcuffs the hard part is over and it &apos;s time to chill out and act like a professional .
 this is very true .
 i work for a department that has a very poor history with minorities .
 that’s something i will never deny and it affects the way i approach my work every single day .
 to be honest with you ,  i’m not too sure .
 i really don’t .
 i don’t understand what mindset a police officer or any private person would be in to not step in when someone is doing something blatantly wrong ,  deadly ,  and murderous .
 i haven’t stopped thinking about this whole thing since i saw the video yesterday and it’s torn me apart .
 it completely goes against what my partner and i set out to do every day .
 that is inexcusable .
 this would certainly be great pr for law enforcement if they did something like this .
 imagine 10s of thousands of officers signing that ?
 if that &apos;s true ,  why didn &apos;t any other officer bat an eye !
  i get the  &apos;rogue cop &apos; idea ,  but none of the other officers thought this deserved even a second glance .
  they were more worried about people filming the murder than the actual murder .
 if they &apos;re not trained to do it then they &apos;re just fucking sociopaths .
 decades of no accountability
 also genuinely curious because i’m at a complete loss to how it got to this point .
 you know what’s sad is i’ve been told police agencies don’t wanna hire mps because they’re harder to retrain .
 yet time and time again we prove them wrong by being better trained in humanitarianism
 systems that reward asshole behavior (e .
 by a lack of accountability ,  by increased profits etc .
 ) produce a siginificantly higher share of assholes .
 it &apos;s like that in the police ,  it &apos;s like that in politics and it &apos;s like that in business .
 even the  &apos;karen calling the manager &apos; meme stems from that ,  here the asshole system is the flawed notion of  &apos;the customer is always right &apos; .
 that &apos;s been my understanding of the phrase - good cops do exist ,  they just don &apos;t stay cops for long (or they don &apos;t stay good for long) .
 the majority of cops are neither good nor bad; they don &apos;t actively participate in racism or brutality but they don &apos;t do much to stop it either .
 yet many of is can no longer take what comes with being an officer .
 i say all the time that i entered law enforcement with high hopes ,  good intentions and rose colored glasses .
 i left with ptsd and depression .
 i get it because it’s hard being in a position where so many people have bad experiences with people in your occupation and you know the corporate policy is not doing you any favors .
 worked in a call center for 5 years ,  even though i thought i was very good at my job in that i gave people great experiences ,  i know there were shitty people that made it worse for me and i left .
 sorry for anyone who called and didn’t get me but i couldn’t take it anymore .
 i had a great uncle who had been a police officer .
 told me once that in 20 years he only had to pull his pistol out of its holster one time on duty ,  and that was enough to take care of things .
 these days a lot of officers seem to think that whipping the guns out is step one for \all\ situations .
 fdny is the new york fire department for anyone wondering
 nobody ever made a song called fuck the firemen .
 stanford prison experiment is what the study was called .
 the students played the prisoners and guards and the psychologist was the warden ,  it only stopped when his girlfriend was like “this is fucked up” because he himself got way tooo into it .
 some of those guys are still fucked up from that experiment .
 there’s a movie and a documentary i think ,  both are very good and from what i’ve read on the study very accurate to what happened .
 in 2006 ,  derek chauvin and 5 other police officers fatally shot a man named wayne reyes ,  who was fleeing police pursuit .
 in 2008 ,  derek chauvin shot an unarmed man named ira latrell toles .
 i find it odd the police union itself never seems to feel this same sense of embarrassment about severe misconduct .
 in another thread today ,  on the subject of jeffery dalmer ,  who killed ,  raped ,  and cannibalized his victims .
 dalmer was experimenting on live victims ,  drilling holes into their brains and pouring bleach and boiling water in ,  trying to create sex slaves with no other brain function .
 at one point ,  one of his victims ,  a 14 year old boy ,  escaped from dalmer &apos;s house .
 his head had a hole drilled in it he was bleeding from .
 his anus was bleeding from being raped .
 he wasn &apos;t able to communicate (brain damage from drano) .
 ladies in the community called the police .
 the police showed up .
 dalmer caught up with them and told them the boy was 19 ,  and he was unresponsive because he go drunk after an argument .
 he showed them pictures he &apos;d taken of him raping the boy to prove they had a relationship .
 cops left the victim in the care of dalmer ,  who raped again ,  killed and cannibalized him a few hours later .
 i &apos;ll quote from the officer &apos;s wiki page: .
  &apos;the officers noticed a strange smell in dahmer &apos;s apartment ,  which was the decaying corpse of a previous victim in the bedroom ,  but made no attempt to investigate &apos; .
  &apos;the officers did not check dahmer &apos;s identification; had they done so ,  they would have discovered that dahmer was a sex offender previously convicted for molesting the 14 year old &apos;s older brother &apos; .
  &apos;their actions were widely publicized ,  including an audiotape of the officers making homophobic statements to their dispatcher and cracking jokes about having reunited the  &apos;lovers &apos; &apos; .
 they were terminated .
  &apos;both officers later appealed their termination .
 judge robert j .
 parins decided the case and ruled in favor of the officers ,  allowing them to be reinstated &apos; .
  &apos;in may 2005 ,  balcerzak was elected president of the milwaukee police association &apos; .
 a position you get elected to ,  from your fellow union members .
 this was well publicized ,  everyone knew about it ,  certainly on the force ,  if not the general public too .
 cops picked that scumbag to represent them .
 line  &apos;em up and shoot  &apos;em all far as i &apos;m concerned .
 you have to stand up for the good cops and let them be what they can be ,  by being critical of the bad cops and holding them accountable .
 i have a good friend that is a cop .
 we had a long discussion about good cops vs bad cops .
 i made the point that the bad cops seem to be able to get away with bad behavior all the time .
 they are never treated like everyone else and police departments seem to bend over backwards to protect them .
 he said to the effect  &apos;well ,  it &apos;s a hard job and we all need to know the other guy has our back .
 if we turn on each other like that then it destroys the trust .
 my response was basically if that &apos;s the truth then there is no such thing as good cops .
 if good cops protect the bad ones instead of going after them harder than they do other people then they are worse than the crooked cops .
 if you &apos;re a cop then just do your fucking job .
 it doesn &apos;t matter if the guy is wearing a badge or not .
 if he &apos;s a piece of shit criminal than arrest that piece of shit and put his ass away .
 “who wants to be in what is likely the most hated job on the planet ?
 ” ,  unfortunately exactly the kind of people you don’t want doing that job .
 i worked in a place where the population was about 75% black .
  as a white cop ,  i very quickly learned a lot about being respectful and how to be tactful .
  humor goes a long way and it &apos;s very important not to give off any sign of being fearful .
 they can sense it .
 you get used to shouts of abuse as you drive by and guys on the corner will try to provoke you by openly drinking beer .
 yes ,  but you learned to pick your battles .
  if you do ever need to stop someone and question them ,  you know that if you take too long ,  you will suddenly find yourself surrounded by an angry crowd who have no idea what you are asking .
 people in these areas are almost always reluctant to even be seen conversing with a cop out of fear of being seen as a snitch .
  it is true that if you do need to make an arrest ,  there will almost always be some level of resistance ,  which makes things very difficult as once you have made the commitment to make the arrest ,  you have to go through with it .
 i am not in any way making excuses for the cops in this particular video ,  but it isn &apos;t easy .
  however ,  the cop with his knee on the poor guy appears to be of the alpha male type of cop .
  these guys are bullies by nature and very difficult to work with if you personally police to different standards .
 it &apos;s very difficult to intervene as a partner as you will likely be ostracized .
 you take this route and your career is over .
 your social life is over .
  your marriage will have problems as cop families are pretty close .
 even that won &apos;t do much because by the supervisor gets there the damage will have already been done :(
 the most demoralizing part is that the pleading that that he couldn’t breathe and to check his vitals immediately were ignored .
 everyone knew they couldn’t help him without potentially risking their own lives is heartbreaking .
 if you can’t reason with the police we are doomed .
 here is the only possible thing i could think of in this type of situation .
 point your phone at the officer ,  hit record and say “i’m live-streaming this on facebook .
 please don’t become famous for killing that man .
 even if you are bluffing ,  the officer is not going to want to take a chance of facing a murder trial .
 also ,  don’t be surprised if there aren’t new phone apps being developed right now that will be a simple one touch to live stream to news organizations so it will be harder to hide shady behavior .
 the sad thing is tho ,  that if floyd didn &apos;t die this wouldn &apos;t even be on the news .
 thanks for reminding me to get that on a newer phone .
 it &apos;s only available in 18 states ,  but it &apos;s a good start .
 it is not illegal to record the police ,  no matter whats happening .
 yes ,  they may take your phone ,  but it wont be because you record them ,  it will be to cover their ass .
 record the police ,  always .
 if they confiscate it ,  go to the ada .
 not a lawyer ,  go to the adas office .
 if that goes nowhere ,  then go to a lwayer ,  and tell them that the adas office did nothing ,  cause they mught be corrupt as well .
 one of the most chilling elements is they knew they were being recorded by bystanders .
 they felt untouchable .
 not a cop but work for the police .
 if local law enforcement isn’t doing their job correctly you ,  typically ,  should contact your state law enforcement .
 state troopers are the ones who you talk to if you’re having issues like that .
 and even if you succeed you &apos;re guaranteed to go to jail for the rest of your life for assaulting police officers .
 that &apos;s the irony here .
 if you intervene ,  you better hope the man dies so your actions can &apos;t be dismissed as unjustified .
 you would also end up saving the police officers career by preventing him from killing the guy .
 the biggest loser would be the person doing the right thing .
 exactly what i &apos;ve been thinking this entire time .
 if the citizens rushed the cop and the suspect lives ,  then you better be ready for a world of hurt ,  physically and via the courts .
 it didn &apos;t seem all that far from the group of bystanders rushing the cops .
 at close range the cops guns are just as likely to be used against them as the bystanders .
 i could totally see that .
 groundbreaking stuff to imagine what the media might describe as a “civilian uprising” if someone fought back
 wow this is sad .
 it reads like a guidebook on how to placate your abuser .
 try these techniques !
 and maybe today he won &apos;t beat you to death !
 it &apos;s straight fucking disgusting that this is the appropriate response to police murdering someone in broad daylight .
 so we have to coddle cops to protect their egos when they are murdering someone ?
 ugh what a world we live in .
 jesus christ america .
 as a canadian ,  this is so baffling to me .
 where i live ,  i saw a man fight off an officer and run .
 when the two officers caught the guy ,  they brought him down and started to detain him ,  and he started saying  &apos;ow ow ow !
  &apos; the officers very calmly asked him what hurt ,  he fought back and said it hurt and they just replied ,   &apos;ok sir ,  i understand ,  can you tell us what hurts so we can do this without hurting you ?
  &apos; the guy finally just said ,   &apos;i have a sore on my arm !
  &apos;  &apos;which arm sir ?
  &apos;  &apos;my right one !
  &apos; and they just grabbed him differently ,  being polite and assuring him they didn &apos;t want you hurt him .
 he calmed down and stopped fighting them ,  they got him cuffed and put in the cruiser ,  no one had to get mean ,  even though the guy started off trying to get away ,  they were so calm and patient ,  he just calmed down .
 i don &apos;t understand why you need to be so fucking aggro in the us .
 cops here are efficient ,  they respond very fast when called ,  they deescalate situations and most importantly ,  treat people with respect .
 and because of that ,  people like the police here ,  there &apos;s just not that much contention and hate towards them or back at the civilians .
 i mean ,  there &apos;s probably some bad apples and certainly there are bad areas where police are not great in canada ,  but in general ,  there &apos;s not nearly as many incidents here ,  even taking population into account .
 you just need to be a member of your community and care about people ,  even the ones who need to be detained .
 it &apos;s not that hard to care and have empathy ,  honestly .
 sure ,  in very dangerous situations ,  mistakes can be made of course ,  but stuff like what happens in america with police is just wholly unacceptable and 100% preventable .
 and it &apos;s only a matter of favoring respect and deescalation over punishment and anger ,  or rage in the case of the guy kneeling on someone .
 if that happened here ,  as a civilian ,  i could easily walk to to the officer and tell them to stop ,  easily !
 they wouldn &apos;t arrest me for doing so ,  and they &apos;d be in deep shit if they ever did something like that .
 it &apos;s just so crazy to me how much of a power trip police in america are on .
 thanks for your input .
 but this idea sounds like it’s built off of experiences with police in predominantly white neighborhoods .
 a lady in the george floyd video specifically says she is a first responder and requests they check his vitals .
 no response except to tell her to get back on the sidewalk .
 approaching with your hands in plain view means nothing .
 a video of ahmad arbery in an earlier incident shows his hands in plain view ,  unmoving and not in his pockets .
 and an officer still yells for him to remove his hands from his pockets while simultaneously pulling the trigger on a taser
 it is the point of the 2a .
 wonder how it goes down if a number of citizens draw on the officer screaming at him to get on the ground in a citizens arrest ,  all caught on video .
 force the supreme court to address justice reform .
 i mean ,  the murderer clearly saw he was being filmed .
 it didn &apos;t stop anything .
 why would a live stream be any different ?
 the police force needs civilian oversight ,  but that won’t happen because ‘oh but the police are going to be restricted in what they can do !
  &apos;just like if someone breaks into my house .
 i can shoot that person .
  &apos; unless you are black and they are police in plain civilian clothing ,  at the wrong address .
 then you will be charged with attempted murder of a police officer .
 this is the answer right here .
 i agree wholeheartedly .
 now ,  about what bystanders can do while this shit is happening ,  i &apos;m not sure .
 that is a very good point .
 we have to explain why we shot someone breaking into our house ,  they should have to explain why they shot a citizen ,  to a judge that is outside of the cops jurisdiction .
 not to mention that civil forfeiture is a legal theft from the citizens money right into the police &apos;s pocket .
 and try as you might ,  you will not get that money back because they can say it was  &apos;suspicious  &apos; .
  &apos;the police is supposed to protect and serve .
 the military is supposed to inflict as much harm as possible onto the enemy .
 so why is it that the police force is acting like the military with tanks ,  tear gas ,  and with military weapons and force against american citizens ?
  &apos;-quote from a waco radio caster as the building burned down with people still inside due to the police .
 and therein lies the problem .
 the second you start rushing a cop they can immediately claim they felt violently threatened and were under full protection of the law to use deadly force .
 it woulda turned into a blood bath had anyone tried to use force to stop these cops .
 which makes this whole thing even worse .
 these guys were willing to murder someone in cold blood right in full view of the public .
 you think they would have any issue taking anyone else down who dares try to stop their killing of this innocent man ?
 even if you had a gun .
 would you be willing to shoot a cop to save someone else ?
 it makes me feel shitty to say it ,  but i dont think i would unless it was a family member .
 thao is a fucking racist thug too .
 he beat the living shit out of a handcuffed black guy a few years ago .
 there &apos;s a lot of bad cops in minneapolis .
 the worst part is that the one who actually committed the murder didn’t do so in the heat of the moment .
 he was calm and collected .
  and it went on for a long time .
  that guy really is a psychopath .
 talk about groupthink jfc
 uk police aren &apos;t routinely armed - but there are always armed police .
 usually on fast cars so they can get to specific calls/reports quickly if there &apos;s a hint of a possibility that someone is armed .
 they also patrol high risk places - usually airports but also any places deemed  &apos;high-risk &apos; for possible terrorist attack .
 it’s in case norway tries to invade via commercial airliner .
 just like the old lantern story: “one if by land ,  two if by norwegian air 747 .
 we run scenarios where officers pretending to be the subjects will be taken down to the ground and cuffed so we all know the feeling .
  during initial training especially ,  we &apos;ll put slight weight on each other so we know ,  once you &apos;re in that position ,  breathing is incredibly restricted .
 it &apos;s a controlled environment so we have a safety word in place so we know if someone is in pain or can &apos;t breath .
 this and the resulting low standards for admission to the police academy .
 rookie in a big city in canada .
 in germany it’s 3 years .
 just like any other apprenticeship .
 i was never a cop but i graduated the academy in 2013 with 1000 hours of post training over the course of a year .
 the training i personally received on this topic is incredibly simple .
 if any force was used ,  they &apos;re under arrest ,  and they &apos;re in cuffs ,  you search them thoroughly and sit them up assuming there are no other threats .
 you immediately begin checking their well being before you even read miranda rights or interrogate .
 there was an incredible amount of emphasis on asphyxiation and its not tolerated for obvious reasons .
 it was emphasized greatly because they know the danger and its not even the safest hold for the officer .
 the officer in the video seemed to lack training ,  empathy ,  and most importantly common sense .
 its not an unknown topic to never put your knee/foot/forearm/hand on their neck .
 its talked about in training ,  at least for us it was .
 when i said lacked training i meant its poor technique .
 i didn &apos;t mean it was the primary reason or anything ,  just that it stood out to me because it goes against what i was taught on a fundamental level
 move him off the guy ,  and i have seen a coworker do something similar ,  he doesnt work for my department anymore because of that incident (luckily guy didnt die) if you have someone in handcuffs  the second you have control of the subject you &apos;re supposed to roll them on their side so that they have unrestricted breathing ,  that was drilled into my head from the first day i started training .
 the rodney king case had the same type of evidence and look where that went .
 i can &apos;t understand why ,  but these cops can get away with murder with a slap on the wrist unforunately
 same with eric garner
 one of the the others definitely could have stepped in and took over .
 i have no fucking idea why they just kept him there on the ground like that after being cuffed .
 here in florida ,  if you are committing a crime with multiple people and one of those idiot people kill someone .
 or someone dies during the crime ,  even one of the criminals ,  everybody gets charged with murdered .
 all of them should get some sort of responsibility place upon them for this murder
 not a police officer but ,  i agree .
 there &apos;s multiple comments from people trying to troll .
 never underestimate some human beings and what they &apos;ll do to be a cunt .
 there are edgy armchair teenagers that will joke about it .
 now to sort by controversial and see all the failed attempts at humor mixed in with people be wrong or offensive .
 i was taught this and that a community needs to be policed how it wants to be policed .
 you have to work with the assumption that the vast majority of your community are good people ,  every community is different ,  i was taught by the sheriff of lane county oregon ,  his example was when marijuana was illegal but the vast majority in his county didn &apos;t care about it he made it the lowest priority to deal with he was very happy when it was made legal .
  i wish people like him ran more departments
 mate whenever i visit the us the border guards seem to have a massive hard-on for telling people what to do .
 some of those guys are so erect for their automatic rifles too .
 only losers enjoy power like that .
 houston police chief art acevado is speaking and tweeting out against it .
  he used to be austin &apos;s chief .
  i really appreciate him doing that .
 it’s a great question ,  especially since their unions seem well set up to lobby against any sensible reforms .
 i can &apos;t speak as a police officer ,  but i can speak as a public employee .
 it &apos;s simple ,  i am not allowed to make statements on behalf of the government .
 now if you are asking why culture that allows things like this to happen are allowed to foster .
 i &apos;ll leave that to the leos to answer .
 for everyone &apos;s clarification - i merely stating the facts ,  not taking a side .
 2 of the other cops were helping to kill him ,  seriously .
 one guy had knee on the neck and you cant see the other two ,  who were crushing his chest .
 these guys talking like  &apos;if i were there i &apos;d fuck those cops up ,  idc !
 why do they think we even have the story and video ?
 obviously a good amount of people didn &apos;t stand for this shit .
 but what are they going to do ?
 fight off 4 cops that are already about to kill someone in front of them ?
 delusional hero wannabies
 how big a group of unarmed citizens would you need to overwhelm four cops like that ?
 i do not recommend assembling groups of unarmed citizens to overwhelm cops .
 my question is a thought experiment ,  not a call to action .
 and if you were successful in saving his life they &apos;d argue that you attacked a cop for no reason and they killed you because they feared for their lives .
 and people wonder why some people are terrified of cops .
 they would have had to tactically taken out four police officers at the same time .
 that is a really sad commentary on our police .
 that is exactly what happened ,  and clearly the end result is that the cop didn’t stop and someone died .
 even if you didnt go to the extreme and either pushed the officer off or used a weapon to get them to step off of the person ,  you would go to jail .
 the person would have been charged with  &apos;interfering &apos; or something related .
 even with the video ,  there would be a significant court battle to prove the officer was doing harm .
 i dont know that i would put my life in the hands of a jury if i were not a cop .
 and this is the problem ,  we rely on the police to do their job right ,  and rely on the police to police themselves in these specific situations .
 with this recorded evidence ,  i dont think we can rely on anyone ,  and the person in custody is clearly at the mercy of those with weapons .
 this is what peoples fear is based on .
  blm and other related groups (including myself ,  as a white person) ,  fear the police as they are out of control ,  have the blue line to protect themselves ,   the police union to keep their jobs ,  and a long history of the court of law protecting them .
 we are in an authoritarian governmental state ,  make no mistake .
 i have always completely disregarded the disturbing content warnings ,  but this video was different for me too .
 it made me feel queasy when i saw george go limp and stop speaking and that feeling stayed with me for the remainder of the day .
 the officer looked proud to have so much power and attention .
 i wish there was more i could do .
 you may be interested to know in the uk we have the ipcc (independent police complaints commission) who are notified whenever someone is shot by an armed officer as standard so it is always independently investigated ,  even in the blatantly obvious cases where the shooting needed to happen .
 works pretty well .
 unfortunately ,  does this mean that he won &apos;t be charged ?
 it &apos;s happened two times before ,  after all .
 absolute fucking scumbags .
 and the culture of  &apos;we protect our own &apos; .
 and us vs them mentality .
  i think that &apos;s the true rot here ,  coupled with systemic racism .
  but yeah ,  even so it would have been fixed with the slightest bit of accountability over the years .
 also selling them military equipment so they think they &apos;re soldiers not officers of the law .
 no accountability and half the population believes the police can do no wrong ,  that what ever happens happened because the person must have deserved it .
 well clearly they &apos;re right ,  mps are harder to retrain .
 i was an mp and tried to become a civilian cop when i got out ,  but you gotta drink the kool aid to be a cop in the 21st century .
 i got value out of my time as an mp ,  but i never got on board with the law enforcement sub culture that has taken over the job .
 my brother and my best friend are police ,  and their whole identity is being a cop .
 from how they dress and what they watch and how they lean politically .
 that is exactly what they want to retrain out .
 the military actually takes actions against its own ,  especially if it seems like someone higher on the food chain will take shit for it .
 i &apos;m not saying this happens every time ,  but no one wants to go to leavenworth .
 there is a great series episode (2 ?
 ) of radio lab called  &apos;shots fired .
  &apos;  in the second episode they look at the daytona beach police force ,  which not only eliminated police shootings but pretty much any use of force at the time .
 they specifically recruited former military personnel ,  because they don &apos;t freak out when civilians are hard to handle or even threatening .
 i don &apos;t know if they kept the same command or philosophy but this shouldn &apos;t happen and we apparently know how to stop it .
 can’t retrain well-travelled people who went through real life-and-death combat to be small-minded racists with delusions of heroism i guess 
 you have more experience which would make you more valuable ,  they don’t want to pay mps what they are worth .
 it’s stupid man .
 i &apos;d personally argue that not stopping an injustice when you are capable of doing so and know it &apos;s happening is tacit participation .
 if your buddy on the force is posting racist shit and generally hotheaded and violent and you don &apos;t do shit about that then when he inevitably goes too far that should weigh on you conscience .
 and if you protect him after that ,  then you &apos;re just straight up supporting that shit .
 oh so hes a serial killer lmao .
 i am dissapointed this gets to b my most upvoted comment on this site
 what in the actual fuck man .
 i &apos;m perfectly fine with proper law enforcement ,  but this is absolute negligence .
  &apos;a troubling past &apos; would be putting that lightly .
 i was a marine musician .
 (yeah the marine corps has band nerds) .
 at one point i got punished for failure to follow orders - i wasn &apos;t practicing the required amount .
 confined to quarters and work for two weeks ,  forfeited two weeks pay .
 i was held to higher standards and punished more harshly for fucking up a sousa march than many cops face for killing someone .
 “we gotta look out for each other” is for surviving combat ,  not avoiding accountability .
 it shouldn’t matter who’s breaking the law .
 saw a thing the other day that said  &apos;if there are 1000 good cops and 10 bad cops but the good cops keep quiet about the bad cops ,  there are really 1010 bad cops .
  &apos; a lot of truth to that
 interesting last paragraph .
 thanks for your perspective
 the idea of internal peer pressure to be more like these  &apos;bully &apos; types is so gross and self perpetuating .
 thank you for the detailed response .
 the perspective here on the difficulty of intervention needs to be higher up .
 how many people won &apos;t pick a fight at thanksgiving dinner about kaepernick ,  let alone intervene in a case where you know you &apos;ll be the only person to pay the price .
 (the cops sitting around didn &apos;t know the victim would die - and if they intervened and he didn &apos;t die ,  sounds like they &apos;d be just as ostracized and that would be the end of their career in local law enforcement) .
 the culture is the problem .
 very interesting perspective .
 thank you for that .
 let’s not forget the cop standing next to the cop strangling the innocent man .
 he was equally guilty .
 is there anything that a citizen could have said to dissuade an officer from what happened here ?
 the supervisor can call them and do something .
 i got pulled over in high school for turning without signaling .
 the cop asked us where we were going and then if he could search the car .
 the driver told them no .
 so they ordered us all out of the car into the cold and told us we couldn &apos;t wear our jackets because there might be weapons in them .
 we were going to wait for the k9 unit to come sniff the car for drugs .
 the driver called his mom when we first got pulled over because honestly ,  as black people ,  we are afraid of cops and feel they are a danger to us (this was in 2003 long before blm) .
 she called to check up on us 30 minutes later and we were still pulled over .
 she got busy and called back 2 hours later to ask what had happened .
 we told her we were still outside waiting for the k9 unit .
 she called the station and asked for their supervisor .
 the supervisor called the officers and they immediately let us go .
 the guy is already as good as dead .
 the key is quality documentation and closing in the walls on this cop .
 if there is time to call 911 and document what &apos;s happening ,  he can &apos;t claim it was a rushed moment
 please tell me this person is on trial for mueder ?
 i just watched the video and i feel physically ill thinking about a person like that .
 being fired isn &apos;t justice ,  this person needs to go to prison .
 and even that &apos;s not justice ,  nothing will bring this man back to life .
 it &apos;s just heartbreaking and so unfair .
 i can &apos;t believe this is still happening in a country that is supposedly so developed as usa
 police training leads to them being impossible to reason with in these scenarios .
 training reaches them that they must maintain control of the situation at all costs ,  and taking feedback about anything or changing course at the suggestion of anyone other than a superior would be letting go of control ,  even if only the tiniest fragment ,  and in their mind letting any control go is a sign of weakness to be exploited .
 i like the idea ,  but let &apos;s not forget philando castile &apos;s murder got live streamed in the very same city as george floyd was murdered by police .
 alternatively ,  get it on an older phone ,  because you &apos;re not getting that phone back when they take it for containing evidence of a crime being committed .
 im curious why its only available in certain states ?
  seems like the freedom to record a police transaction should automatically apply to all 50 states .
  why should there be state exceptions or differences ?
 why the patchwork approach ?
 they are ,  in fact ,  untouchable .
 that &apos;s why they  &apos;feel &apos; that way .
 even if you just pull the cop off .
 the victim has now survived ,  but there is no proof they would died ,  and you &apos;ve assaulted a cop ,  interfered with an arrest ,  and probably 10 other  &apos;crimes &apos; they &apos;d tack on to make you plead out
 so the dying guy is shit out of luck ?
 we just let him die ?
 at what point should you contact the (i &apos;m just guessing here) fbi or something ?
 like what &apos;s the chain of authority look like after the state troopers ?
 to paraphrase the 2a people ,   &apos;the cops are only minutes away .
  &apos;  what should be done in the meantime ,  while a cop is suffocating a restrained suspected forgerer ?
 you couldn &apos;t even pull a police dog off a guy ,  that &apos;s assault .
 meanwhile cops shooting family dogs is characteristic of an epidemic ,  it &apos;s so common .
 something &apos;s gotta give .
 jesus this is the darkest thing i &apos;ve read in a while
 pretty sure they will implicate you in the man &apos;s death though .
 the second amendment is there for this exact reason .
 to give the citizens the means to defend themselves against an overstepping government ,  in this case ,  police literally murdering citizens in broad daylight .
 lots of people in this country carry ,  and lots of those people like to talk about their rights to do so .
 none i don &apos;t think are willing to die/go to jail to use that right to intimidate a cop into civil behavior .
 i wonder if an officer would get away with  &apos;fearing for his life &apos; and killing an armed person nearing an arrest scene .
 can you imagine the stories coming out of the press (reading the cop &apos;s story verbatim as truth) if they had rushed them and killed the murderer ?
 4 dead cops ,  8 dead civilians ,  and a manhunt that would kill dozens .
 they train like they &apos;re at war already with my grandma or the guy that cuts my hair .
 that &apos;s too friendly .
 it would be a  &apos;riot &apos; full of looters .
 they &apos;d play up the guys stealing televisions to make it seem ok that kids are getting murdered in the streets by grown men with military gear .
 it sounds to me like bear grills trying to describe how to act around a wild murder machine to me .
 something acting without thought ,  just aggression .
  &apos;be sure not to startle the officers .
 make yourself appear small and unthreatening so as not to trigger violent impulses .
 that said ,  what if you proffer the  &apos;i &apos;m a martial arts instructor &apos; bid and the arrestee dies anyway while you &apos;re tending to him ?
 i mean ,  yes - you did the noble thing but the outcome may be criminal culpability and ,  certainly ,  civil liability .
 i think you hit a lot of things on the head .
 a lot of our cops are very  &apos;aggro &apos; really fast .
 i &apos;ve been pulled over and had guns drawn on me ,  for a traffic violation .
 even been calm ,  cool ,  and collected i &apos;ve had officers yell and tilt really fast for no reason .
 they train for force on force scenarios and play them over and over again in their heads .
 they rarely work on de-escalation .
 i actually train with a lot of cops now in bjj and they are beyond frustrated with how this dude acted and how his fellow officers did everything wrong (as they put it - which i agree) .
 how none of the officers stood up and said  &apos;hey man ,  he &apos;s cuffed lets put him in the car/lets set him up on the curb/a million of other tactics they are trained for that wouldn &apos;t have lead to this mans death .
 it truly is appalling and now you can understand why there is a huge mistrust for the police as a whole because the good cops aren &apos;t weeding out the bad ones ,  the unions protect their own ,  and they feel its very much a  &apos;us vs them &apos; mentality within certain precincts
 the answer is that the other three cops would’ve put a hail of bullets into whoever pulled the gun and anyone in their general vicinity .
 my favorite one is “but the officer wants to go home at the end of the day” like the other person shouldn’t have that option ?
 ‘oh but the police are going to be restricted in what they can do !
 yeah ,  that &apos;s the idea ?
 this is exactly what i was thinking about too .
 then you will be charged with attempted murder of a police officer .
 provided you don &apos;t die in a jail cell .
 plainclothes roads should not be a thing .
 from what i’ve heard ,  even the military in foreign countries often has to announce themselves and tell the people to surrender before they can enter or use force .
 there needs to be something like this for police raids
 right and in that scenario ,  he doesn &apos;t die (even though he was about to) ,  and this goes from murder of the victim to assaulting a police officer at best for the good samaritan ,  and immediate death from gunshots at worst .
 and like ,  what &apos;s that accomplish besides getting you shot to death immediately afterwards
 better be ready to die for your cause if you do that .
 sad fucked up world we living in
 of course you wouldn &apos;t because cops have all the protection from the law .
 you can &apos;t touch cops ,  they can do anything they want and get away with it .
 and god forbid you kill a cop in self defense you &apos;ll still get life in prison .
 oh yeah trust me i know ,  i &apos;m just saying in terms of perception
 you don &apos;t hit someone that &apos;s cuffed .
 thank you for thr answer .
 it confounds me some cops over in us have zero control on their triggers and rage/ego unless their training was inedequate
 a very underrated point .
 the officer that shot tamir rice was rejected by his training officer at the police academy .
  in why he failed him he wrote something like  &apos;there is no amount of training that can correct what is wrong with him ,  he is unfit .
  &apos;  another department hired him a month later .
 the police academy .
 the world needs more mahoney and less tackleberry ?
 probably like the military ,  you need people to the job but the pay isn’t all that great and the hours suck .
 keeping the force manned generally beats everyone being “good” .
 a saying in the military ,  the highest standards occur when we need less people .
 that &apos;s actually very good to hear .
  i &apos;ve already heard people make the argument that  &apos;well he &apos;s not a medical expert and couldn &apos;t have been expected to know that he was suffocating the man .
 i &apos;m a paramedic and saw an emt try to choke out one of my patients unprovoked .
 some people are insane .
 would they all get the same charge ?
 i’m assuming the idiot with his knee on the mans neck would get a more severe charge right ?
 so the other men are accomplices (not accessories) which means they could face the same charge .
 we will see though .
 from my observation ,  police chiefs are often mutually exclusive to police officers especially for controversy like this .
 there is precedent for police chiefs coming out and condemning bad cops .
 what we don &apos;t see is police officers coming out to condemn bad cops and this is the group thats more of the problem police in the us .
 they don &apos;t call out ,  report ,  or condemn bad cops ,  and often they punish those who do .
 ironically ,  police chiefs can do little to change police culture ,  it has to be the police and the police union if we want any effective change .
 i appreciate that .
  next though he needs to finally address the no knock plainclothes raid that ended up with two people dead and exposed hpd faking evidence and showing how crooked cops could be .
  i was too hasty in writing this and got the details wrong .
  it was the police union chief ,  gamaldi who said the line about making a list .
  sorry for the misinformation .
  and please don &apos;t buy awards .
 i &apos;m also a public employee .
 speaking out against your employer is grounds for termination .
 yeah ,  your union can get your job back ,  but management will find a way to get you to quit .
 and another one holding the crowd back .
 there &apos;s new footage now .
  3 cops full weight on him .
 and if you were successful in saving his life they &apos;d argue that you attacked a cop for no reason and they killed you because they feared for their lives .
 it may have been legal to intervene to save that guy &apos;s life knowing what we know now ,  but had you actually intervened you would have prevented evidence that he was going to die from forming ,  therefore you &apos;re just guilty of obstruction .
 if this ain &apos;t the truth
 the wisest course because unfortunately a more interfering action may get you seriously hurt or killed .
 you’ll never be able to legally interfere with a law enforcement officer even if they are murdering people because the sate cannot risk the loss of power projection .
 the state manages to control hundreds of millions of people with around 800 , 000 police officers because of the projection of power .
 the police exist to protect the powerful ,  they’re not generically serving some abstract notion of “the people” that’s just a lie they tell you in grade school .
 they use the threat of imprisonment and violence to oppress the population and back it up with tue farcical “justice” system .
 unfortunately bad press is a motivating factor in getting the da to do their job instead of just the straight facts .
 my question would be ,  is there a separate body that looks at these police shootings that is outside of the police dept and the da &apos;s office that works closely with the police or do we have to keep doing this and having these murders and the only time the killers get in trouble is if theres enough publicity to get the justice the victims deserve ?
 do you remember seeing them in the news and on a world wide platform ?
 it &apos;s the exposure that will get him in trouble this time .
 i wish i could give you gold .
 i &apos;m curious because i don &apos;t know anything about it: what &apos;s that subculture ,  and how does it work to keep out people that don &apos;t embrace it ?
 neutrality helps the oppressor .
 lol this case is fucked without the context .
 with it he just looks like a serial killer using a badge as an alibi .
 this would be comical if it wasn’t so fucking infuriating .
 i dont get why all serial killers dont just become cops 
 yes ,  he is a serial killer .
 and derek chauvin &apos;s wife is quoted to have said ,   &apos;under all that uniform ,  he &apos;s just a softie ,  &apos;  -kellie chauvin .
 what the actual fuck ?
 that &apos;s actually what i took away from the op &apos;s friend &apos;s argument .
 cops think they are at war and will resort to warzone measures to protect their fellow officers .
 as someone who has band experience ,  sousa marches are no fucking joke .
 it should ,  but the standard should be higher for police officers .
 as enforcers of the law ,  they can expected to be aware of it to a better degree ,  and as guardians of the public trust the crimes they commit disintegrate that trust .
 a police officer who commits a crime should be subject to ,  at a minimum ,  loss of pension and benefits for any crime above a misdemeanor ,  and the maximum allowable penalty for the crime committed .
 they should also be eligible to be subjected to double the maximum penalty for both jail time and fines ,  and the same fine should be levied against the department if there is found to be any cover up ,  inaction on the part of the department ,  or other mishandling of the case .
 cops should be punished more for their transgressions because their transgressions do more harm to their departments and the communities they serve .
 unfortunately ,  it seems it always has .
 or another way to put it is if you have a drop of wine in a barrel of sewage you have a barrel of sewage ,  but if you have a drop of sewage in a barrel of wine you still have a barrel of sewage .
 that last paragraph is everything .
 i just heard in better call saul that ratting out a cop coworker is suicide for the rat and the other cop .
 so no one does it .
 why take two down when two can stay up .
 i believe the four were fired because two other cops were kneeling on him but you couldn &apos;t see it because it was blocked by the car .
  at this point ,  it &apos;s all about maintaining total control ,  and someone shouting advice ,  no matter how well-intentioned ,  will simply be told to move on .
 i &apos;m simply pointing out what happens .
  not what should be done .
 not sure how recent this was but there was recently a supreme court case that came down and said that making you wait for the k9s an unreasonably long time (even 30min is absurd) violates your rights under either the unlawful detention ,  search and seizure ,  or some other interpretation if they had no other probably cause to hold you .
 so the supervisor did the right thing to save their skin .
 that &apos;s so stupid couldn &apos;t they check the jackets ?
 fucking power drunk asshole .
 that is absolutely insulting and ridiculous to hold two people for over 2 hours on the side of the road in cold weather for a k-9 unit that was completely unwarranted .
  good on your friend’s mom for patiently waiting to act .
  i wish i could have heard that conversation between her and the supervisor .
  glad you are still with us to share that story .
 what &apos;s funny is your friend had every right to decline .
 unless they have reason without a doubt they can &apos;t force anyone to be searched .
 sounds like the cops knew they were wrong ,  especially for something so minimal as a turn signal .
 legally you can decline ,  do i think it will make some cops think you &apos;re hiding something ,  maybe ,  but they can &apos;t prove it
 it happened only two days ago .
 the officers involved have been fired and the fbi is investigating the case .
 no it just happened so no justice yet .
 philando castile was in falcoln heights and shot by saint anthony pd (2016) ,  so not the same city but a near by city .
 you &apos;re thinking of jamar clark who was shot in north minneapolis (2015) .
 so three high profile deaths of black men by the police in the metro area in recent memory .
 also ,  police officers often attack people filming them
  you &apos;re going down for years .
  fucking years son
 it’s kinda backwards but if the troopers are doing something like this then you’d call local law enforcement so that at least there’s another law enforcement entity present .
 as far as the fbi .
 honestly despite what tv shows might make you think ,  there’s almost no way you’re going to get in direct contact with the fbi unless they want to contact you .
 the most you can do is go to their page and submit a tip .
 the ahmed aubrey case is a good example of this .
 local cops were corrupt ,  state cops (gbi) stepped in .
 before they announced charges ,  the fbi announced that they were looking into federal hate crime charges if the gbi didn &apos;t prosecute .
 i think the 2a people have ideas on that too !
 in reality they would probably charge you with the guys murder and blame his death on you interfering .
 reality is pretty dark in america .
 didnt that happen already ?
 the police stopped a car at a traffic stop and the man declared he has a carry permit and was currently carrying .
 so the cops did exactly what a logical person would do ,  they pumped the car full of bullets ,  with the mans wife and baby daughter still in the car .
 honestly any officer of the law found to be breaking any law at all should be immediately fired at minimum ,  then prosecuted as a civilian ,  then depending on the severity of the crime ,  triple the sentence that a regular civilian would get .
 if you threaten cops with  &apos;punching that dude in the face because he shifted his leg will end up up in prison for 30 years ,  or on deathrow &apos; would likely make a lot of the corrupt ones leave .
 then you will be charged with attempted murder of a police officer .
 provided you don &apos;t die in a jail cell .
 provided you don &apos;t die in the back of the van on the way to jail .
 then having your character torn apart by the 24 hour news cycle while your family is harassed for the rest of their lives .
 and if you somehow live ,  that &apos;s one hell of a case to deal with
 seems like he got unofficially charged with a death sentence .
 its something foreigners don &apos;t really understand about the us .
  different cities ,  states ,  and counties all have their own individual rules and there &apos;s no centralized controling element to the police .
 you can &apos;t  reform the way police behave because there &apos;s no one organization to petition to reform .
  it takes literally every jurisdiction in the country to be haggled by its citizens before meaningful change can take place in any signficant enough geographic area to matter .
 do you have the source on this ?
 i &apos;d like to reference it in future conversations
 the world needs more hightower .
 that’s such a wild and irresponsible line of thinking .
 ”well i didn’t know it was gonna kill him so it’s not my fault it killed him” .
 anyone making that argument is a nutjob .
 you don &apos;t need to be a medical expert to know that putting your entire body weight on someone &apos;s neck is gonna suffocate them .
 people that make that argument are beyond stupid
 i called 911 once because my husband had a seizure and came out of it aggressive and confused (i’d never witnessed him have one before) .
 i watched a cop choke him out and threaten to kill him if he didn’t stop thrashing .
 he had a handprint on his throat for 3 days .
 they refused to believe me when i told them it was a seizure and said if i didn’t tell them what drugs he took he was going to die .
 there were two emts and three cops .
 nobody did a damn thing except ignore me and my friend screaming to stop hurting him .
 any back story here
 how much you wanna bet the police body cam footage mysteriously comes up missing too ?
 if you drive the getaway car and the guy inside shoots the clerk you catch a murder charge .
 this is worse than that .
 so your brothers would rather let you go alone into a dangerous situation than have you bad mouth a killer cop ?
 that right there seems to be the core problem .
 this is the real answer right here folks  .
 bad cops and bro cop culture have ruined out police system  .
 it is a sham and only serves to protect itself .
 we are headed toward an ever more dystopic police state  .
 we are trained not to talk to the press and let the pio (public information officer) take media .
 and for clarity ,  police chiefs are employed by cities ,  led by a mayor .
 where as sheriff deputies answer to the county sheriff who answers to the state .
 the video of the incident is horrifying for those who haven &apos;t seen it .
 the guy is a fucking psycho ,  asking stupid things of a completely panicked man .
 this is one of the worst examples of policing i have ever seen .
 he’s a shit cop ,  scared ,  stupid and giving unclear directions .
 that he got acquitted is insane ,  that the cops allowed this shit cop to get a lifetime pension is despicable .
 at what employer are you allowed to write “youre fucked” on government property and not get fired .
 i fire people for far less in the private sector .
 if you ever watch live pd or cops you can see the good cops ,  they are never nasty ,  don’t let their emotions get the best of them and are always in control .
 then you can see the nervous ones ,  the dumb ones ,  the scared ones and the militant nazi ones .
 if departments just extracted those shitbags everyone would be better off but cops don’t want accountability in any form .
 then you &apos;ve got the kids in midland tx laying on the ground in his grandmother &apos;s front yard ,  begging the five police to not shoot him .
 and they were getting angry because  &apos;all they wanted him to do is stand up and walk toward them .
 he was right to just lay there and let them figure out what the fuck they were doing .
 one  &apos;wrong &apos; move and you &apos;re dead ,  even on camera ,  even in surrender .
 tye anders is his name and it &apos;s all on camera .
 because the cop said he rolled a stop sign .
 or michael ramos ,  sitting in his car when cops roll up .
 he stands outside his car with his hands up and a cop shots him with a bean bag shotgun .
 he decides they &apos;re trying to kill him ,  so he gets back in his car and drives away from them .
 and a sniper kills him as he drives .
 if i were black i &apos;d be terrified every time my kids left the house .
 not only was he acquitted ,  he was temporarily rehired by the same police department so he could apply for an accidental disability pension .
 this is straight up general operating procedure in every police murder .
  &apos;firing &apos; to appease the public .
 immediate appeal to grant pay and benefits to officer under investigation .
 minor penalty such as a suspension (read: paid vacation) .
 unless it &apos;s real bad .
 and they just get a partial pension .
 public employee here as well .
 i had a coworker ,  17 years on the job ,  get drunk one night after he thought he was treated unfairly by our supervisor (was assigned a job he thought was beneath him) .
 proceeded to rant on facebook for a bit .
 just one post ,  one time .
 about three weeks later he got called down to hr and terminated .
 they had told him that if the post was “private” they wouldn’t have cared ,  but since he made it “public” and then proceeded to share it with several local fb groups .
 and yes ,  the city has had all of their employees sign some sort of contract related to social media use ,  so it is all spelled out in black and white .
 also - here in wi ,  public workers (other than police and fire) no longer have union representation ,  thanks to scott walker’s act x .
 so we don’t even have that protection anymore .
 “don’t do drugs kids”   .
 he was pissing me off so bad with that .
 this cop is emblematic of the systemic problem .
 he saw colleagues doing something fucked up and didn’t speak up .
 i’m willing to bet these cops have done and said a ton of racist things ,  just not on camera .
 why did no one try to stop it then before it got this far ?
 that’s what happens across departments and why people are distrustful of the police or even that “most are good .
 ” way more cops are seeing other cops be racist assholes than actually are racist assholes .
 but their inaction makes them assholes too .
 me too ,  honestly .
 how many times do people have to die at the hands of police in full view of bystanders for us to act ?
 yeah ,  those situations don &apos;t often have win-win endings unfortunately
 if this wasn &apos;t publicised to the point that it has been ,  it would &apos;ve been rug sweeped and forgotten about .
 imagine how many more cases there are out there that that happened to ?
 that &apos;s why the fbi was brought in to conduct the investigation ,  they &apos;re above and beyond that da and police department
 til the usa doesn &apos;t have a watchdog organization .
 whenever theres an officer shooting here in ab canada asirt investigates to see if it was necessary .
 they also investigate any claims against the police and any injuries fatal or not .
 if i was you guys i &apos;d be pushing hard for a watchdog organization .
 i really hope you &apos;re right .
 gotcha covered brotato chip
 “thin blue line” is the core of the subculture .
 it’s basically that all cops will stand together because no one else will stand with them ,  and if you don’t agree then you’re not a real cop and not part of the “thin blue line” .
 like the above said ,  it guides all facets of identity ,  politics ,  and general socialization .
 you socialize with cops and cop families and because they’re “part of the thin blue line” ,  and it just becomes an echo chamber .
 when you don’t echo what’s in the echo chamber you get cast aside ,  no promotions ,  your reviews are never favorable ,  the whole experience is just walking uphill barefoot in the snow without a paddle .
 my dad did it for 25 years because he was really passionate about making a difference in the community and he found his niche and became so good at it he couldn’t be fired ,  but he had stacks of bad reviews and plenty of promotions he got passed over for (he was a beat cop till he retired) .
 he considered himself part of the tbl but he wasn’t really ,  especially not the same way that these new cops are in the 21st century .
 that &apos;s why there &apos;s a saying that the quickest and easiest way to legally kill someone is by joining the police force .
 and based on how low their requirements of mental fitness is ,  your regular psycho can easily join and start his murdering spree most especially if he &apos;s racist .
 so pretty much like an arsoninst who &apos;s a firefighter .
 dont be giving them ideas now ,  they &apos;ll fit in too well and we &apos;ll never catch them
 well ,  you have to be a racist serial killer .
 might go against the morals of the serial killer .
 i took the elective criminal justice academy at my high school back when i wanted to be a cop when i grew up and my teacher (who i still have utmost respect for) would often reiterate ,  especially when telling stories ,  that a lot of the time it felt like their bottom line was that “they make it back home to their families” .
 and i can have sympathy for that since it absolutely is a dangerous job at times but eventually that was what i realized ,  they think they’re at war every day .
 hell if you look at any tv cop show that idea that “any day could be your last” as a cop is pervasive through all of it .
 if they’re convinced they’re fighting a war then it kinda makes sense how a lot of them act ,  especially when you factor in the likelihood of “power tripping” and that the kind of person who would want to commit violence with impunity would want to become a cop .
 that’s why i think the whole system needs a revamp .
 they’re supposed to enforce laws ,  not wage war against “criminals”
 especially in op &apos;s case ,  as sousa directed the marine corps band .
  at that point ,  you might as well have taken a piss on chesty puller himself .
 it really is ,  and it unfortunately it puts the attitude behind acab in a certain context .
  if you get kicked out of the barrel for challenging the rotten apple ,  is it just a rotten apple or is the whole barrel spoiled ?
 there is a rough picture of the opposite side out there .
  clearly 3 cops on him though .
 that wasn &apos;t the problem ,  that was the excuse to punish them for saying no to a fishing expedition .
 if the cops had cause to search ,  they would have searched the jacket and the car .
 k-9 even being dispatched would have been questionable too .
 the cops figure if they make the suspect sweat it out ,  eventually they &apos;ll give in and give consent for search .
  it &apos;s the trifecta of win-win for a croupt ,  lazy cop .
 1) punish those who defy them ,  incentivizing them to      .
 2) maby get lucky and find something criminal in the car ,  maybe not .
 but with a driver &apos;s consent to search ,  whatever is found is a lot less likely to get tossed out in court .
 3) staying in service with dispatch at the same call considerably lowers the amount of work over all that you have to do ,  because one is not sent to call after call after call for service .
 the officers involved have been fired .
 this is more than what has happened in previous cases
 if the other cops watching don’t shoot you for interfering and “threatening” them .
 years away is your best outcome .
 that &apos;s obscenely fucked up specially since i think you are 100% correct
 and if someone else gets hit by the police officers &apos; bullets ,  you would be held liable for the cops putting that bullet in someone else .
 this is so sad but ,  honestly ,  that was my thought while watching the video .
  &apos;if i was there ,  how could i change this ?
  &apos; and my conclusion was ,   &apos;i &apos;d have to go after the cop pinning him down ,  risking my own life ,  there &apos;s no other way .
 i 100% understand why we have police but ,  i also feel like there &apos;s too many situations that call for civilian sacrifice in order to save others .
 it &apos;s gotten out of hand .
 also ,  don &apos;t forget that there &apos;s you sheriff &apos;s department too .
 they may or may not be able to help you depending on your state ,  but for some it might .
 i used to be a sheriff &apos;s deputy and sadly my department probably wouldn &apos;t be able to help because of our state laws (pa) but that &apos;s not the same for every state .
 yep ,  police dogs share equal protection as police officers .
  if only my dog shared the same rights .
 for example ,  how many pizza guys ,  ups guys ,  mailmen ,  etc .
  it &apos;s just insane that this is standard procedure !
  and to my knowledge no dog has ever ,  ever killed a police officer .
  so maybe tuck your dick behind your buttcheeks ,  tape it up ,  and refrain from killing innocent animals for five fucking minutes .
 yes i &apos;m drunk and angry and i will not be appeased with platitudes
 yes ,  this incident also took place in the twin cities area just a few years ago .
 his name was philando castile and he was killed by officer jeronimo yanez near the fairgrounds in saint paul .
 castile &apos;s girlfriend diamond reynolds recorded his bleeding dying body on facebook live for all to see .
 of course ,  the cop was judged not guilty .
 you would absolutely have to leave town .
  if an area has a police force corrupt enough to cover for a cold blooded murder ,  they &apos;re corrupt enough to kill you as revenge .
 dude was incredible .
 one of the most powerful ,  undeniable ,  and fascinating human beings to have ever lived .
 never considered cops could &apos;ve been the ones to kill him .
 would help explain why his killers were never caught .
 super easy to not get caught when the ones dealing with the evidence are the same ones who left it .
 also super easy to pin it on another rapper/gang/whoever .
 “you didn’t see what he did before” .
 people always say this .
 if someone raped & killed 50 kids ,  it &apos;s still just the police &apos;s job to arrest the offender .
 unfortunately ,  it is a vicious cycle of supply and demand .
 fewer people want to be police ,  the standards have to be lowered to fill the required spots ,  incidents involving the police increase due to the lowered standards ,  the police are seen in poor optics ,  fewer people want to be police as a result .
 it &apos;s worse than you think .
  i &apos;ll skip over the constitution which gets in the way of something like that .
 you can have several overlapping jurisdictions with different rules .
  each city is in a county .
  the city and county will both have their own force covering the same area .
 in this particular case ,  most jurisdictions in minnesota have made kneeling on a person &apos;s neck a violation of conduct .
  this particular jurisdiction did not .
 that argument doesn &apos;t work for regular citizens and police should be held to a higher standard .
 this guy either knew what he was doing or he &apos;s intellectually unfit to be in a position of authority .
 in either case he should lose his job immediately and stand trial the same as any other citizen would have to after doing what he did .
 i &apos;ve been punched ,  kicked ,  and bitten more times than i can count by patients that just had a seizure .
 i know me ,  my partners and everyone i work with would have never done anything even similar to what you went through ,  i &apos;m sorry that happened to you and it should never happen to anyone .
 even when it &apos;s just me and my partner one holds him down when the other sedates the patient or when i didn &apos;t carry sedation hold them down and ask for backup and sedation .
 no reason to hurt anyone damn it that &apos;s not why i went into this field .
 this all really depends on which area you are in ,  we have lots more people and experience where i worked (brooklyn ,  rest of nyc) than other states .
 also ,  it can be difficult for an emt to take a scene away from a crazed up cop ,  especially for rookies .
 some cops will go and intimidate you after the call for antagonizing them although you are the higher medical authority and are in charge of all things patient care related (never happened to me in the city but did happen out far into long island) can &apos;t stand cops like that ,  hope you guys are doing well
 this was late at night ,  we found the guy doing drugs in a backyard that wasn &apos;t his and took him to the hospital since he was completely intoxicated ,  we refused pd to come with us since he was cooperative and so wasted he was no danger to us even if he turned aggressive .
 we were walking this man (helping him ,  mind you since he was still high) into the hospital when he decided he was gonna be rude now and not walk anymore .
 from what i heard ,  he was driving when he heard the patient on the back of the truck talk shit (no big deal we all have thick skin) pulled over went on the back and tried punching the handcuffed patient to which the cop that was there flipped out .
 also ,  mind you this guy was really short and maybe weights 100 pounds .
 so that &apos;s the reason he needed the patient to be sitting to be able to choke them ,  he &apos;d never be able to choke a regular-sized standing person
 did the officers who murdered the sleeping woman get charged for murder tho ?
 they shot her like 8 times while she slept after working a double as an emt ,  as a first responder during the coronavirus pandemic .
 in other words ,  dropping charges against the boyfriend is not enough .
  this woman was murdered ,  and she deserves justice .
 these men are actually supposed to be the law .
 they should have much more of a responsibility to stop bad behavior than a common criminal .
 nobody wants to be the next serpico
 i’m a defense attorney and largely agree with you .
  every agency is different of course ,  but the departments i deal with regularly take officer integrity extremely seriously .
  discipline issues are almost never dealt with publicly though .
 the guy is a real piece of shit .
 what a fucking weasel
 wow ,  complaining about cops having targets on their backs when they can basically murder with impunity .
  fuck that guy .
 the tuttle and nicholas families hired a forensic team headed by mick maloney formerly of naval criminal investigative service (ncis) .
 the team processed the crime scene 10 may 2019 ,  three months after the raid .
 they were surprised to find evidence left behind or abandoned by the earlier houston forensic science center police investigation .
 they mapped out the trajectories from the bullet holes in the walls with the goal to reconstruct the shooting by matching bloodstains and bullet trajectories in the house to the wounds of the victims .
 the team spent four days reviewing the evidence .
 attorney chuck bourgue told the houston chronicle they found no evidence anyone in the house fired toward the door nor that tuttle &apos;s two rifles and two shotguns had even been fired .
 the team did find evidence that suggests police outside the house fired blindly through the walls .
 that’s not all they lied about .
 wow ,  that guy and bob kroll (the head of the minneapolis police union) can go fall down a flight of stairs balls first .
 you can’t hide from reddit lol
 sorry it &apos;s a bit jumbled ,  but if you want a taste ,  look up the officer at the center of it ,   gerald goines .
 not even just stupid ,  guy was asked to do two contradictory things that were impossible to do .
  then when failing to do those things he was executed .
 that video was terrifying .
 i can’t imagine how petrified that poor guy was when he was begging to that psychopath .
 i ,  like most people i &apos;m sure ,  have become somewhat desensitized to the things i see on reddit ,  but that video ?
 i will never forget that video .
 why haven &apos;t people taken justice against him ?
 the killer officer and the officer giving the terrible orders to the victim were two different people .
 at least two individuals in that department were hacks who shouldn &apos;t have had a badge to begin with .
 i still remember seeing that video .
 that was the day i realized that encounters with cops are like a game of simon says where the penalty for getting one wrong is death .
 i want to back this up and say he ain’t kidding ,  i honestly feel a little bit of me died watching it and i’m pretty weathered by this sort of stuff as it is  .
 kid was murdered
 exactly ,  i saw some comments ripping up the bystanders saying their cowards and just as guilty for just watching .
 i swear some people don &apos;t understand that sometimes every option is a loss .
 take a minute and re-read the above and realize this basically means  &apos;in the us the cops can kill you in broad daylight with citizens screaming at them that they &apos;re murdering you and if anyone tries to help they &apos;ll probably get killed too &apos; .
 its a sad and scary thought !
 i’m using this from now on .
 absolutely golden and extra crispy .
 i &apos;m taking criminal justice classes and many of them are taught by cops ,  ex-cops ,  and police chiefs .
 some of the police chiefs in particular have warned about this police culture and said they take active steps to avoid it and try to get away from the thin blue line idea .
 they &apos;re stand-up guys who encourage their officers to come forward when they see something shady and even punish those who don &apos;t come forward when they know someone &apos;s dirty .
 one of them repeatedly advised us to ,  if we became police ,  make sure we socialized with people outside of work ,  keep up hobbies ,  etc .
 because people do get sucked in and stuck .
 so it seems like some departments are catching on and improving ,  even if it &apos;s slow .
 serial killers be like  &apos;whoa whoa whoa i &apos;m not a fucking racist &apos;
 caveat to that ruling .
 if there are articulable facts that give rise to reasonable belief that another crime has been ,  is being ,  or is about to be committed ,  the mission of the seizure changes and the detention can be extended while those concerns are addressed .
 in the context of waiting for a k-9 ,  that could mean any observation that would reasonably lead an objective person to believe there was reason to suspect drugs or explosives in the vehicle .
 yeah ,  which is like ,  the slightest glimmer of hope .
  i feel like even just two years ago it would have been paid administrative leave .
 of course ,  they still might not be charged with anything ,  but so far .
 i &apos;m actually glad the spectators were calling them out really aggressively .
  i honestly wouldn &apos;t have done better .
  i don &apos;t know what the answer is .
 cop in bored voice:  &apos;i feel threatened .
 (blam-blam-blam-blam-blam-blam if you &apos;re darker than mashed potatoes .
 and we all know how accurate cops are .
 fuck those pigs .
  they deserve life in prison or a bullet .
 i tried to be a police officer but they didn’t hire me .
 i passed everything with flying colors .
 i am a infantry veteran and know my way around this kind of job .
 they lied about me doing paperwork wrong and didn’t hire me .
 i would throw everyone under the bus for corruption ,  nobody would be safe .
 i gave that attitude off .
 months later the chief gets fired for corruption ,  hmmm .
 you make a good point .
 i dont see why anyone would consider it now a days .
 plus the pay isnt even that good .
 i &apos;ll skip over the constitution which gets in the way of something like that .
 you should run for congress
 my department has a “no chase” policy unless it’s to pursue a person who committed a violent felony with a gun .
 the county will chase for fucking anything .
 we won’t even assist them if they come through our city .
 we just fuck off unless there’s a crash or a shooting .
 sadly they are held to a lower standard .
 it’s “settled” in court that a citizen not knowing something was illegal is not an excuse .
 so regular citizens are expected to know every law .
 but it’s also been shown that cops are not expected to .
 if they hold you for something that is completely legal bc they thought it was illegal ,  that’s not their fault .
 i was a paramedic for just under 10 years .
 i ran into one emt like that ,  he was eventually fired for assaulting a patient .
 a week later he was hired onto a police dept .
 a few towns over .
 yeah ,  that &apos;s not justice at all .
 we &apos;re not going to legally punish you for that time we murdered your life partner .
 not only that ,  the guy they were hoping to find was already in police custody
 lets not forget about duncan lemp .
 shot while sleeping in his bed with his gf in the house of his parents while police served a warrant .
 this occurs too many times with the police and trying not to sound like a nut but they need to be held accountable for their actions against other us citizens .
 not just fired or placed on leave ,  but charged with crimes like any one else would be charged with .
 i remember when the details first starting coming out ,  someone on here commented that they thought that the department only charged the guy so that they would seem like they were being  &apos;merciful &apos; or that they supposedly at least did something right when they drop the charges later on ,  making it easier to get away with not punishing any of the cops .
  they all think he &apos;s a great  &apos;defender &apos; of police .
  there &apos;s a reason he &apos;s the union president .
 reddit can pick up shit like a fart in a wind .
 yeah that whole situation terrifies me to the bone .
 its murder that point .
 breaking and entering while the inhabitants are sleeping then proceeding to shoot a woman in her sleep and charge the husband for her murder .
 i think that &apos;s what you &apos;re referencing right ?
 if not theres just so much more fucked up shit i want to hide from lol
 keep your hands on her head but also crawl toward me .
 when he was down on the ground with his hands on his head the officer should’ve approached him and handcuffed him .
 he was high on the power ,  this is serial killer shit dressed up in a badge and uniform
 it &apos;s genuinly the most disturbing thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
 i &apos;ve honestly been wondering about that lately .
 years ago i wouldn &apos;t have been in favor of vigilantes ,  and wanted peaceful protests .
 i feel like lately i &apos;ve been moving into the radical territory ,  and wouldn &apos;t cry if some of these cops turned up missing .
 yeah ,  attacking an armed murderer who &apos;s armed friends are close by .
 what could go wrong with that ?
 and a thought that shows without drastic ,  sweeping change ,  this sort of thing will continue .
 to say it fucking sucks is a criminal understatement .
 that &apos;s funny ,  i replied to the guy you &apos;re replying to and said most importantly ,  my dad who was le from the 70s through early 2000s ,  had tons of friends in his circle that had nothing to do with le .
 teachers and coaches ,  tradesmen ,  ranchers ,  musicians ,  etc .
 they were all pretty normal outside work ,  dressed normal and had normal people hobbies .
 any observation that would reasonably lead an objective person to believe there was reason .
 and that &apos;s an easy condition to meet .
  &apos;i smelled marijuana  ,  your honor .
 the mayor has specifically asked the da to charge them .
 i was infantry too and it’s events like this i can’t wrap my head around .
 like how can i as a marine ,  an infantryman show more restraint in a combat theatre overseas with all the roe’s and escalations of force ,  than a cop who’s job is to “protect and serve” .
 like we’d spend time in the brig for stuff like this ,  i don’t understand why cops aren’t held to same standard when they’re not meant to be soldiers but peace keepers .
 plus the pay isnt even that good .
 depends on where you live .
 i &apos;m in portland ,  or ,  and our city cops start at around $65k and can go way up from there .
 i had a friend a while back who tried for years to get on with them ,  with zero luck .
 unfortunately the department still pretty much sucks ,  but it &apos;s not for lack of pay or pre-hire screening .
 this is how terrorists are created .
 isn &apos;t it insane ?
 we live in a place where cops can kick the door of the wrong house in ,  shoot your family dead ,  and if you dare to shoot back ,  and somehow survive ,  you are charged as harshly as possible .
 it wasn &apos;t even the right house !
 and they killed someone .
 and not only did they get away with it ,  the guy protecting his family is on trial ?
 if we don &apos;t live in a police state i don &apos;t know what is .
 it &apos;d be a damn shame if the recorder got shot by accident ,  and they had to confiscate the phone as evidence .
 who knows maybe the phone gets destroyed and the recording is permanently lost .
 yeah ,  not everyone gets sucked in ,  but it does happen and can be hard for some to avoid so it &apos;s something to watch out for .
 i &apos;m glad your dad had a balanced life .
 i have no idea ,  it blows my mind too .
 i gave up on pursing that career as i would be too big of a threat for their bs .
 went into healthcare to continue helping people .
 i’d argue cops should be held to a higher standard especially because they are not soldiers .
 shit happens in war .
 sometimes you have to make a decision that everyone won’t understand .
 as a cop ,  you’re every decision should be defensible and above reproach .
 understandably ,  i must say .
 when the state is corrupt like in america (i know ,  some people won’t accept that truth) ,  justice falls in the hands of the people .
 or freedom fighters .
 it’s all perspective .
 yeah there’s no way i was gonna go leo after ,  all my friends who went that route lives went on the decline ,  all my friends that went firefighter on the other hand are really happy .
 studying for the mcat right now !
 i like talking into it and sounding like a robot
 i’m still waiting for my only fan so i can afford one
 im an average fan enjoyer
 it took me way too long to get this joke .
  i need more coffee .
 i can &apos;t have sex with an air conditioner .
 the sound of the fan drowns the deafening silence of dread in my life
 i used to have aircon ,  but then i switched to only using fan as it really helps me wake up better in the morning .
 my mouth is less dry and it makes waking up easier too since i wont drag my waking up from being too comfy .
 sweat is a free lubricant .
 i can deal with the downsides .
 the fan chops up the oxygen molecules and makes it more easier for me to suck em down .
 a silver for this comment ?
 i feel like that prostitute in pretty woman .
 unlock this answer for 70$
 i tried posting my foot pictures into the air con but the engineer kept looking at me weird when he had to come repair it for the third time .
 i &apos;ll call tomorrow .
 because an air conditioner won &apos;t show me it &apos;s butthole for 2 .
 costs too much on my power bill ,  i live on the ocean and the breeze is my air conditioner
 i &apos;m a mac user ,  so no windows .
 i think they don &apos;t need air conditioning ,  because they like to be naked .
 millions of years of evolution did not prepare me for this
 that took me longer than i &apos;d like to admit .
 since i rent there &apos;s not really a good place to put an air-conditioner .
 fans are more flexible and get the job done pretty well .
 the electricity bill
 ac can cause green house effect and i &apos;m doing my part in saving the earth .
 except when it is 34°c and above then my stand might waver .
 mine has a really solid fan base .
 i &apos;d like to hold on to that .
 i just open windows .
 my only fan™ model is still working well enough .
 i live in the uk .
 don &apos;t even have a fan .
 a few weeks each year (at most) it &apos;s hot and i ask my husband to agree to us buying a fan ,  every year he says it &apos;s not worth it .
 people saying they can &apos;t have sex with an airconditioner ,  how exactly do you stick your schlong on a super fast rotating machine ?
 if i &apos;m not hot ,  how will i make money ?
 england is what &apos;s stopping me lol .
 i hardly have to use the ceiling fan i have
 in the uk weather and temperature can vary so much that permanent air conditioning is too expensive to justify and air conditioning doesn’t come as standard in most homes .
 instead we have a good quality fan that we can use when the need arises .
 since sunny days are few and far between we just make do on really hot days .
 saving the planet ,  and my finances ,  win win .
 this dude is fucking his a/c unit
 because with an ac i can’t say “babe show me your butt hole” while also sounding like darth vader .
 i &apos;m from britain i only need fans on for like 2 months ,  air conditioning in a house is an alien concept to me
 i’m a simple man ,  i see tits and i subscribe .
 thought this was r/circlejerk for a sec .
 for shame on that subreddit for getting outdone .
 an air conditioner is nice and all ,  but it only blows you ,  it can &apos;t chop your dick so that &apos;s a disadvantage
 i sleep in the fridge
 i like the sound it makes when it &apos;s turned on
 it &apos;s way more portable ,  i can bring it to any room in the house and still be blown right away .
 we wanted to upgrade but the land lord wont allow it and now we are getting thrown out here so we are kind of happy we didnt drop any money on getting the ac installed
 i actually have only heater ,  but that &apos;s because it functions as both .
 my wife thinks she married a moron ,  don &apos;t want to dissapoint her .
 i am iron maaaaaaan
 that &apos;s good and all ,  but have you tried singing into it ?
 the one and only fan .
 aaaand this the comment that made me get the joke
 you could afford my only fan it’s free 
 i have only two fans .
 yeah ,  our electricty bill during summer is higher than winter ,  and we have a long cold winter .
  trying to manage when we let run the air conditionner and the fans so we can save a bit of money without burning the hell our appartment can be .
 in hawaii running the ac means the electric bill is at least $100 higher .
 that’s like half my car payment i can sit inside my car for ac if i want it so bad lol
 funnily enough my best friend has the reverse fear .
 they think they need the  central ac fan or overhead fan on or else they will suffocate .
 i’ve always wondered ,  does that apply to ceiling fans as well ?
 somehow i feel like they’re “safer” even though i don’t think standing fans will kill you either .
 loving all the ceiling fan injuries ,  but i was wondering if the fear of dying from having a ceiling fan on exists in korea ,  not about their actual danger !
 i read somewhere that fan death is used to cover a suicide as it is less embarrassing to the family .
 fun fact: fans cannot kill you in the us ,  their superpower is only activated in korea .
 crossing the border to north korea that superpower still remains .
 man ,  that altered item caused so much fuss .
 holy shit i &apos;m korean too and my mom would always tell me to open a window when i have my fan running .
 makes sense now
 last time i heard about this ,  i heard from one korean said that  &apos;asphyxiation from electrick fan &apos; was code for suicide ,  so that families wouldn &apos;t have to live with the fact that people know how that person died .
 i read this article 4 times and i still don &apos;t get it .
 i guess i don &apos;t understand flat earthers either .
 well my mom did tell me that i would die in my sleep if i slept with the ac on .
 cue to me crying as a kid at a sleepover party when her parents refused to turn off the ac when it was time to go to sleep .
 i woke up the next day surprised i was alive and decided to never believe in my mom &apos;s numerous korean superstitions !
 thought you talking about getting ur dick chopped off for a sec
 i love regional conspiracy stories .
 maybe i &apos;ll start collecting them !
 my korean coworkers were explaining this to me the other day ,  about how a lot of elderly folks believe it will upset your body temperature regulation and whatnot .
 it came up because i noticed a lot of our elderly korean and chinese  patients almost always request hot water to drink ,  without teabags or anything .
 i like when the fan blows air into my butthole
 virgin aircon user vs chad fan enjoyer
 i lokey love the silent fight between the fan and the mic compression
 i didn &apos;t realize it was a joke until you said it was .
 i am 1/4 into my coffee
 i assumed a lot of of girls were sweaty or something .
 and for some reason it was still funny to me with that interpretation .
 what &apos;s the joke ?
 i don &apos;t get it .
 lol thanks reddit !
  and yes i definitely didn &apos;t know about this site or what the hell all this was about .
 but had loads of fun reading the response .
 i was like “does everyone have electric fans in their videos or something ?
 what am i missing ?
 ” took me way too long !
 you don’t need coffee ,  you need an aircon .
 oh well ,  at least your mom is freon friday night
 sounds like you still have an r-22 unit my friend .
 ouch ,  look into a sustainable drop-in replacement freon .
 the options have gotten cheaper since the clean air act .
 this person’s account was made in 2012 and it only has this single comment in its post history .
 when i worked in the garage we had this older woman who was a regular customer who legitimately thought it was pronounced  &apos;freeze-on &apos; .
 she would come in and say  &apos;i think my air conditioner needs freeze-on it &apos;s not blowing cold &apos;
 name ,  freon is expensive .
 i feel like this gives more questions than answers .
 you can only get a blow job .
 you can literally do anything- at least once .
 not with that attitude .
 wait how you having sex with a fan ?
 that just shows you lack the creativity to get jiggy wit it .
 congratulations on being in a trio
 technically you can just make the hole bigger
 sire ,  don &apos;t speak the truth
 i miss the silence of dread .
 you never understand how peaceful quiet can be when you don &apos;t have it .
 especially the peaceful quiet when you don &apos;t have blood rushing through your ears and no heartbeat .
 so sleep in a lava pit and you &apos;ll have no problem ?
 also the mouth less dry thing might be because the air conditioning also dehumidifies .
 unsure if there are ways to mitigate that
  &apos;i prefer to be uncomfortable so i do not sleep well thus i wake up no problem .
 you’re right ,  sweat is a free lubricant ,  but your mom still makes me shower first
 yea man it &apos;s free and reliable made in a couple of hours
 yeah they turn the o2 molecules to 2 o molecules .
 one o for each nostril .
 nooooo you don’t understand how chemical bonds work !
 haha fan goes chop-chop
 everybody gangsta until three oxygen atoms bond back and create ozone that enters your lungs
 you aren &apos;t the prostitute in pretty woman ?
 i vaguely remember there being several .
 i keep sliding debit cards into my fan but it keeps slicing them up like they &apos;re oxygen molecules .
 i &apos;m almost out of debit cards ,  do you accept credit ?
 you &apos;ll call now .
 your fan has a butthole ?
 kowalski ,  speak american !
 what kind of back asswords fuckery is that .
 you need a permit to put an ac unit in your window ?
 they kind of blow .
 don &apos;t tell your mother my username .
 stepfather ,  what are you doing ?
 for some reason i read your comment as my night stand might waver
 do you mean the electricity used or the refrigerant inside leaking ?
 the irony is that subreddit is a circlejerk of people that hat circlejerkers
 hopefully she’s not an english major ,  then you might disappoint her with your spelling
 try doing double dutch bus from behind the fan .
 guarantee you she jumps on for a ride .
 he was turned to steel ,  in the great magnetic field
 i heard that in the fan voice
 shut up richard !
 im the baaaad guuuy
 one fan to rule them all ,  one fan to find them ,  one fan to bring them .
 all and in only land the fans bind them .
 i meant a air conditioner :)
 doing better than me
 pretty muchthe same situation here .
 appartment is pretty big and is in an old building with zero insulation .
 i tried air conditioning one summer and it literally doubled my electricity bill ,  which was already obscenely high .
 200$ for car payments ?
 what do you drive that seems really cheap
 they are also dehumidifiers by design ,  so that’s a huge plus on those horribly humid days .
 sometimes it’s just worth the cost of turning it on rather than suffering .
 rip to our pre-fan and pre-ac ancestors
 like ,  a cloud of co2 will build up around them from their own exhalations if there &apos;s no air circulation ?
 you ever been in an office building when the hvac goes out ?
  if there’s enough people in there it feels like you’re going to suffocate even in winter .
 ceiling fans are too big to chop up oxygen .
 (i mean they are but all fans are too)
 see i always have the fear that my ceiling fan whirling at the speed of sound might just fall off and crush me in the middle of the night .
 i remember staying at a hostel in san diego a few years back and there were two korean girls staying in the same room as me .
 they would wait till they thought everyone else was asleep and then turn the ceiling fan off .
 kinda sucked in the middle of july .
 (shout out to lucky d &apos;s)
 ceiling fans are just as dangerous as standing fans; which is a roundabout way of saying they &apos;re both not dangerous .
 ceiling fans aren &apos;t a thing in korea
 the paddles on ceiling fans are too thick compared to the blades of a normal fan ,  so the ceiling fan is all good
 i have a bunk bed ,  so the ceiling fan is something i have to be wary of .
 yes ,  hanging is a common suicide method in many parts east asia ,  thus the  &apos;death by asphyxiation ,  &apos; and the excuse is that the fan suffocates you if left on overnight .
 ohhh ,  could be ,  could be .
 other countries use  &apos;died peacefully in his sleep &apos; to cover for suicide ,  maybe worst korea and best korea should follow suit too .
 also used to curb energy consumption .
 it &apos;s just a very convenient propaganda tool .
 “fun fact: fans cannot kill you in the us .
 ” tell that to john lennon .
 now that is fascinating ,  i never thought to try that before .
 i wonder if there have been tons of editor wars between anyone who is bilingual and contributes to both articles .
 i don’t speak italian ,  what is the tone of the last article ?
 about the amanda knox one ,  that &apos;s some straight-up bs from the court system over there .
 you convicted two people wrongfully of murder and put them in jail with a sentence of 20 and 26 years ,  but then you find the actual murderer and send them to jail for only 16 ,  then let them off for community service ?
 community service for murder ?
 on february 1 ,  2020 ,  john kercher also died in violent circumstances ,  after a few days of agony ,  from being dragged by a pirate car in the croydon neighborhood ,  perhaps for a robbery .
 unless london has had some serious mad max shit go down i &apos;m the last year ,  i don &apos;t think  &apos;pirate car &apos; is the right word here .
 i hear the air is different in korea
 time to go touch a carousel horse and gain the ability to dodge
 i mean ,  it still doesn &apos;t but sure
 i never thought of it that way .
 i just might try that tonight .
 thank you kind stranger !
 yeah ,  older chinese people always drink hot water .
 it &apos;s partly because tap water isn &apos;t safe to drink in china and people are used to boiling water .
 forty years ago there were people who delivered freshly water in big thermos door to door because people didn &apos;t have taps in their house .
 it &apos;s also a traditional chinese medicine health thing .
 hot water is believed to actually lower body temperature when you &apos;re too hot and also warm you up when you &apos;re cold .
 my grandma always drank water scorching hot as soon as it boiled .
 she thinks room-temperature water is too cold and would never even think about drinking ice water .
 what &apos;d you do to your first cat ?
 sounds just like blowing across an empty moonshine jug
 insert shane dawson joke here
 what a terrible day to read
 you guys just convinced me to get out of bed as i &apos;m in the same boat .
 i &apos;ve been awake for 7 hours and i &apos;m on my third cup o &apos; - also didn &apos;t get it until i read it as well t_t
 the joke is that he’s talking about fans (that blow air) and not the dirty site you’re thinking of you pervert
 i am gonna start a high-end adult website and call it airconditioners .
 that &apos;s just cold .
 fuck you ,  shorsey !
 fuck you shorsey !
 damn ,  that &apos;s pretty good
 fuck you shorsey
 fuck you shoresy !
 my r2 unit had a bad motivator
 they could just have deleted their history .
 playing the long con
 there are people who run scripts that delete old posts regularly .
 i bet she was a monthly user ,  not knowing that there was a leak on her ac system .
 freon is expensive .
 trust me ,  you don &apos;t wanna know the answers to all of those questions .
 instructions unclear ,  dick stuck in ceiling fan .
 did anyone think to ask how the air conditioner feels ?
 maybe he puts it on reverse so he gets repeating dick slaps instead of dick slices
 i mean what do you think the cum presser’s function is ?
 not with that altitude .
 anything &apos;s a sex toy if you &apos;re brave enough .
 they tend to be very eager
 air conditioners were developed to be dehumidifiers (they condition the air !
 ) the fact that they cool stuff was an unintentional by product that turned out to be way more useful .
 it &apos;s actually not ,  just poorly explained .
 our bodies are conditioned to sleep when it gets colder and naturally wake up when it &apos;s warmer .
 this is why people generally sleep better in the cold .
 it &apos;s probably also why trying to wake up in a freezing room with an ac you feel a lot more  &apos;groggy &apos; than if the temperature naturally increased over night .
 fuck you shorsey !
 huh ,  that’s weird .
 how come she doesn’t make me shower
 i can produce sweat in seconds ,  either there &apos;s something wrong with you or there &apos;s something right with me
 yall only got 2 ?
 yeah ,  the bonds can be confusing ,  it’s o2 not double-o 7
 two chemists walk into a bar .
 the first one says to the bartender  &apos;i &apos;ll have an h2o &apos; .
 the second one says  &apos;i &apos;ll have a h2o as well &apos; ,  making sure to not have his order confused with h2o2 .
 the second chemist died anyway ,  because the bartender was a chemistry student who had been waiting his whole life for this .
 haha air go boom
 korean urban legend go bbbrrrrr
 ozone is a quantum chemical .
 the 3rd o atom simultaneously travels up each nostril ,  unless you observe it ,  in which case its wave function collapses and ,  if it &apos;s in your nasal passages you get a cold ,  in your lungs you get lung cancer (tb if it &apos;s o18 ) and leukemia if it is observed in the blood ,  possibly .
 i wish i had legs like that  .
 everything has a butthole if you &apos;re hard enough .
 it took me this far down in the comments to get op &apos;s joke .
 i need more coffee .
 2 eagle lifetimes above ¼ bald eagle temperature there is no point in buying
 if not installed properly they can fall out and kill people .
 i think every apartment i’ve been in just straight up banned them .
 you can still use the “portable” ones that only have their hoses in the window though ,  just not the actual window-mounted units .
 i still haven &apos;t gotten it .
 edit - finally got it .
 no they suck on one side and blow out the other
 it &apos;s too late honey ,  i found you .
 up selling you on an air conditioner .
 lol then i need to get a new solid ,  unwavering night stand .
 or the fact it blows out hot air in the already hot air which heats up the air even more !
 perfect name mate what kind
 all this tech enable me to correctly spell word &apos;s and my phone still likes to trip me up every so often .
 when he traveled time ,  .
 for the future of mankind
 aww ,  i &apos;ve interrupted happy time !
 i know i was being cute 
 winter we don &apos;t heat much and wear warmer clothes ,  but summer ,  it gets suffocating and my asthma flares up with the heat and humidity so it &apos;s kind of a must .
 when i was in situations like that i just got a window unit for my bedroom .
 i &apos;d make do with swamp coolers and fans during the day and then crank that ac up to 10 and make my bedroom an igloo before going to bed .
 you don &apos;t suffer through the worst part of summer: trying to go to sleep while stewing in your own sweat at night and don &apos;t have to pay for it as if you &apos;re trying to cool your whole house .
 you can lease pretty much any entry-level car for under $200/mo
 my impala is 230 a month .
 just don &apos;t buy brand new from a dealer like a noob .
 always wondered why all my great great ancestors are dead .
 well it depends on the speed of of said fans .
 ever fuck a ceiling fan ?
 have you ever replaced or installed a ceiling fan ?
 they &apos;re not heavy enough to crush you .
 especially if it &apos;s close enough in your bedroom that you can touch it when standing on the bed .
 it would be more of an  &apos;oof !
  &apos; situation ,  haha .
 probably some bruising .
 maybe some cuts from glass breaking (assuming it has lights) .
 i &apos;d imagine that your comforter/sheets would mostly protect from that though .
 the likelihood that it &apos;d fall is so slim as to be non-existent though .
 here &apos;s why: the wires are usually enough to hold it (especially if solid core copper wire--like is typically used for the grounding wire) and there &apos;s also usually a  &apos;thing &apos; (type depends on the fan) that will hold it up there while you &apos;re hooking up the wires .
 if the fan fell it &apos;d get caught on that pre-wiring hook/ball-holder thing before it fell on you .
 having said that .
 if you sleep under a huge industrial fan that &apos;s two or three stories up all bets are off .
 that would hurt a lot more ,  hehe .
 then again ,  those are usually attached much more strongly that house fans .
 ceiling fans typically weigh as much as a baby .
 could you handle a baby falling on to your chest from a few feet above ?
 then you &apos;ll be fine 
 why didn &apos;t you get up and turn it back on ?
 man ,  did the last quarter of your post disappoint .
 well yes ,  i understand that .
 i was curious about the perception ,  not the actual danger .
 in fact it seems from some replies like ceiling fans are more dangerous ,  just because they can fall down or you can hit your head on them if you’re tall .
 ironically ,   &apos;suicide &apos; is a common cover for  &apos;accidental death from autoerotic asphyxiation ,  &apos; especially among teenagers .
 it &apos;s super dangerous ,  don &apos;t do it .
 as a korean who never questioned why fans would be the suicide cover up .
 why did our ancestors never use  &apos;died peacefully in his sleep &apos;
 sounds like something someone’s dad would say .
 “also keeping the thermostat over 68 will give you leprosy .
 shut up and take my upvote you absolute monster
 oh ,  gosh ,  i &apos;d say good one ,  but  .
 poor john ,  trying to be nice to that kid .
 it calls it a myth in the opening line ,  but it does take a  &apos;teach the controversy &apos; approach but presenting both sides of the debate .
  i think it gives more and much stronger arguments from the  &apos;against &apos; side ,  though .
  also ,  almost all the linked articles at the bottom are from skeptics ,  with the  &apos;for &apos; side having no real support .
 nope ,  never heard of it ?
 the title of the japanese article for the rape of nanjing or the nanjing massacre is  &apos;the nanjing incident &apos; .
 then in the intro paragraph they say  &apos;the chinese side calls it the nanjing massacre or the nanjing massacre ,  but the truth of the case (discussed below) is still unknown &apos; .
 it then mentions discrepancy and controversy over the number of victims and scale of crimes .
 just judging by the title ,  i’d say it’s more assured of knox’s guilt .
 the english is “amanda knox” whereas the italian is “the homocide of victim”
 here &apos;s an example i found where the two articles sort of focus on different details in interesting ways: .
 english: a prolonged legal process ,  including a successful prosecution appeal against her acquittal at a second-level trial ,  continued after knox was freed in 2011 .
 on march 27 ,  2015 ,  italy &apos;s highest court definitively exonerated knox and sollecito .
 italian (machine translation): on 27 march 2015 ,  the fifth criminal section of the court of cassation ,  chaired by the councilor gennaro marasca ,  cancels without postponement the sentences of raffaele sollecito and amanda knox ,  acquitting them 6for not having committed the fact ,  affirming the lack of certain evidence and the presence of numerous errors in the investigations ,  and thus putting an end to the court case .
 the judge noted in particular the absence of traces of the two defendants in the murder room ,  also affirming the presence of knox in the house at the time of the crime (which she later denied) ,  but decreeing her non-punishment as conniving of guede ,  because does not participate in the homicidal action and is in a state of need  .
 it got death particles
 it was never proven
 yeah ,  i wanna know ,  too
 asking the real questions
 he said he likes when the fan blows air into his butthole .
 i should buy a boat
 the power of reddit .
 i &apos;m in the boat over and can confirm this person just got out of bed
 you sleep in a boat ?
 there &apos;s a dirty site about fans ?
 wow i’m an idiot .
 i’ve been scrolling this thread for the past 5-10 mins and just now got the joke
 lmao wow i’m slow .
 i came here expecting totally different comments
 maybe i’m just conditioned to it .
 fuck you it_dood !
 i fisted your mom so deep last night i thought i was auditioning to work on sesame street
 go give yer balls a tug .
 angry beeping noises
 i &apos;m not sure i even want to know the questions .
 that &apos;s the onlyfan you shouldn &apos;t have used .
 how do you have šex with fan ?
 why do you prefer fans over air-conditioners for šex ?
 what else have you had šex with before settling with fan ?
 why do you prefer fans over any other living thing ?
 do you have šex with fans while they are off ?
 what kind of lube do you use ?
 you just asked the first one
 fuck you shorsey
 to fuck up and cost me hundreds of dollars every fucking summer
 not with that platitude
 location location location .
 this is how you get thunderstorms in your bedroom .
 gonna need a dehumidifier for that humidifier in case it gets too muggy .
 they &apos;d better get a dedehumidifier just to be safe .
 i had a look on wikipedia it says .
 electricity made development of effective units possible .
 in 1901 american inventor willis h .
 carrier built what is considered the first modern electrical air conditioning unit15161718 in 1902 he installed his first air-conditioning system ,  in the sackett-wilhelms lithographing & publishing company in brooklyn ,  new york;19 his invention controlled both the temperature and also the humidity which helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment at the printing plant .
 later ,  together with six other employees carrier formed the carrier air conditioning company of america ,  a business which in 2020 employed 53 , 000 employees and was valued at $18 .
 cramer of charlotte ,  north carolina was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill .
 cramer coined the term  &apos;air conditioning &apos; ,  using it in a patent claim he filed that year as analogous to  &apos;water conditioning &apos; ,  then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process .
 he combined moisture with ventilation to  &apos;condition &apos; and change the air in the factories ,  controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants .
 willis carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company .
 so it looks like they were first developed to control temperature and humidity but that the name air conditioning originated specifically from someone who was more concerned about humidity control .
 the previous paragraph is even more interesting .
 the 19th century included a number of developments in compression technology .
 in 1820 ,  english scientist and inventor michael faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate .
 12 in 1842 ,  florida physician john gorrie used compressor technology to create ice ,  which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in apalachicola ,  florida .
 he hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings1213 and envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities .
 gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 ,  but following the death of his main backer he was not able to realise his invention
 dunno ,  maybe ‘cause my gran didn’t get me an axe spray gift set at christmas
 well damn nice dude you mind if i borrow some ?
 you have an extra hole ?
 i hate you ,  take my upvote
 convicted of murder and sentenced to death ,  his last words were “worth it”
 i don’t understand the joke .
 the bartender gave him h2o2 anyways just because he was that intent on finishing the joke even though the chemist didn’t say “h2o too” which would’ve sounded like h2o2 ?
 checks out ,  those are science words .
 the richard gere one
 looks like tomorrow &apos;s gonna be another scorcher !

 where is a free award when you need one
 while this is true and i do install a window air conditioner i feel like my top priority installing it is to not let it fall out the window .
 a distant secondary priority would be a good seal so no bugs but if it falls ou the window it will not operate properly after that .
 cumin ones ,  it &apos;s right there in the name .
 i know this is three weeks old but i ran into it today and i audibly laughed ,  thanks mate .
 it’s done on purpose if you correctly spell too many words the robot doesn’t like it and corrects it to an incorrect spelling .
 the bot thinks it’s more cleaver ,  by doing this ,  than the human !
 the bot internally chuckles when you press send without noticing the writ it made for you .
 then it notices the human talking into the fan and wonders what the hell was it worried about .
 these life forms made robots ,  flew to the moon in rocket ships ,  defied gravity with planes and see a fan and think oooo oooooooo i must talk into it .
 they clearly have to be inferior !
 nobody wants him
 winter is fine for me ,   more clothes or a blanket ,   but during the summer i can only get so naked !
 proceeds to rip off skin  .
 it &apos;s a lot easier to warm up than it is to cool off .
 i much prefer putting on another sweater than trying to cool off .
 i can only take so much clothing off before people start telling me i can &apos;t do that there .
 i can always put another layer on .
 indeed ,  they barely ,  barely had time to procreate before expiring from heat .
 they made  &apos;em tough in those days .
 those relativistic fans really do a number on your atmospheric composition
 wow thank you for this .
 i &apos;m not op but this put me at ease
 this comment does not apply to the big ass fans brand .
 they would so kill you 
 instructions unclear: threw baby into spinning ceiling fan
 there goes my fan assassination plan .
 thanks for nothing
 well now i have to acquire a baby ,  for science .
 one of the blades from my ceiling fan fell off and so the fan seemed unsafe .
 it’s much louder and shakes .
 so i haven’t used it .
  would that one blade missing effect  ?
 i know i should have my landlord fix it but he isn’t a fun man to deal with .
  ceiling fans typically weigh as much as a baby .
 could you handle a baby falling on to your chest from a few feet above ?
 then you &apos;ll be fine .
 i mean ,  no ,  but not because i &apos;m afraid of me getting hurt in that situation .
 which is really your point ,  but i digress .
 he &apos;s not a murderer
 robin williams was in a movie literally about this .
 he faked his son &apos;s suicide with his own suicidal thoughts to cover up the accidental death .
 it was one of the last movies he was in
 i &apos;ve heard people talk about that till they &apos;re blue in the face
 ah the david carradine sunday special .
 suicide is not a cause of death .
 it is the manner of death .
 these are limited to homicide ,  suicide ,  accident ,  natural ,  and a few others .
 the cause of death is the thing that actually causes the death .
 so let &apos;s say someone overdoses .
 the cause of death would say  &apos;acute complications due to the combined effects of heroin ,  fentanyl ,  para-fentanyl ,  4a-npp ,  and ethanol &apos; .
 the manner of death is determined by the circumstances in which those drugs got into the person .
 the circumstances might say something like  &apos;substance abuse &apos; .
 most overdoses like this are ruled an accident as the manner of death .
 so in your example ,  the teen who strangled themselves would always have the cause listed as  &apos;acute asphyxiation &apos;  the manner of death would be  &apos;accident &apos; and the circumstances might read  &apos;strangled by cord caught in an anchored motor &apos; if they were trying to be subtle .
 that &apos;s probably more than you wanted to know though .
 source: i &apos;m a registrar of vital statistics and death certificates are part of my job .
 constantly hearing about young ,  otherwise healthy people dying in their sleep for no reason could have a demoralizing effect on the population ( &apos;why bother trying in life when i could die any day now &apos;) .
 so instead they invented a bogus cause of death such that people could take some trivial preventive measures and feel more in control of their lives .
 i made that up completely but it makes sense in my head .
 so is john lennon .
 isn’t wikipedia still banned/blocked in turkey though .
 if so ,  the armenian genocide one makes sense as it’s more likely to be turkish dissenters rebelling against something their government’s blocked .
 apparently the ban was lifted in january 2020 ,  ignore me
 yo if he &apos;s out fucking cats ,  a  &apos;wonder &apos; goat might want to steer clear of this dude ,  just in case
 but i will avenge my earthly brethren

 sounds like a real hoe
 not without gratitude
 i didn &apos;t even remember it was his joke ,  but now that you mention it it seems obvious .
 he was gone far too soon .
 that name has been besmirched .
 i almost got excited
 this is how you get vortexes vortices .
 in 1842 ,  florida physician john gorrie used compressor technology to create ice .
 damn ,  so doc brown really wasnt messing with the space-time continuum too much when he built that ice maker in 1885 .
 fuck you shorsey ,  do you hear yourself ?
 thats it right there ,  that’s where the third hole is .
 covalent bond to friends
 license to chill .
 it &apos;s funnier if you &apos;ve heard the original version of the joke first ,  where the second chemist asks for  &apos;h2o ,  too &apos; and dies from drinking peroxide .
 this version subverts the punchline by having the second chemist not make that mistake ,  but the bartender ,  being familiar with the joke ,  is hell-bent on doing it anyway .
 your second sentence disproves your first .
  &apos;all in all it &apos;s just another dick in the wall &apos; - pink floyd
 it &apos;s time to make a hole
 look i have no idea
 it should be about 96 .
 4% of bald eagle temperature after adjusting the initial temperature scale into an absolute scale such as rankine or kelvin .
 1/4 bald eagle temp in fahrenheit is about 27 degrees fahrenheit so i think too didn &apos;t realize that an eagles body temp is about 106 fahrenheit not 106 celsius
 he &apos;s probably in his  &apos;lab &apos; right now .
 he just stares at the world
 nobody needs him
 i must have poor circulation or something bc i get so cold so fast .
 even in room temp my fingers and toes tend to go numb .
 it &apos;s either keep the heat on 24/7 or i &apos;m miserable lol  .
 my wallet is sobbing .
 ok now you have time worry about one of the fanblades snapping off and impaling you .
 i used to be worried about that all the time .
 yes ,  they are multiple horsepower motors and the wing tips are moving a few miles an hour even when set low percentage .
 full speed is only between 100-200 rpm ,  but some are 24ft across .
 those wing tips are really hauling .
 i thought you were joking so i looked it up .
 jesus christ they aren’t kidding .
 those fans are giant wtf
 does anyone have those in their bedroom ?
 who sleeps in a  barn ?
 i grew up playing soccer in ky and lexington’s best club team always hosted a tournament and the big ass fans building butted up against the complex .
 i always thought it was funny because it said “ass” lol .
 those things are big !
 i &apos;ll never forget my first encounter with a big ass fan .
 i only glanced at it and commented wow that &apos;s a big ass fan ,  my friend &apos;s dad was surprised i was familiar with them .
 i was confused .
 he was confused .
 i encountered one again years later ,  read the name ,  and audibly snorted laughing .
 with the right equipment and a lab partner you can make them !
 ceiling fan blades balance each other out when the motor is spinning them ,  so i would think it is probably not safe to operate with one blade missing .
 i also rent ,  and one of the blades fell off (metal attached to motor broke off ,  so just buying another set of blades wasn &apos;t an option) one of our ceiling fans and almost hit someone .
 when i told the landlord they had someone out the next day with a new ceiling fan .
 i &apos;m sure if you tell your landlord about an injury or potential injury if the fan isn &apos;t fixed ,  he &apos;ll get to replacing it pretty quick .
 this theory comes from a family member who has been a school therapist for a long time and at least two student  &apos;suicides &apos; in 30+ years of experience were actually this .
 it makes sense; teenagers are prone to risky behavior and bad decisions .
 way underrated comment right here .

 postmodernism means that there will only be meta-meta-jokes ,  mixed with at least three layers of irony ,  a fuckton of in-jokes and a healthy dash of obscure references ,  baked at 200°c for 45 minutes ,  seasoned to taste .
 see ,  i cant even be cynical without it devolving into some stupid cooking instruction parody .
 or pastiche ,   whichever word fits better .
 just now realized this is the right lyric .
 i won’t speak for the rest ,  but the song i specifically was referencing was iron man by black sabbath
 not a pet bird guy ?
 not to burst your bubble ,  but you need 18 inches (46 cm) clearance from the wall ,  or the turbulence will cause the fan to shake .
 didn &apos;t even think of that thank you !
 20 sucks for good luck
 i agree ,  some of those puns were fire af !

 i’m adjusting to the superheat though .
 that heatwave was a killer i tell ya
 i &apos;m not a fan of the way this thread is heading
 fuck you darktemplar26 !
 last night your mom was so wet ,  her pussy started singing ‘love is all around’
 bite me ,  in a sexual way
 suck on this subreddit
 stick my dick in a fan
 like after i close the app and come back or if i accidentally press the  &apos;back &apos; button and go to the top ?
 anyone else get so depressed when the page closes and you know you can never go back ?
 i &apos;d like to see how it works first  .
 i would feel great about no more “how would you feel” questions on this sub .
 just get apollo .
 i feel that these circlejerk type questions that start with  &apos;how would you feel .
  &apos; should be banned .
 ugh ,  we &apos;re doing these  &apos;how you feel about x for reddit ?
 someone please start the petition it is very necessary
 who the fuck would say no to this ?
 what a shitty post .
 how would you feel about banning low effort “how would you feel” questions from askreddit ?
 the same way as banning these questions .
 bruh stop with these questions ,  literally everyone wants it
 yeah ,  why isn &apos;t that a thing already ?
 i press back by mistake regularly ,  and that &apos;s generally when i &apos;m done with reddit for the day .
 you mean for when my phone just scrolls all the way to the top of the feed for no fucking reason at all ?
 reddit has become so circlejerky and hive-minded that it always is like that anyways
 idk how but i always accidentally press the logo to go back to the top just as i’m about to read something interesting
 yes ,  and maybe even a ,   &apos;are you sure you want to go back to top &apos; feature when you press back on keyboard/mobile so people don &apos;t need the  &apos;where you left off &apos; button
 could be bad for people posting/viewing nsfw subs
 thanks for reminding me this isn &apos;t a feature and giving me anxiety .
 just set it to hide any posts you either up voted or down voted and refresh whenever you want .
 bam ,  endless stream of fresh posts .
 this happens and i just figure it &apos;s time to fall asleep .
 no way i wanna wake up to all the weird shit i was reading about at 2am the previous night
 or an option for posts to disappear from your feed once you up or down vote .
 it &apos;s called red reader .
 latest version has some nice new features ,  too .
 sometimes it takes a while to load .
 but it caches things ,  so no more than a few seconds if you &apos;re really really far down the infinite scroll .
 given how othen i have to force close the app from its issues ,  yes please give me this .
 i’d prefer it if the feed just reset when i refreshed rather than just randomly when it fucking wants
 ironically i accidentally hit back twice and found this at the top .
 yes i would love that !
 i feel like a mode where all my porn subreddit subscriptions are only viewable at night would be a better investment
 how i feel about it ?
 pretty cool idea .
 i think it would be great if apps like reddit and facebook had a way of managing certain things - like jumping back to the post feed that accidentally got refreshed ,  or even a history of post feed that have been presented to you would be a step further .
 this feels along those lines to me so i &apos;d be all for it
 since this isn &apos;t really a question (who on earth wouldn &apos;t) ,  i &apos;ll take a moment to recommend the apollo app for ios .
 it has that feature along with many others the official products don &apos;t have .
 a bug was recently discovered and was fixed within days .
 hitting the scroll to top button accidentally is part of the reddit experience .
  reddit is a harsh master .
 we would call it the “fuck go back” button
 plot twist: op is a reddit developer and is asking us if we want the update
 why would i care for it on reddit ?
 i feel asleep at some point during 2019 and would like to return to that ,  please
 ask us if we would like to have every action on this platform tracked and aggregated as a user level .
 because that’s what this requires .
 sometimes when you click on a post and exit ,  it would put you in a different spot than before which is annoying
 literally every other social media app i use has it ,  it would be great .
 i &apos;ll take your entire stock
 if i can remember where i left off on reddit ,  that would be nice .
 how would you feel about something that has literally no fucking downside- people on this subreddit
 and relive my 3am madness in the morning ?
 hi i am a reddit user and i approve of this message .
 oh man ,  this and a feature that lets me organize my saved posts .
 something where i can more easily figure out what i &apos;ve saved ,  maybe group by custom categories or by sub ,  give me something so i dont have to scroll down for hrs on my app to see a post i saved a year ago .
 i’d prefer a ‘don’t show me posts i’ve seen before’ button .
 seriously ,  how difficult would it be ?
 reddit knows every post we’ve seen / scrolled through / upvoted / downvoted .
 just have a checksum for images and videos ,  and remove those from our feed that are in our existing viewed content database
 how about a no one allowed to comment under the age of 16 ?
 it is so incredibly frustrating that as you been scrolling for a while .
 and you leave for one minute you have to start over .
 usually i dont bother anymore then
 i hate it when you leave the app for so long that it has to reload but the last page you were on isn’t in your history
 slap me in the face and take my money .
 just give it to me .
 you can stick this right up your functional search bar .
 yes please but i’d be happy if it didn’t go to the top if i breathe on the left side of my screen
 wait ,  why hasn’t this been done yet ?
 i think it &apos;s a great idea ,  but reddit should consider a working video player first lol
 your ideas are powerful ,  keep honing it for good .
 fucking do it i &apos;ve lost so many great posts because my phone is laggy and the app will either freeze or stutters and refresh .
 i am not screaming at you ,  but it would be useful .
 how about a fuck go back button for when i accidentally hit the back button on my phone and it takes me all the way to the top
 i just want a stable functioning official app .
 i had no problem with the app a couple of months ago ,  but ever since they introduced profile pics ,  they keep fucking it up .
 the profile pics also keep going away and coming back after each update but that &apos;s the least of the apps worries .
 now whenever you scroll right and hit a video ,  the whole thing auto expands and freezes so you don &apos;t even know what subreddit you are stuck on .
 i &apos;d go on my friends phone and go to a gay subreddit just to mess with him when he decides to go to where he left off
 i like that idea .
  i &apos;d also like a  &apos;don &apos;t go down that rabbit hole electric zapper &apos; to protect myself from going down too many rabbit holes .
 that would be great
 how about a hide shit you’ve already seen button .
 i just want a proper working search function .
 this would be awesome .
 i’ve so often tapped the home button or the top of the screen showing my girlfriend memes i come across ,  it’d be so nice to be able to press the home button again and it goes back to where i was before i fat thumbed it .
 op crosspost this to r/beta and it’ll probably get added in .
 they’ll see all the comments on here
 might not be necessary if reddit had an actual ,  functioning search bar .
 i’ve become comfortable with the ephemeral .
 it’s not possible to see everything so i get the chance to enjoy what comes up without it feeling inevitable .
 were this to be implemented ,  i fear i’d start hoarding posts and needing to read every post or get anxious from having not “completed” all of the unread posts/having a large backlog to get through .
 my enjoyment of the content would suffer .
 i may be late to the party but ,  on the official reddit app on my phone ,  there is a  &apos;history &apos; tab(button ?
 ) to see your recent well .
 sauce: i am posting from the  &apos;history &apos; option .
 are you offering to program one in ?
 great considering that it just happened to me and this is the first thing i saw
 that &apos;d be a blessing from the gods ,  right ?
 why don &apos;t they just give a final conformation before we want to refresh ?
 just like a little quick save of your place ?
 possibly being able to name it if you so choose but probably not ?
 yeah ,  i &apos;d be down
 i need a save article button or some way to search .
 there was an article i saw that i wanted to find again .
 it was an ask reddit question to blind people and what they found attractive about their partners or how they knew they were attracted to someone .
 can anyone  help ?
 i feel like your just asking for upvotes since you know how everyone wants this jk lol i would love it
 he is the messiah
 nah ,  i love clicking to read an article and then going back to find the post  has completely vanished .
 the fuck does this have 100k upvotes .
 everyone has said it before ,  long before ,  and everyone knows .
  &apos;here we go again &apos;
 i would pay for it (not really but i would send thoughts and prayers)
 i &apos;d feel good ,  but i &apos;d feel better if my page wouldn &apos;t erase everything on it or re-order it into oblivion every time i accidentally refresh mobile .
 let me click something to bring in new threads .
 how about a never see the same post twice and filter out all reposts feature ?
 i just realized that this is one of the few posts here with 100k+ upvotes .
 if i posted the same ,  no one would see it .
 there &apos;s a history of posts you &apos;ve looked at lol
 i would love it !
 i always lose my place and it’s really annoying
 i just want to know who would actually be opposed to this
 i’d like that ,  sometimes i can’t remember a post for the life of me and want to see it again but i had to exit the app because of something going on outside .
 i’m relatively sure i’d cry if that became an option .
 i’m forever either hitting the wrong button or it glitches and kicks me off .
 agreed need a return icon
 honestly ,  does no one know that you can change your settings to hide posts that you’ve upvoted or downvoted ?
 i &apos;d be happy if it would stop bouncing me up to the top of the page at random times for no apparent reason .
 i’d rather be able to block certain subs
 i get so disgusted when i accidentally get sent back to the top ,  i just close out of the app .
 they shouldn &apos;t add that so people can farm this exact post over and over for awards and points
  i like the travolta in pulp fiction gif feeling
 i would just wish i had left off in 2015 .
 honestly ,  reddit is so time consuming that sometimes the odd take-me-back-to-the-top-of-the-page-so-that-it-is-physically-impossible-for-me-to-return-to-where-i-was can be a good motivation to close the app and deal with my life .
 depending what app you use ,  there should be a  &apos;hide on read &apos; setting .
 complete game changer .
 never have to scroll through pages and pages of stuff you &apos;ve already seen ever again .
 reddit is fun has an option to go back to where you were when you accidentally press back .
 i think it could be nice to have it work for both
 there &apos;s a  &apos;recently viewed links &apos; section in the bottom right
 you can press ctrl + shift + t if your on chrome
 my cat has booped my phone causing a reddit reset ,  many times .
 can &apos;t even get mad at him
 you can see your history right ?
 but at the end of the day eather i like it and use it or i don &apos;t like it and forget about it  .
 what &apos;s the worst that could happen .
 i &apos;d imagine it works like:     .
  &apos;oh ,  you left your browsing on this thread ?
 here you go ,  browse on &apos;      .
  &apos; oh ,  you left the stove on ?
 no problem ,  we &apos;re all gonna die anyways &apos;
 hide posts you’ve already seen .
 apollo has a feature to hide all posts above the one you’re reading .
 or use the setting built into reddit that hides upvoted/downvoted posts and vote on everything .
 hope you’re a beta tester
 they &apos;ll just release it without warning in an unfinished state .
 make sure you don &apos;t end the session on a nsfw post .
 download tumblr ,  they have one .
 scroll down ,  then press home .
 you’ll see the home button turns into a down arrow .
 press the down arrow and it’ll return you to where you were .
 at least i assume that’s what this post is referring to ,  hopefully i’m not off the mark
 reddit is fun already has it .
 it doesn &apos;t apply to every time you change screens ,  but it &apos;s still amazing .
 you would have to have some interaction with the post or sub such as opening the post or even an upvote .
 i imagine if you’re scrolling and accidentally hit back to top ,  you could then hit ‘return to feed’ button it will send it to down the feed to the last post you upvoted .
 let me give you the results .
 half of redditors love it the other half hates it .
 or ,  it just exists and you use or don &apos;t .
 what is there to test ?
 if it &apos;s implemented as an option you can just disable it ?
 no need for a test
 it has this feature and  it works great .
 if not in life at least on reddit .
 i can open a post and maybe 30 seconds later i &apos;ve scrolled through the comments and i have no memory of what the original post was
 apollo app for reddit does that
 i was literally about to comment “yes please”
 just type a popular opinion with  &apos;how would you feel &apos; at the begining and watch as redditors spray karma all over your slutty karma whore face
 weren &apos;t they banned ?
 how would you feel about getting $100 , 000 , 000 , 000 for having sexy sexed sex ?
 ffs this whole thread is an echo chamber how tf is this one of the most popular posts rn
 yeah but how would you feel about starting a eugenics program (allowing only smart people to have kids) ?
 how would you feel about never having to work a day in your life again but getting paid triple your salary right now ?
  &apos;how would you feel about .
  &apos; =  &apos;can you agree with me on this opinion that practically everyone agrees with and upvote my post ,  please ?
 also  &apos;your username is .
 i swear these questions got banned a few months back .
 sure but i need “would you for a million dollars .
 ” and “what’s something men/women do that’s attractive” questions every two minutes or i’ll physically die
 it shouldn &apos;t be hard to automod auto remove any post that starts with  &apos;how would you feel &apos;
 i could &apos;ve sworn they &apos;d been banned
 especially when it’s incredibly popular opinions like this .
 that way no more karma farmers
 how would you feel about this idea with literally no down sides ?
 i was wondering why everyone has their panties in a bunch when i’m not having any of their problems .
 i &apos;m out of the loop .
 apollo is the way
 if people aren’t using apollo in 2020 then they’re fucking up .
 i remember alien blue used to do this ?
 i was looking for this
 how would you feel about insanely popular opinion ?
 i &apos;m pretty sure they were banned a couple years ago .
 no idea how they came back
 how does that make you feel ?
 plus who the fuck would say no to this ,  this is such an uninteresting question
 this is the petition
 the front page updates all the time ,  posts are always moving about ,  new posts appearing and old ones dropping off .
 going back to like page 5 from yesterday serves no use ,  because new posts have been made .
 even if you just leave it a few hours and refresh ,  the front page will have new posts .
 ikr ,  didn &apos;t they ban these around december ?
 and who would ever say no to any new function ?
 bring me back to life  .
 there &apos;s no new reddit in ba sing se
 this is already a part of old reddit .
 just don &apos;t have endless scrolling enabled and you &apos;re good to go .
 new reddit is the worst shit ever .
 it’s annoying when some subreddits automatically go to new reddit .
 it’s an awful design and there are way too many ads .
 now this i can relate to
 this isn &apos;t a sub for petitions !
 or you could stop using the shit official version like normal people .
 reddit is fun has had this for years .
 apollo app for iphone has this feature
 i was gonna say ,  i sometimes feel this already happens on my nsfw browsing account .
 well on the apps that already have this ,  it &apos;s an option that is a small pop up that &apos;s on the bottom of the screen .
 you can just ignore it if you don &apos;t want to go back this time ,  or turn it off altogether .
 the only place the official app is better is all the exclusive features because they closed down the apis or simply don &apos;t make them for third party apps .
 thanks man ,  i didn &apos;t expect that .
 how do you do that
 this is a setting already ,  accessible from the desktop site !
 isn’t that already a setting ?
 i was wondering what op was on about ,  as a redreader user myself .
 i think the new version from a day or two ago that automatically reloads old comments is a bit annoying ,  because i like it when cached comments load instantly ,  and hope something will be done in the future to fix it ,  but generally ,  it works quite well ,  especially with images and video .
 i vote this one .
 wow i never knew that !
 there &apos;s a save post button on the app .
 but i agree with searching .
 if i want to find something specific here i google it with reddit in the search .
 there &apos;s been many a time i &apos;ve found a great new sub and then thought  &apos;how exactly do i find what i &apos;m looking for here ?
 what’s up calamity boy
 there &apos;s a  &apos;hide &apos; button i use constantly ,  that way i can get rid of articles i &apos;ve already read or i have no interest in reading .
 so when i refresh my main page it always has new content .
 there &apos;s also a  &apos;saved &apos; button for anything i want to return to later .
 i don &apos;t think people are using the current features to their full potential .
 baconreader has a  &apos;hide read posts &apos; setting that works great
 you can also hide posts you’ve up/down voted ,  then you refresh and you start right back where you left off .
 the reddit mobile app .
 yes there are a million other apps that can hide read ,  but i like the reddit app - well except those idiotic floating flames that make you skip the comment - and these two things ,  a back where you left off button ,  and hide read ,  would make my life complete
 #1 reason i use baconreader .
 in use reddit is fun and it hides stuff that i &apos;ve upvoted/downvoted .
 i just upvote everything i see so it goes away ,  unless it &apos;s worthy of a downvote or i want to see it again .
 it works surprisingly well ,  it &apos;s one of the reasons i refuse to download the official app .
 i am not seeing it .
 i &apos;d love it if this were actually revamped a bit .
 show a longer history that lets us rifle through it .
 and maybe make it so that it also shows pages we visit on our other devices ?
 there have been a few moments where i found a really interesting discussion on my phone ,  only to go to my desktop and have trouble finding the same thread .
 that &apos;s why i can &apos;t stand this  &apos;infinite scroll &apos; obsession lately .
 i like going back page by page to check old posts and easily keep my place when i hit  &apos;back &apos; or the app crashes or my device reboots or any number of other things .
 trying to read the first post in a long set on tumblr ?
 better get to scrolling and hope you don &apos;t get any interruptions !
 every time i view a reddit post in browser it proudly proclaims  &apos;use our app for must-have features like infinite scroll &apos; and i &apos;m just like .
 does anyone actually like that ?
 i &apos;m sure it &apos;s better for advertisers but fucking stop .
 i’m confused reading it .
 is it some depressed chick ?
 could you explain ?
 i have no clue what this mary is .
 for ios /r/apolloapp is awesome .
 if you tap to scroll up ,  then tap again ,  it scrolls back
 reddit is fun allows you to go from thread to thread within the comments so it usually only takes me a minute or two .
 it might work for you .
 hey can you not post on apollo or am i doing something wrong ?
 used it ,  came to love it ,  tried to make a post and there wasn’t even an option to write one .
 a little voice inside my head said ,   &apos;don &apos;t look back .
 you can never look back .
 i think you already have a  &apos;return to where i left off &apos; button ,  and just used it to reply to yourself 45 minutes later .
 users always say they want more features .
 if you ask them if they want something they always say yes .
 then when the devs add a bunch of features and people stop using it ,  they can &apos;t articulately explain why ,  but they say say other apps feel better to use .
 what users actually want are tightly designed products that are designed to be used the way they want to use them .
 they don &apos;t want to sit at a giant control panel of options .
 and the devil of the thing is ,  they don &apos;t know that &apos;s what they want .
 i love when people say  &apos;whats the worst that can happen &apos; .
  well they could set up an update ,  but the update crashes all of reddit ,  blows up your phones and labtops when we try to log on .
  there are no more phones in the world .
  the aliens know this and invade earth and enslave us .
  now we work for them .
 last time i requested a  &apos;return to where you left off &apos; button ,  the usa almost started a world war with iran ,  coronavirus happened ,  and a black man was killed for having a bad check .
 worst thing that can happen is they put time and effort into a feature that sucks .
 and they could have put that time and effort into features that don &apos;t suck .
 apollo also has a return to where you were feature if you accidentally scroll to the top .
 tapping the top bar does it both ways .
 keeps me breathing
 whoever programmed this life app had no clue what user experience is .
 i &apos;d give it one star but then - there &apos;s nowhere to even rate this bloody app .
 there &apos;s one in life .
 it &apos;s called a defibrillator
 if not on reddit ,  at least in life ,  which will probably be easier than on reddit
 i rly need one for life
 i &apos;d go a step further and want a return to last checkpoint in life .
 it &apos;s in the way that you use it
 i &apos;m stoned as well .
 you &apos;re goddamn everywhere and i can &apos;t be mad about that
 i had to google some of these words .
 you always leave me in awe ,  u/poem_for_your_sprog .
 sometimes i think you are a bot who eats crosswords for breakfast .
 be careful ,  this sprog is still a bit hot out of the oven
 quickest i’ve ever seen a sprog .
 what a day it’s been .
 and some idiot gave this question a plat .
 like really ,  you &apos;re going to toss $6 into the middle of the circle jerk ?
 your post karma is so big !
  &apos;how would you feel about having good thing ?
 86 thousand upvotes ,  2 platinum ,  8 gold ,  17 silver
 poor people of reddit ,  how would you feel about getting a million dollars no strings attached ?
  &apos;how would you feel if cooking blogs didn &apos;t have long recipe introductions ?
  &apos;how would you feel if microtransactions were banned in mobile gaming ?
  &apos;how would you feel if action movies didn &apos;t use shaky cam ?
  &apos;how would you feel if tencent was barred from doing business in america ?
  &apos;how would you feel if youtube didn &apos;t demonetize your favorite channels ?
 how am i doing ?
 please rate how plugged into the circlejerk i am from a scale of 1 to 10 .
 people constantly asked  &apos;how would you feel about banning how would you feel questions &apos; lol .
 six hours later: how would you feel about giving $100 , 000 , 000 , 000 for having sexy sexed sex ?
 sexxitors of sexxit .
 lurkers upvote anything they  &apos;like &apos; without knowing/caring about context or what makes reddit more useful .
 hence the same post on like 10 subreddits ,  none of which really fit the subject - it &apos;s just  &apos;neat &apos; .
  am i a smart people ?
 second apollo user in the chain
 granted ,  reddit is a heavily american site ,  so there &apos;s a good chance that the ios number is higher among reddit users .
  &apos;rif is fun &apos; is the app i have used on android since before the official app came out .
 it works fantastic ,  and has the  &apos;forward &apos; feature whenever you accidentally go back .
 it’s an app that has features that the reddit app doesn’t have .
 go back to where you were ,  clear posts you’ve already seen from your feed ,  custom app icon ,  stuff to help you type and format your posts without having to look at reddit formatting ,  gif scrubbing ,  you name it .
 the creator of the app is an awesome man and listens to the community .
 i highly recommend you get it .
 alternative reddit app .
 so much better than the default app .
 only on ios though .
 rif is the thing i missed the most about getting an iphone .
 apollo came out a few months later and is the closest app that itches that scratch .
 both apps are in my opinion the best way to use this website .
 used to be a sync guy myself but i went to rif so i could have a reddit app without endless scroll
 i use redditisfun app .
 always been a good layout for me
 basically r/unpopularopinion but in the form of a question .
 how wuld u fel if jef bezos had to give everyone in the world fiv dollars ?
 use this as a petition !
 how would you feel about solving world hunger ?
 hahaha how would you feel about not getting punched in the face every day for the rest of your life ?
 so my upvote counts as a signature then ?
 what ,  i thought this was a very serious question on a dividing subject to spark discussions ,  and not an effortless pandering karmawhoring post !
 it &apos;s already fucking implemented in any half decent app that allows  &apos;hide read posts &apos; .
 this whole post is incredibly stupid .
 this isn’t even an opinion .
 the answer is just “i support it”
 here we are safe .
 here we have memes .
 i &apos;m pretty exclusively mobile ,  didn &apos;t know .
 i’ll give it a try .
 ah ,  a man of culture i see
 if i saved everything i thought was interesting it would fill it &apos;s own subreddit
 i hide all my good porn stuff on hide so i can go back to them .
 “history” -- “seen ,  upvoted ,  downvoted ,  hidden” — “good stuff”
 they really aren &apos;t .
 never thought to do this so thank you for the suggestion !
 yeah that &apos;s the app i &apos;ve always used and it &apos;s great
 pc ,  might be a res thing
 click on your icon and there’s a “history” bit in the slide out menu ,  reddit app mobile
 click the save button .
 i honestly really like infinite scroll .
  if it ever gets to the point where i &apos;ve scrolled that far that losing my place would mean scrolling through hundreds of posts again ,  then it probably means i &apos;ve spent way too long mindlessly scrolling reddit and should do something else .
 god tumblr( especially the app) has always been a nightmare to navigate
 i &apos;m really confused too and i found it disturbing ,  and she &apos;s got 15k followers
 i thought i knew what love was !
 if i had one i wouldn &apos;t be on reddit ,  i &apos;d be the richest human alive by gambling and knowing the future
 shit went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick
 you need to pass the joint tho
 an update triggers the collective reddit hivemind posts into becoming a sentient self-optimizing ai with two goals:   .
 1) turning all matter of the universe into a computing platform with optimal efficiency ,  and   .
 2) transfering the brains of all beings capable of pain into digital versions ,  copied into as many instances the universe computing platform can handle ,  where these digital sentient beings are tortured with optimal magnitude until the heat death of the universe .
 and the firmware updates are getting worse every year .
 i mean ,  who the hell needs a back pain feature ?
 i hate how it &apos;s pay to win
 bruh the 2020 update really changed how the game is played
 maybe we’re all living in life 1 .
 0 and once the universe runs it’s course they’ll take it back to the studio and make upgrades on it for the next instalment
 don &apos;t need a save button when the game autosaves every nanosecond
 there ya go pissin off god again honestry 2020 was enough
 elon musk is working on state saves as we speak .
 i thought we sorted this out ,  save states are a bad idea
 sure there is ,  you rate this life app with contributions :)
 i can &apos;t get out of this strangers van now .
 the life app is stupid .
 forces me to pay for everything .
 the friend npcs have a glitch where they completely ignore me .
 my character is also way too ugly ,  no avatar change option ?
 it’s like gta ,  you save and recharge health everytime you go to sleep
 you didn &apos;t have to click  &apos;hardcore mode &apos; you know right ?
 were just testing it out before its released to the public !
 still buggy though .
 its not 100% guaranteed it will work
 me too and once i read these two and liked them i completely forgot what this post was .
 still no idea after typing this
 oh boi i cant wait to eat some crosswords !
 for a lot of us with reddit premium we have coins out the ass and nothing to spend it on so tossing a platinum on a post doesn &apos;t mean too much .
 “oh yeah ,  slide your post all the way up my front page .
  oh god it’s hot .
 “i would like good thing” .
 15 thousand upvotes ,  5 gold ,  10 silver
 how would you feel about banning how would you feel about banning how would you feel questions ?
 yeah lurkers also upvoted anything that makes them laugh in any sub
 statistically speaking ,  no .
 i use apollo and have seen people mention it ,  but what’s the back command/button ?
 reddit on the whole ,  app and website has a feature  &apos;hide posts i &apos;ve voted on &apos; .
 also carries over if you use the app and browser .
 i &apos;ve been using the official reddit app for awhile now and haven &apos;t had much issues .
 but they recently changed it so awards show up like right under up and down vote .
 so i keep accidentally going to the give gold screen .
 i &apos;ll give apollo a shot .
 if you &apos;re on andriod ,  sync is the way to go .
 you can change every font ,  textbox ,  background color ,  post color ,  comment color ,  post style ,  post size ,  scroll type ,  literally anything you can think of you can customize .
 i made a total blackout theme .
 there are no borders on posts or comments ,  its just pure black with white text .
 blends in perfectly with the black header and black page controls at the bottom .
 the only color comes in on the colored comment level indicators and hyperlinks but you can technically change that too .
 i only got a pc .
 oh man rif isn &apos;t on iphones ?
 for me i found slide to be the best replacement for rif with apollo coming in second on ios
 and less conservative circlejerking
 wow ,  that subs fucking awful .
 unpopular opinion threads and the sub just don &apos;t work on reddit ,  because majority of people on reddit don &apos;t have a fucking clue that ,  in such a thread or sub ,  you &apos;re supposed to upvote unpopular opinions as per the topic .
 to be fair ,  the questions here are a little less racist .
 omg let &apos;s use this as a petition .
 good to quite good .
 best part is that question would gain traction and get a shit load of upvotes .
 well no ,  of course yours doesn &apos;t count ,  but everyone else &apos;s does .
 me too ,  but it &apos;s definitely worth logging in on your desktop once to enable it since the feature still works on mobile .
 i tried googling for you but apparently several variations of the question have been asked and i haven &apos;t got a clue how to make a link on the app .
 there are shortcuts you can use like save to evernote ,  i like it :) i don &apos;t always remember to look but i like knowing that it &apos;s there .
 plus i &apos;ve started using it as a sort of way to track moments of history .
 res allows you to categorize things you save to keep them organized i believe .
 but i honestly don &apos;t save enough to use that feature .
 content on this site is getting less and less interesting to me .
 it &apos;s still a thing on old reddit .
 i &apos;m not seeing a recently view thing anywere .
 mind taking a screenshot ?
 most third party apps have it as well .
 sync does for sure .
 that worked really good ,  thanks for the tip !
 the only thing i don &apos;t like about that is that it shows everything you scrolled past ,  and not just the ones you clicked on .
 holy shit this is a game changer
 yeah but doesn’t that just go to the posts you already saw ?
 yeah i do here and there .
 but sometimes i forget ,  or don &apos;t think about saving ,  only to wanna look up the article/conversation later .
 it would just be helpful to be able to see more than a handful of threads on the history .
 sure ,  but if you’re trying to read a long series over the course of several days or longer ,  you’re all but guaranteed to lose your place a few times .
 it &apos;s /r/creepypasta stuff .
 she does a youtube series where she produces her own series of  &apos;scary &apos; videos .
  well edited ,  but basically just the same jump scare over and over from the little i watched .
 if you were rich you wouldn’t be on reddit ?
 i didn &apos;t know that there was the option
 and the firmware updates are getting worse every year .
 two old legs with creaking knees -   .
 thumbs that crack ,  and lungs that wheeze -   .
 arms that shake ,  and eyes that blur -   .
 hands a ghost of what they were .
 two old ears that strain to hear -   .
 lips a shade of yesteryear .
 i think that one is definitely a bug .
 it &apos;s almost as if they want to push us to upgrade to a newer device .
 and like ,  then you reach 100-ish years and all of a sudden your os is deprecated .
 my hardware works just fine .
 i don &apos;t need a new set of teeth ,  ffs .
 i got a cheap chinese knockoff 50 years ago and it works fine !
 i &apos;m pretty sure the floor is farther away each time i bend over .
 not getting any taller ,  though .
 i think this is a bug in urgent need of fixing ,  if this is normal game mechanics it &apos;s an awful feature .
 there &apos;s an add-on called gym ,  hit it and see if it disables this back pain feature .
 i think the devs might have done this to nerf the human build a little bit ,  but failed miserably .
 i got the pro version that sporadically jams bamboo under your finger nails
 it &apos;s planned obsolescence .
 that way you &apos;re forced switch to a newer model after 7-9 decades .
 hah ,  you’re lucky ,  this model introduced back pain 30 years ago !
 in the interim i’ve inadvertently downloaded the dlc for random headaches ,  sight loss and despair .
 21 seemed to be the most stable and with a lot of promising future updates ,  but it hasn &apos;t been the same since then .
 there wasn &apos;t nearly as many generated sexual encounters or career aspirations like what the devs intended .
 they should give _me_ stars as a spare change .
 horrible ,  horrible app .
 what are the odds ?
 sadly ,  that &apos;s the only thing i aced in this shitty game .
 graphics are kinda nice tho tbh
 ngl i don &apos;t really like multiplayer but ever since it got removed i &apos;ve been missing it more and more
 and most importantly ,  why ?
 i didn’t get the memo .
 the devs need to get on this
 return to where you left off button
 we read books ,  he eats books
 i felt like i should reply with something funny and clever here to subtly imply that you should send some my way if you have more than you know what to do with ,  but i couldn’t think of anything so this giant run-on is what came out .
 well if it doesn &apos;t mean too much .
 if you are feeling up to it .
 you might want to .
 help a brother out ?
 oh wow just realized u actually gave me one lmao .
 ok so do you ever accidentally hit the top and you go back to the top of the page ?
 just hit the area where the time is on your phone and you’ll go back to where you were !
 also ,  in the settings ,  there’s a button that you can select that can hide all the posts you’ve seen .
 unless you vote on every post ,  i wouldn’t say that would help haha .
 on apollo ,  you can enable on option that automatically hides posts you’ve seen .
 i have the option that when you click a button ,  it automatically hides all seen posts ,  and just at the press of a button which i find more reliable .
 no but i was very happy when apolllo released because it’s almost the same visually .
 you can actually turn it off in the app tho unlike sync
 let’s put this to the test .
 ah yes ,  how foolish of me .
 i think that i will .
 i found a few as well .
 thanks for helping .
 sorry to be a noob but could you please tell me what iftt means ?
 iftt is so useful .
 sorry u/teqqqie ,  another newb question .
 just downloaded iftt ,  how would i go about specifically setting up the automation woth pocket you just mentioned ?
 another reason why old reddit  new reddit
 i &apos;ve defaulted to old reddit for so long ,  i forgot new reddit was a thing .
 what’s the difference between new and old reddit ?
 i &apos;ll quit reddit if old ever goes away and there &apos;s no replacement via plug-in or userscript for it .
 everything you scrolled past ,  so you might back out of something then accidentally refresh and forget what you were even on ,  or be scrolling and miss something and refresh ,  it works for those limited circumstances
 are we still talking about a scrolling wall of self-contained reddit posts ?
  i mean ,  i &apos;m sure they &apos;re out there ,  but i &apos;m yet to encounter a long series of anything here .
  feels like a very niche use where you &apos;d probably get the same functionality simply by saving whatever post you were up to .
 thanks for relieving my fears .
 i was sorta hoping that would be the case ,  but you never know .
 all you do is watch the powerball drawing and then 45 minutes later you buy yourself the winning ticket .
 if i spent my time gaining money ,  i wouldn &apos;t have found reddit because i wouldn &apos;t have met the people who introduced me to this wonderful website
 chop chop have fun !
 i couldn’t imagine how this place would be with out you ,  sprog
 when i was little ,  i just couldn &apos;t wait !
 here i sit broken hearted .
 tried to shit but only farted .
 and still no place to complain .
 it &apos;s like we can &apos;t even comunicate with the developer(s) .
 it &apos;s not a bug ,  it &apos;s a feature !
 if devs are gods ,  then who &apos;s the ceo of this bullshit ?
 just to be sure .
 rick and morty thing sorry .
 if you’re curious it’s the vat episode
 it &apos;s been in the backlog since beta !
 no one wants to touch it cuz the code is written in ancient mayan .
 and the rumor has it ,  whoever deciphers it will have to support it for the rest of their life .
 your very welcome .
 on iftt ,  search  &apos;save reddit to pocket &apos; (if you &apos;re using the app ,  you search by clicking  &apos;get more &apos; or something like that) .
 there should be an applet with that exact name ,  created by devin .
 click on it ,  click connect ,  and follow any prompted steps (basically just logging in to reddit and pocket) .
 you &apos;ll probably have to create a pocket account ,  and once you do ,  you &apos;ll probably want to go to your pocket settings and turn off offline access or whatever it &apos;s called .
 otherwise ,  pocket will try to download a certain number of the items it saves .
 i think that &apos;s it !
 once you figure it out ,  connecting applets on iftt is super easy .
 making them ,  on the other hand ,  i have no idea about
 reddit enhancement suite .
 it &apos;s an add-on you can use on the old desktop site for bonus features .
 even on my phone it &apos;s old reddit for most things .
 if the app would allow landscape mode ,  it might be a different story .
 are there any reasons why new reddit  old reddit ?
 just the ui i guess
 the alligator eats the better thing !
 how would i know ?
 new to reddit anyway .
 unfortunately i &apos;ve accidentally tapped one of the two fucking ads that force you to new reddit a few times .
 i don &apos;t want to .
 i wish i could get ride of those ads .
 old reddit is ,  in my opinion ,  cleaner ,  and easier to navigate .
 i &apos;m just an old 30ry old stuck in my ways .
 i agree ,  there is literally no redeeming factor of new reddit
 i still think at some point your butler will be like “memes” and you will find redddit
 i use the reddit is fun app ,  it returns you to where you left off automatically when you return to the app .
 it sounds so much worse having to use the original app .
 only time i use the main app is to post videos .
 when i was approaching my ninth birthday i told my grandmother i wanted to skip this birthday and go right to ten because that &apos;s a whole decade and that &apos;s so cool .
 she sort of half-laughingly half-seriously told me not to wish my life away because it will go faster than i think ,  and i remember thinking  &apos;i dunno ,  it &apos;s been pretty slow so far &apos; .
 i &apos;m 23 now and oh boy is it speeding up
 back in class ,  i took the chance .
 tried to fart but shat my pants .
 they really are playing god .
 i &apos;m a ux designer .
 we should all write strongly worded emails and keep them in our drafts
 thanks so much for the explanation .
 that sounds awesome !
 done ,  thank you !
 i wished res was on reddit is fun .
 i would like to be able to organize my saved stuff .
 it &apos;s easily the superior reddit app .
 in your preferences you can select to use old reddit ,  and then never have to use old .
 (preferences top right - beta options at the bottom - untick  &apos;use new reddit as my default experience)
 there’s also a chrome extension that does it automatically
 and i did my best to give it a fair try .
 the editor on new reddit is nice ,  the old reddit editor is rather random .
 its looks like a phone app ,  and it better for the advertisers .
 that &apos;s literally it .
 the ui is much better imo .
 but there are a lot of features on old reddit that are not accessible in new reddit .
 i &apos;ve been on reddit since 2010 .
 i switched to new reddit a year ago .
 there &apos;s not much wrong with it ,  most people are just adverse to change .
 is generally a better experience ,  overall .
 that said ,  user profiles suck balls .
 why are comments displayed as nested conversations in the profile ?
 it &apos;s difficult to navigate .
 and it was a dick move to kill the r/redesign sub
 #all you do is watch the powerball drawing and then 45 minutes later you buy yourself the winning ticket .
 i even used to add 2 extra digits to my age and show off how old i am .
 now if i have a button that resets it all ,  i wouldn &apos;t even hesitate for a second and punch the damn thing !
 you think a year goes fast now ?
 wait until you &apos;re 40 ,  a year literally goes so fast .
 just uninstall it with a rope .
 for extra clarification ,  ifttt stands for  &apos;if this then that &apos; so you can do things like  &apos;if i say x to google home then it turns lights on and plays music &apos; or  &apos;if the who posts something about a disease outbreak then email me &apos; .
 it &apos;s a really cool website check it out .
 i &apos;ve never used any other reddit app besides rif and honestly never felt the need to switch .
 relay is also an excellent reddit viewer .
 do you guys have an alternative for the reddit app that &apos;s just like it but doesn &apos;t include pfps in the comments .
 i switched to boost just because of that but i &apos;m used to the reddit app interface .
 this is probably really specific and hard to find but i &apos;d just like the reddit app that was there a year ago .
 installed an old version of reddit .
 ah it feels good .
 good for others to see .
 that &apos;s why i said if you &apos;re not logged in .
 sometimes when i &apos;m just browsing it &apos;s faster than logging in to just type in  &apos;old .
 i memorized the old editor syntax so i refuse to switch to the new one and thus have my pointless effort be in vain
 the old reddit syntax isn’t exactly random ,  it is markdown ,  a legitimate language used in tons of applications .
 but yeah ,  for the average user ,  a word-processor type editor is definitely friendlier .
 markdown is a well-established syntax for digital writing and far from random
 on my phone it &apos;s an app .
 will that work ?
 what ,  so when you were six you told people you were 106 ?
 sorry to break it to you ,  but i don &apos;t think that would have been desperately convincing .
 the problem is you lose all your progress .
 you need to find rop gadgets tho
 i ised to use iftt years ago and totally forgot about it .
 thanks for reminding me !
 i even bought the premium version to support them ,  it &apos;s exactly the same as the normal one but still worth it .
 (disclaimer: i use google opinion rewards to get free credit and honestly struggle to find things to spend it on)
 the fact that you can block ads for free is enough reason alone
 how do you install the old version of reddit ?
 in your preferences you can select to use old reddit ,  and then never have to use old .
 (preferences top right - beta options at the bottom - untick  &apos;use new reddit as my default experience)
 that &apos;s also my biggest fear !
 that they will remove old reddit one day .
 perhaps that would give enough people reason to leave reddit and move to a new platform even .
 the new design looks so damn ugly and inefficient .
 no ,  if you &apos;re on an app then you get whatever the app shows .
 if you &apos;re on desktop or web-browser there &apos;s a difference between new and old reddit .
 i use baconreader on the phone so i don &apos;t know what else is out there for mobile reddit .
 no matter ,  you get to haunt people in the sequal game ghost watchers aka ghost rapists depending on how you play
 brushing my teeth
 welp it’s the 22nd in australia so i guess i missed it
 looking at the clock at 9:32 .
 well ,  now i &apos;ll have to watch the clock .
 so i guess that &apos;s what i &apos;ll be doing
 shouldn &apos;t we wait for the 21st month to do this ?
 probably forgetting about it
 whoever was born at 9:21 ,  21 years ago ,  is probably pretty stoked .
 shit ,  only 4 minutes to plan .
 its 22nd and 6 am  .
 i was playing pokemon btw .
 trying to sleep but instead staring at my ceiling having an existential crisis .
 isnt it the 9:21 during the 22nd hr ?
 21 savage has entered the chat 
 centuries are 1-indexed ,  times are 0-indexed .
 midnight is the 1st hour ,  1am is the 2nd hour ,  etc .
 i &apos;m posting this comment literally as the clock is turning to 9:21
 at that exact moment (which has passed for me ,  i’m in ireland) i was watching liverpool lose their home record to burnley .
 2021 is going to be fuckin shite .
 i read this at 9:22 
 discussing the misprinted calendars the school had purchased
 yeetin my schmeat while the rest of ya be watchin
 patiently wait another 21 seconds
 sorry i had to ,  the opportunity was right there
 if i’m being perfectly honest i think my dick was in my hand at 9:21
 \looks at time\ .
 the same thing we do every night ,  pinky .
 trying to take over the world !
 i hope someone somewhere is hitting a blackjack at a casino .
 isn’t 2021 the 22nd year of the 21st century ?
 i made the decision to not end my life ,  and to put down the bottle .
 wish me luck ,  friends ,  i &apos;ve been through this battle many times in my life ,  but i feel that this is the last one .
 having a cigar and a beer .
 well now i’m panicking for no reason because i found this at 9:20 exactly lol
 i found this post at exactly 9:22 .
 i feel like i just narrowly missed learning some deep ,  cosmic secrets to the universe or something .
 i will be grateful to be alive and well !
 i &apos;m a minute late ,  nooooo !
 i told my boyfriend and my dog i loved them though .
 the first minute of the first hour of a given day is 12:00 .
 being in a different timezone where its already the 22nd .
 amazingly ,  finding this post .
 the time will be 21:21 ,  but that &apos;s actually the 22nd hour and 22nd minute ,  as 00:00 is the first hour of the day and first minute of the hour .
 moral of the story: use 24h time .
 same thing we do every night ,  pinky .
 try to take over the world !
 found this at the perfect time !
 it &apos;s in 1 minute !
 i &apos;ll be staring at the clock and smiling !
 not giving a shit
 it’s the 22nd for me
 you have been waiting for this haven’t you ?
 watching critical role .
 very excited for more interactions with lucien .
 ah fuck ,  i missed it .
 hate to ruin your special moment ,  but the first hour of the 21st day began at midnight ,  making the 21st hour actually 8:00 pm ,  also the 21st minute was 8:20 .
 congrats to biden !
 having a shot of whiskey and smoking some hash .
 did it , no idea why i think it &apos;s so cool .
 i just bought a lottery ticket at the exact second !
  thanks for the reminder !
  why didn’t you tell me sooner !
 literally read this at 921
 9:21 is in the 22nd hour of that day 
 thanks for the tip .
 i’ll make sure to be masturbating .
 i was writing a message to my dad telling him how much i love him and i hope his birthday was good .
 he spent it alone at home and i can’t help but feel so guilty .
 everyone is in here arguing about the year ,  but the time is the thing that &apos;s wrong lol
 i thought this year is the 22nd year of 21st century 
 same thing i always do .
 hopefully getting off work .
 hello ,  post from 21 days ago .
 shut the fuck up no one cares
 no one cares about this bullshit
 you could literally post this every year just with different numbers ,  and some of the numbers in this post are wrong .
 how does shit like this get up votes .
 i actually really enjoyed this !
 i just realized a delivered a baby and watched the mom bond during the first minute of life at 21:21 today .
 i &apos;m a mom of a pre-schooler and i have a full-time paying job .
 i think i was crying around that time
 i was watching jeopardy !
 i missed this one
 i &apos;ll be getting tired of seeing this dumb shit
 what a retarded question
 can we fucking do seconds and milliseconds too .
 i &apos;m gonna cream .
 so it’s right now ,  and i’m watching giannis play lebron after finally getting my kid to bed .
 reading a post previous to stumbling across this one - juuuust missed it lol
 9:26 am in vietnam here .
 parent/teacher conferences at my international school .
 being paid to sit here and browse reddit because millionaires here generally don &apos;t give a fuck about their children &apos;s education .
 they will all get good jobs through nepotism and cronyism ,  no matter how shitty the kid is .
 i was browsing reddit and my husband was playing nba2k .
 just like most nights .
 working my 14th hour of the day .
 it &apos;s already 11am on the 22nd .
 i was just watching youtube videos .
 no jokes someone i know from europe posted this on fb .

 just saw this as it turned 9:21 mst .
 and looking at reddit .
 i opened reddit and this was on my home feed at exactly 9:21 .
 just checked the time when i saw this ,  and it was 9:21 .
 just passed to 22 as i type this .
 i have infinite luck for the year i now i guess .
 i didn &apos;t realize .
 i think i was probably just brushing my dogs &apos; teeth
 i kissed my girlfriend ,  and i &apos;m damn proud of it !
 fuck ,  missed it by 2 minutes
 missing it by about an hour apparently .
 reading this ,  bout 4 minutes late .
 oops ,  missed it .
 was doing homework .
 isn &apos;t it the 22nd year .
 being told by my friend who is definitely fun at parties that it &apos;s actually the 22nd year of the 21st century apparently
 reading this post 2 hours and 10 minutes late
 i guess i was reading one piece ,  nice .
 reading this post 3 hours too late .
 sounds like a good reason to get high .
 i was eating gluten free oreos for the first time and weeping with joy .
 21 is my new lucky number .
 playing minecraft with the boys
 i will be sitting here drankin’ and waiting for my girlfriend to come home .
 and i won’t remember this moment come next week
 nothing because time is a human construct
 sleep through it ,  apparently
 i’m gonna be either at safeway ,  at home ,  or almost home .
 i’ll very likely be at safeway though .
 hmmm maybe i &apos;ll sing 21 guns by green day for a full minute or something
 no one will see this .
 but i was drinking and being sad .
 same 21:21 as it has been every year the past few years .
 drinking cuz its my 21st birthday
 i will wait till next month for it to happen again ,  alarm set
 i was drinking whiskey .
 mostly because i have a cold ,  partially because i love whiskey .
 today is my and my gf’s 3rd year anniversary .
 i was on my first date !
 missing it by 3 hours
 in three minutes ?
 browsing on reddit
 getting hyped for it then missing it
 i saw this at 9:19 ,  so probably still scrolling through reddit
 it &apos;s 12:18am on the 22nd for me now so  .
 playing sims 4 .
 i’m watching my husband play wow while high as hell ,  so i’m vibin’
 woah i just saw this at 9:21 by chance
 literally read this at 9:21pm pst
 literally just opened reddit and saw this .
 apparently looking at this .
 i &apos;m reading this at 9:21
 it’s that time right now !
  i’m laying in bed with my dog sleeping with his head on my arm .
 reading this apparently .
 reading this post
 you know how to party .
 it is imperative that you carefully brush precisely 21 of your teeth .
 otherwise 21 tooth fairies will hunt you down in 21 weeks and pull them out ,  leaving you 21 dollar bills under 21 pillows scattered around 21 lowe &apos;s home improvement stores in 21 states in 21 countries .
 why don’t we just start posting this at least the day before ?
 give the post time to get its upvotes and include the whole world ?
 22nd in entire world except for the americas (the two continents) and probably few islands i don &apos;t know about too well
 whoops missed it ,  still annoyed at op for not using 24hr time though .
 good news: the 21st year of the 21st century is actually 2022 .
 this is what you get for not upvoting those memes that threaten you with bad luck .
 that &apos;s ok ,  next year is the 21st year of the 21st century as there was no year 0 between 1bc and 1ad
 yeah why &apos;s this getting posted when the time has already passed pretty much everywhere ?
 i read this at 9:32 .
 same ,  apparently i rang in this momentous occasion by texting a friend about bernie’s mittens .
 looked at the clock at 9:32 ,  read this at 9:32 .
 i literally read this post at 9:21 it was so weird haha
 i literally just opened the comments and read this at 9:32 .
 bro what the fuck
 i looked at exactly 9:33 .
 i didn &apos;t understand how this was possible until i remembered time zones were a thing .
 yeah ,  i’m also seeing this in the future .
 masturbating is apparently the answer to what i will be doing .
 i read this at 9:32 
 i also read this at 9:32 .
 just change the time on your clock to 21:21 now so you don’t have to wait .
  just realised i can do this with the date as well .
 can’t wait to relive this moment with my grandkids one day .
 they’ll be so excited .
  but i did have cat restraining me on the sofa  .
 so not much else i could really do
 shit ,  now we need more roman emperors to add months named after themselves to the calendar .
 lousy smarch weather .
 “at 9:21 tonight ,  it will be the 21st minute of the 21st hour of the 21st day of the 21st month of the 21st year of the 21st century .
 lousy smarch weather
 we can do it again in the 21st week
 my fooking dumbass was like  &apos;wait ,  he &apos;s right !
 did op post this pre-21st month to karmawhore ,  by sneakily removing 21st month ?
  &apos; until i realized 21st month doesn &apos;t exist lmfao
 i would but there is a good chance we will all be dead
 y &apos;all stuck in 12 month time ?
 upgrade to mil-spec 24 month time today !
 bamboozle your friends !
 add extra zeroes !
 it &apos;s the 01st month !
 also 21st week of the 21st month ,  it &apos;s only fair
 humble poor award for this bright comment .
 or twenty first week
 i &apos;m one of those people !
 sadly ,  the joy was kinda cockblocked by covid restrictions .
 the people born 21 years and 21 days ago are even more stoked
 i wonder how many people ,  if any ,  are in the world born at that exact time .
 yeah but covid made it so you can &apos;t go to the club so that sort of sucks .
 yooo that’s me i just celebrated my 21st birthday
 aside from the whole looming economic collapse and dying job market on the heels of mounting student loans that is .
 hell yeah brother .
 i didn &apos;t even find this post until it was after 9:21 because i was sleeping .
 its already mid afternoon on the 22nd here ,  i was probably doing housework .
 same ,  doing a nuzlocke run of soul silver
 for a second i thought you said wanking .
 i was concerned .
 with you there woo .
 i was either cleaning pee off a floor or injecting medications .
 i should have made it more memorable .
 you won’t be alone in your experience .
 they &apos;re a year and an hour late .
  i think what they were after was 21:21 ,  21/1/2021 ,  but kinda miscalculated .
 can’t believe how far i had to scroll down to see this .
 really expected it to be the top comment .
 on a 24 hour clock it would be 2121 .
 i wish people would get on board with using the 24 hour clock .
 it &apos;s a whole lot less confusing than using ante and post meridian .
 don &apos;t forget twenty one pilots
 emphasis on furiously !
 why did i have to scroll down and up so far to see this
 i &apos;m just about to get started .
 came here to say this and had to scroll down a long way to find someone who &apos;d already made the point .
 thank you for your service .
 years are 0 indexed too .
 this post missed it by a whole year .
 i feel like i heard your accent through my phone and i love it .
 i read this in a drunken pirate accent
 it was four minutes ago for me and i was indeed jerking off .
 this was the first post i saw after i cleared my history .
 sorry ,  i had to ,  the opportunity was right there .
 i legit had to read this 4 times before realising the edit wasn &apos;t broken english and just poor punctuation .
 scrolled too far down to see this .
 never mind ,  2021 is indeed the 21st year .
 but 9:21 is not the 21st minute
 good luck internet friend !
  i &apos;m rooting for you !
 this is the first day of the rest of your life and you got this !
 good on you for fighting !
 keep trying ,  don’t be afraid to ask for help if you are able to .
 i’m so glad you decided to keep going .
 you are a strong person .
 west coast here ,  i &apos;ve still got some time .
 so i hope you &apos;re right .
 amen that we &apos;re alive and healthy .
 the century started in 2001 .
 anyone who actually gets excited about it being a certain numerically pleasing date or palindrome or anything of that ilk is a fucking sad person who needs to get out more .
 i saw this ,  friend .
  if you wanna talk about anything ,  please let me know .
 and don &apos;t feel held back just cuz you &apos;re drunk ,  i &apos;m getting drunk tonight as well ,  so we can be belligerent together if you like :d
 i &apos;m reading this for the first time on the 23rd .
 might need to be a couple days early .
 shh ,  they don &apos;t know there are other nations ,  time zones and realities out there .
 just wait untill next time
 yes those  &apos;9:21 nights &apos; that occur mid morning throw me off as well .
 bad news: it isn &apos;t .
 upvoted for the  &apos;i &apos;m an idiot &apos; edit .
 actually op &apos;s right because the first year of the 21st century was 2001 .
 most people celebrated the new century in 2000 ,  but since the first century began as 1 ad ,  not 0 ad ,  this means the 21st century in reality began in 2001 and so the 21st year in this century is 2021 .
 assumed u made the common mistake of saying 2000 was the start of the century ,  but your statement would actually mean 2002 is the start which i must say i haven &apos;t seen before haha
 classic off-by-one error
 the century starts at 2001 not 2000 .
 is 2001 not part of the 21st century ?
 time zones are a hell of a thing .
 crazy world we live in .
 reading this at 9:34 here
 i just read this at 9:32 .
 seriously just read this ,  just now at 9:32 
 and i read this at 9:32
 i can send a photograph
 i’d say that’s pretty appropriate for the time
 my country &apos;s national news channel .
 (which is proud for always being present at all important events ,  national and international .
 there is some kind of event at that exact time .
 9:32 checking in lmao
 sorry for hijacking ,  but it &apos;s actually the 22nd year of the 21st century .
 should have done this last year .
 i wish i was fortunate enough to have done that .
 just happened in my time zone !
 damn and we all thought time travel was impossible .
 fuck you ,  shorsey .
 ysk: you can change the date on your computer to the future .
 any files you create will be marked with that date .
 this man is a genius
 give yer balls a tug titfucker
 the real life pro tip is always in the comments .
 try next year on the 22nd at 10:22pm .
 bahahaha i was about to copy the title and post it on my wechat to see what everyone will be doing tonight .
  saw your comment ,   laughed at you .
 then checked the date .
 damn it i missed it too bahahaha
 don’t be afraid to perform a scimitar slice on your car if it postures you on you
 i vote we make the 13th month incitatus in honor to the serene caligula .
 i mean as far as i &apos;m concerned we &apos;re in the 13th month of 2020 .
 no roman emperor ever added a month named after themselves .
 a roman emperor king added two months ,  and different roman emperors changed the names of existing months to be named after themselves .
 but no one did both .
 the extra months that make the -ember months out by two are january and february .
 not july and august .
 do not touch willie .
 as far as i &apos;m concerned we &apos;re still in smarch of 2020 .
 this was farther down than i expected .
 could do 21st month of the 21st century .
 wait that was a while ago nevermind
 oh hey same birthday ,  you &apos;re like 2hrs older than me !
 heyy me too happy birthday 21 21 twin
 lol i feel that covid cock block singing happy birthday by my family holding phones up of facetime calls from other family members as they all sing happy birthday different but enjoyed it
 not really cuz it wouldn &apos;t be their b-day
 cheers from my dreams
 just out of curiosity ,  what does your name say in english ?
 i feel for you guys .
 my eyes were burning so i had to stop .
 who says they can’t do both
 seriously ,  get out of my room .
 here we are alone together .
 still just as lonely and isolated ,  but together nonetheless .
 the first minute of the hour is 8:00 .
 i wonder how many people were doing the same thing at both times .
 that &apos;s a bit complicated .
 the gregorian calender doesn &apos;t have a year 0 ,  so the in that calender the start of a new millennium is in the year x001 .
 but the astronomical calendar does have a year 0 ,  so a millennium starts at year x000 .
 basically the question here depends on if you say  &apos;in the year 100 bc &apos; or  &apos;in the year -100 &apos; .
 basically the basically is that 0 vs 1 indexing is a bitch .
 that doesn &apos;t really address his point though .
 the 21st hour in a day is 8pm - 8:59pm (fully including that last minute ,  ending the moment before 9pm) .
 you can figure this out yourself if you start from the beginning .
 what &apos;s the 1st hour of the day ?
 so the second hour starts at 1 ,  the third hour starts at 2 ,  and so on .
 yes and the first minute of the day is 00:00 which is also in the first hour even though there are no 1 &apos;s in that time .
 01:01 is the second minute of the second hour .
 02:02 is the third minute of the third hour .
 making 21:21 the 22nd minute of the 22nd hour .
 welp don &apos;t wanna feel left out unzips
 this made it way funnier ,  thank you
 idk why you got downvoted .
 got a chuckle out of me
 i guess you could say .
 except it &apos;s not .
 the century started in 2001 .
 so wouldn &apos;t it be this time next year ?
 i see you’re a fan of espolon reposado .
 that’s the best tequila in my opinion .
 don &apos;t forget to floss !
 just wait a century for the 22nd
 hey man ,  it’s not the american’s fault that no one else in the world thought about posting this while it was still the 21st for them .
 of course we know about those ,  the kardashians right ?
 no no ,  we know ,  we just don &apos;t give a damn because we think we &apos;re special lmao
 ikr he didn &apos;t even bother to say 9:21 pm or anything
 i know i am reading this at 8:04 am on the 22 i’m so sad
 funny thing is op made a different mistake though- the 12 am hour is the first hour of the day ,  so 8 pm is the 21st .
  similarly ,  8:00 is the first minute of the 8 pm hour ,  so 8:20 is the 21st minute .
 ah yes ,  thank you for reminding me of the start of 2020 where my biggest issue was getting annoyed at people constantly making this remark .
 those were the days
 there is no 0 a .
 for that matter) .
 would be the 1st century ,  101-200 would be the 2nd century ,  and so on .
 when you take a private plane from australia and like fly the world around from the begin of the day and keep flying  ,  you could fuel up in the air .
 could that mean that you live that day twice and next day not .
 timezones are interesting .
 damn bro ,  i just read this at 1:39 .
 a message from january 22nd .
  &apos;the past is a journal of faults and mistakes -   .
 of hopes and of visions that turned into fakes -   .
 of wishes and dreams that were sold for a fee -   .
 of things that were never ,    .
  &apos;the past is a mountain of blunders and slips -   .
 a fountain of faults and of missteps and trips -   .
 the future ,  however ,  &apos; he stopped to exclaim -   .
 the future ,  past people ,  is largely the same .
 it’s the simulation
 actually ,  it is the 21st year of the 21st century .
 there was no year 0 ,  so the 1st century started at year 1 ,  and the 21st century started at year 2001 .
 however ,  9:21 is during the 22nd hour of this day though .
 should have done this at 8:21 .
 i came here to say this .
 how &apos;s the future ?
 going forward in time is really easy .
 someone is about to get r/whooshed on reddit
 every time you remember something you are doing imaginary time travel .
 a memory is but a moment saved from the past by time travelling in to the future .
 fuck you psychowitz !
 tell your mom to knit me some bernie sanders mittens ,  my hands are freezing from washing all my cum off her face last night ,  i had to use cold water because hot water makes the proteins coagulate and the maid only cleaned the shower tuesday .
 it won &apos;t be the 22nd century next year
 in a hundred years
 isn &apos;t the 13th month already smarch ?
 i mean he was a consul .
 and the 14th month in honor of bigus dickus .
 lousy smarch weather .
 14th could be aries .
 no byzantium has been sat on for far too long .
 the thirteenth month will be named after justinian ,  huzzah !
 im afraid we &apos;re going to be groundhogs-daying this shit for the entire decade .
 2020 isn &apos;t just a year
 pretty sure we &apos;re just rolling back the clock to march of 2020 .
 got our first presidential plan to address this brand new pandemic today .
 interestingly none of the emperors who renamed months after themselves had the change stick .
 the two names that remain in use today ,  july and august ,  were named posthumously and not by julius caesar or augustus themselves .
 happy birthday mate !
 hope you had a good day :)
 happy birthday to you too ,  strange times to be celebrating a birthday .
 hey me three ,  happy birthday ,  birthday triplet
 thank you kind person :)
 rip to the mans .
 it & type weren &apos;t available so i had to make a different account with a worse name and then this one when morse code occured to me
 impossible ,  he &apos;s lying !
 there’s not enough ram for everything to be chrome
 i &apos;m gonna tell mum
 and isn’t this the 22nd year of the century ?
 the first being the year 2000 .
 ikr ,  op probably meant the 21:21 thing
 i &apos;m gonna edit .
 oh shit ,  yeah hahaha .
 you saw that post ,  i imagine .
  matter of fact ,  that was my wife chasing tequila with applesauce .
  i couldn &apos;t quite get behind it myself lol .
 regardless ,  i am indeed drinking espolon right now .
  it is ,  most certainly ,  the best $20 tequila i &apos;ve ever had !
 as long as you are using dental floss to floss .
 isnt 2021 the 22nd year of the century ?
 time for cryostasis i guess
 i’m sorry but what do you think he meant when he said “9:21 tonight” like it’s fairly obvious he meant pm
 yea but this is still the first year of the 203rd decade ad .
 and besides ,  today is the first day of the decade that ends in ten years’ time .
 didn &apos;t we lose some months or years along the way with calendar changes ?
 yet we are born at 0 and do not begin counting age years until we &apos;ve lived 1 .
 the confusion is in the language .
 if we refer to our age as which year we are living ,  the day of our birth and 364 days that follow would be our first year ,  but we &apos;re not 1 year old until the day we begin our second year of life .
 i recall a story of a navy ship in the pacific with a crewmember who was being a complete jerk .
 when confronted ,  he commented  &apos;heh ,  whatcha gonna do ,  take away my birthday ?
 so the captain ,  on the night just before his birthday ,  sailed right along the international date line ,  and crossed it at midnight .
 not exactly the same but i flew back from nz on 1/1/20 ,  then when landed at lax it was the night of 12/31/19 .
 so i basically time traveled back a year
 i remember flying back from japan ,  over northern russia/siberia to get back to the uk ,  and i witnessed i think 3 ,  might have been 2 though ,  sun rises and sun sets .
  just up and down every few hours .
 always weird flying against the spin of the earth .
 also ,  flying over the snowy mountains and open tundras of russia is somewhat terrifying ,  while beautiful .
 in a sort of  &apos;even if i survived a crash (i won &apos;t) ,  i &apos;d almost certainly die out there &apos; .
 you wouldn’t physically live for longer ,  you’d just live through and experience that round of the earth turning twice .
 and if you always keep flying ,  forever ,  you travel back in time ?
 if you fly faster than the earth rotates ?
 timezones are made up so no
 damn i &apos;m reading this at 9pm on 22nd january tf
 welp ,  freshest sprog i &apos;ve ever come across .
 since i never see it asked ,  do you have a collection or something professionally or somewhere other than reddit ?
 it &apos;d be nice to see .
 looks like sprog &apos;s back on the menu ,  boys !
 actually the 21st minute of the 21st hour started at 8:20 .
 by 8:21 it became the 22nd minute .
 this is the correct take
 it &apos;d be more accurate to say it &apos;ll be 21:21 instead .
 i mean yeah cus its january 22 here right now still living in the past people
 it &apos;s awfully slow though .
 what do you mean going forward in time is easy ?
 you can &apos;t do that !
 fuck you ,  shorsey !
 try again next century ?
 lousy smarch weather .
 dr seuss says the 13 month is octember .
 and he &apos;s  doctor .
 i don &apos;t know the opinion of his esteemed colleague ,  dr .
 you &apos;re thinking junetober .
 truly an inspiring politician .
 augustus was also a  &apos;consul &apos;
  what is so funny about the name .
 is it possible to hate a comment ,  while simultaneously loving it ?
 not sure if it exactly works ,  but i feel like this is r/tihi material .
 if it helps ,  nearly everyone on the planet has experienced it at this point !
 it &apos;s perfectly normal to celebrate your birthday on your birthday !
 you are very welcome !
 nope i am not i was playing the cards game physically
 no ,  there is no year 0 .
 in your case the first century &apos;d be 99 years long .
 so the 21st century started in 2001 .
 ok as people don &apos;t seem to understand: a century is 100 years .
 we started in year 1 .
 first century is from 1-100 .
 second century is from 101-200 .
 i’ve never tried it but i guess i could see how that might be good ?
 i’d have to be drunk to want to try it though lol .
 and nice i’m drinking some great local beer tonight
 yeah ,  fuck those little plastic flossers .
 such a waste of plastic .
 water flossers are next level .
 you tend to get used to the burns after the third role .
 the first century began on year one .
 therefore ,  the second century began on year 11 .
 we did skip some days because earlier ,  bissextile years weren &apos;t as accurate as now .
 but it didn &apos;t mess up the calendar ,  it was made especially to balance it .
 so it doesn &apos;t change anything except that some days didn &apos;t exist and years before were a bit shorter .
 i &apos;ve always been stumped by that birthday question !
  now to get me a boat .
 should have stayed in 2019 mate .
 with a 20/20 hindsight ,  i can confirm 2020 was not an ok year .
 you must have gotten up to 88mph for the flux capacitor to work right
 1970 superman would disagree about the time travel .
 51 in the am checking in
 i mean cake day !
 sprog wrote a book !
 poems for your sprog by sam garland and the mouse in the manor house by sam garland .
 hey you could be the guy who builds the tool that archives and compiles the collection .
 i would totally be 100% grateful
 i looked at a couple old posts ,  and he has at least one book called the mouse in the manor house (and other poems) .
 not sure if there &apos;s anything else out there though .
 he’s got a couple of books available on amazon !
 i believe i saw somewhere he has a book .
 might be mistaken though .
 exactly my thoughts !
 how the great have fallen .
 man ,  you &apos;re useless .
 yeah dont worry we all have forgotten the  &apos;+c &apos; at some point
 do not touch willie ,  good advice !
 say what you will ,  not a single roman was harmed by his policies .
 who else can make that claim ?
 impossible people just collect those cards because they look cool
 yes ,  you &apos;re correct technically ,  but the world popularly celebrated the new century when the calendar changed from 1999 to 2000 .
 using that point ,  2021 is the 22nd year of this century .
 why don &apos;t they just make it the version where we can change it &apos;s floss only ?
 damn it plastic flosser producters .
 i mean ,  he &apos;s technically not wrong ,  he &apos;s just oversimplifying it .
 if we wouldn &apos;t have made up timezones that &apos;d just mean sunrise in london would be at 6:30 and in new york at 13:30 ( just guessed ,  not factually correct times\\ ) .
 just like the northern hemisphere has winter in december-february and the southern hemisphere in june-august (approximations again for the sake of simplicity)
 1:55 here morning to you sir
 pretty sure you can find most of them here
 hope they’re teaching ordinals !
 nah ,  there &apos;s an easier way to do it and if there &apos;s an easier way to do it ,  we &apos;re talking about time travel here ,  that means it &apos;s already been done so i &apos;m just going to wait until i come find me from the future .
 there was once a wise man that said  &apos; .
 don &apos;t chase your dreams ,  ask them where they &apos;re going and meet up with them later .
  &apos; i &apos;ve adopted that philosophy on the matter .
 dogs go at 7 seconds per second .
 no need for formalities .
 my friends call me  &apos;forever &apos; .
 sobs because she has no friends
 i would not like to be touched
 saw the title of the post ,  came here looking for this exact bit .
 enjoy your upvotes
 civilizations who never interacted with rome
 so i just do it with 22 .
 that doesn &apos;t change the fact though ,  just because a lot of people were wrong doesn &apos;t change the truth .
 technically correct is the best kind of correct .
 though it is the least popular as well .
 actually there is exactly something like this .
 i can &apos;t find it right now but i saw a post on reddit once where there was even an electric one who straighten and cut the floss for you aswell ,  but a simple plastic one where you attach the floss yourself will also do .
 there is even biodegradable floss if you want to go an extra step with this .
 morning to you too at this fine 12:03
 damn alright well that was anticlimactic
 i like the cut of your giblets
 months and centuries are man-made (in the sense that a year and a day are based on actual events ,  but those are arbitrary) .
 so if we &apos;ve been (incorrectly) celebrating centuries as xx99 turns to yy00 for most of them ,  then maybe thats the way to go .
 but if you go that way ,  then 2021 = 21st year of century is wrong .
 if you celebrated the new century between 2000 and 2001 ,  then 2021 = 21st year is correct .
 2:10am as i keep the sleep away
 also ,  sprog app for android is pretty awesome .
 the end of the 20th century seems to be the only one where popular concensus placed it on the 00 year ,  not the 01 year .
 well that &apos;s neat .
 didn &apos;t know about this one ,  thanks
 when i was 5 my mom read me george’s secret key to the universe ,  that book shaped my earliest years ,  making me obsessed with being as smart as stephen hawking .
 hawking ,  and i’m so sorry lucy hawking for your loss .
 he has been one of the world &apos;s most iconic people for my entire life .
 i cannot recall a time when i didn &apos;t know who he was .
 we just lost a legend .
 for those who don &apos;t know ,  he was diagnosed with als when he was 21 years old in 1963 .
 at the time he was given a life expectancy of 2 years .
 the man had some serious fight in him
 a quote from him that i think many of you would enjoy:  .
  &apos;people who boast about their iq are losers .
 my aunt was diagnosed with als 18 months ago .
 10 months ago she was driving and now she has a feeding tube .
 this disease terrifies me and i am so afraid for her .
 i am so grateful for all the attention stephen hawking brought towards als .
 and his cameo on the simpsons .
 bloody good effort to make it to 76 with that illness .
 thank you for all your contributions to our world ,  stephen .
 rest in peace ,  mate .
 we just lost one of the greatest scientific minds of our time .
 but at least we had him for the time that we did ,  against all odds .
 it &apos;s kinda surreal reading this ,  feel weird right now .
  &apos;although i cannot move ,  in my mind i am free .
  &apos; -stephen hawking .
 this is a really random quote that stuck with me forever .
 i don &apos;t have any disease like him ,  but i still feel trapped and stuck by this body ,  by a system ,  by relationships ,  by responsibilities .
 so the only way i could escape that is in my mind through writing and creating stories .
 in my mind ,  i can do and be and exist however i want .
 rest in peace ,  great mind of the century .
 after seeing a trailer for the theory of everything ,  my wife was surprised to find out he had als .
 wife: if he is paralyzed how does he write all those books ?
 me: there &apos;s not too many ,  but i am sure it takes an extremely long time and .
 me: you know stephen hawking and stephen king are two different people right ?
 stephen hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of galileo &apos;s death (january 8th ,  1942) ,  and passed away on albert einstein &apos;s birthdate (march 14th) .
 i can &apos;t even begin to describe how cool that is
 this totally caught me off guard .
 i actually thought it was fake .
 he gave it a good go though .
 expected to die young ,  lives longer than most .
 fantastic though that he stuck with us this long .
 he may not have believed in life after death ,  but in the words of ernest hemingway ,   &apos;every man has two deaths ,  when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name .
 in some ways men can be immortal .
 live long stephen hawking ,  live long .
 they gave you 2 years in 1963 .
 god may not play dice with the universe ,  but you beat the odds anyway .
 rest in peace professor .
 hail to the greatest min-maxer of our time !
 despite rolling close to a 0 for constitution ,  his intelligence score actually gave him a bonus that allowed him to live far longer than even people with average scores .
 your accomplishments will echo far beyond the time we got to share with you .
 rest in peace ,  professor hawking
 rest in peace ,  stephen hawking .
 you’re back amongst the stars you loved .
 stephen hawking has always been one of the biggest reasons why i &apos;ve pursued physics and quantum mechanics .
 he has served as a reminder that i should never give up on my love of science .
 i am truly saddened and shocked to hear of his death .
 we &apos;ll see you on the other side ,  stephen .
 rest in peace buddy .
 one ,  remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet .
 two ,  never give up work .
 work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it .
 three ,  if you are lucky enough to find love ,  remember it is there and don &apos;t throw it away
 i hope he is revered and remembered in the future as much as einstein ,  newton ,  and the other greats .
 he will be sorely missed .
 such a great sense of humor .
 the only guest to have appeared on star trek as himself .
 what an amazing man .
 given 2 years to live and makes it to 2018 .
 we were lucky to have him around as long as we did .
 we just lost a once in a generation mind .
 i’m not afraid of death ,  but i’m in no hurry to die .
 i have so much i want to do first .
 a brief history of time rocketed hawking to stardom .
 published for the first time in 1988 ,  the title made the guinness book of records after it stayed on the sunday times bestsellers list for an unprecedented 237 weeks .
 his life was played out in biographies and documentaries ,  most recently the theory of everything ,  in which eddie redmayne played him .
 “at times i thought he was me , ” hawking said on watching the film .
 brb gotta watch the movie and feel numb .
 the world has lost a shining star .
  &apos;i believe the simplest explanation is ,  there is no god .
 no one created the universe and no one directs our fate .
 this leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either .
 we have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that ,  i am extremely grateful .
 - stephen hawking .
 man ,  my jaw actually dropped while reading this .
 the man’s put through a lot .
 i’m glad that he didn’t just pass away ,  but he passed leaving people inspired and filled with knowledge .
 “intelligence is the ability to adapt to change .
 couldn’t agree more .
 i got into physics because a brief history of time .
  i &apos;m going to graduate this year in aerospace engineering partly because of his book .
  &apos;i have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined ,  and that we can do nothing to change it ,  look before they cross the road .
 -rip stephen hawking - he &apos;s crossed thousands of scientific roads without looking at all
 doctors gave him 2 years ,  but his legacy will last for decades .
 he made the most of his life ,  what an incredible man .
 i wish i could &apos;ve met him once in my life ,  discuss with him around a dinner .
 and he died on 3 .
 who is going to be the next generation &apos;s iconic genius ?
 a great loss to mankind .
 man what a drag .
 wasn &apos;t expecting to see this before bed .
 it &apos;s incredible to think that someone with that condition could make it that long .
 we should feel lucky that we got to see his contribution for as long as we did 
 even though i haven’t read any of his research or his work ,  i know that he has made a tremendous impact on society and other people .
 rip and thank you for everything you’ve done for our world professor .
 diagnosed with als in his 20 &apos;s doctors gave him 5 years to live tops .
 he managed to make it all the way to 76 .
 on the way he proved that black holes actually emit a form of radiation contrary to the previously held believe that they are inescapable for all forms of matter; and inspired an entire generation of young scientists .
 hawking is a model that not just scientists but all people everywhere alike should strive to be like .
 when i was growing up ,  we would call smart people einstein .
 no doubt hawking will become the einstein of younger generations ,  and his legacy remembered forever .
 rip hawking ,  thank you for everything .
 it is uncommon for a single human to effect as many people &apos;s lives as stephen hawking has .
 this is devastating to all .
 may such a magnificent man rest in piece .
 i did not realize he was 76 ,  already .
 he just seemed that he would continue on ,  hed already beaten every odd of living .
 why not 80 ,  why not 90 even .
 76 is freaking amazing though ,  unbelievable
 he had 2 years to live and nearly made it 50 .
 insanely great reminder to treat every day like it matters .
 hope his contributions inspire a better generation .
 i just can’t believe he’s dead absolutely insane to me .
 a guy i’ve known about almost my entire life .
 i think this is the first death that’s hit me this hard .
 rip stephen hawking by far one of the smartest people to ever live .
 we &apos;ve lost another brilliant mind ,    .
 a bittersweet goodbye ,    .
 now steve can leave his chair behind ,    .
 the hawk is in the sky .
 at first i thought this was parody .
 it &apos;ll be weird to not have him in society 
 it &apos;s a terrible day for rain .
 we still needed him .
  &apos;the greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance ,  it is the illusion of knowledge .
 i hope he gets to see the universe .
 feels surreal right now .
  &apos;we are all now connected by the internet ,  like neurons in a giant brain .
  &apos; - stephen hawking ,  scientist and redditor .
 the fuck do you say to this ?
 arguably the smartest person is human history is dead .
 is this how people felt when einstein died ?
 rest in peace ,  stephen hawking
 what a fuckin &apos; dude .
 guy lived a life way beyond what anyone could have possibly expected of him .
 took the cards he was dealt and went  &apos;well that &apos;s just not fuckin &apos; good enough &apos; .
 this might be the saddest celebrity death of my life so far .
 what an amazing man and human being .
 one of the greatest losses of the generation .
 rest in peace ,  mr .
 i just went to a concert tonight ,  and one of the showstopping numbers includes a quote from richard dawkins that i always find very moving .
 when i came home and found out stephen hawking had passed ,  i was reminded of the quote that so often makes me stop and think .
 if anyone embodies the sentiment ,  he does .
  &apos;after sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet ,  sparkling with color ,  bountiful with life .
 within decades we must close our eyes again .
 isn &apos;t it a noble ,  an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun ,  to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it ?
 i appreciate him and all he did but .
 why is this on askreddit ?
 he was born exactly 300 years after the death of galileo ,  and died on pi day .
 that &apos;s enough coincidences that i bet that someone just as brilliant as him ,  or maybe moreso ,  was born today .
 or at least i &apos;d like to hope .
 it &apos;s a dark day for science .
 rest in piece dr .
 rest well stephen .
 one man with lives for 55 years with als while the rest of the worlds medical professionals struggle to keep patients alive for more than 3 .
 what did stephen teach his doctor ?
 i looked at this and thought ,   &apos;this can &apos;t be real &apos; .
 then i looked him up and it is all over the news .
 i mean ,  this just proves that time flies by .
 one day ,  he &apos;s teaching people about the multiverse theory and then the next ,  poof !
 man ,  may he rest in peice .
 why is this on askreddit
 does this mean the world is ending ?
 why is this on /r/askreddit ?
 and what is the question ?
 why is this posted in r/askreddit ?
 what is the question ?
 rip one of the greatest minds to ever lived .
 thank you for everything stephen .
 i shouldn &apos;t be as surprised as i am .
 probably the closest thing most of us still living will ever see to an einstein .
 oh my god ,  i remember reading that book when i was really young ,  but i completely forgot its name and i &apos;ve wanted to know ever since .
 thank you for reminding me .
 i don &apos;t remember what was in the book exactly ,  but it was definitely something that really opened my eyes .
 that book was freaking awesome !
 it also got me inspired to learn about that ,  never figured the book out though .
 i didn &apos;t even know this book existed but i looked it up after reading your comment and i just bought it for my brother .
 he is fresh out of high school going to college for a major in astrophysics and he got really sad when he heard the news of hawkings passing :( 
 that book is so freaking awesome .
 it made me go after learning what were some pretty advanced physics concepts for a kid
 he was science &apos;s face ,  essentially .
 pretty amazing considering his disability .
 my favorite quote of his is this:  .
  &apos;speech has allowed the communication of ideas ,  enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible .
 mankind &apos;s greatest achievements have come about by talking .
 our greatest hopes could become reality in the future ,  with the technology at our disposal ,  the possibilities are unbounded .
 all we need to do is make sure we keep talking &apos; .
 pink floyd actually used that in a song iirc
 i &apos;m a bit overwhelmed .
 it feels really bizarre to know he &apos;s gone .
 he will certainly be missed
 from the man himself: .
 “my expectations were reduced to zero when i was 21 .
 everything since then has been a bonus .
 i have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years .
 i &apos;m not afraid of death ,  but i &apos;m in no hurry to die .
 i have so much i want to do first .
 yes but what they didnt know was that he had a really slow spreading als type which allowed him to live this extrodinary life
 i watched a relative die to als personally .
 i experienced it secondhand as he lost his ability to move until eventually he could only move his head .
 i have to say ,  it is truly amazing that this man was able to live so long with this terrible condition and accomplish what he did .
 my relative died in front of me at a young age shortly after being diagnosed .
 the idea that someone could survive for 50 years with als blows my mind
 most healthy people don &apos;t even live as long as he did .
 and then went on to leave an enormous body of advanced scientific work and three children .
 we lost a legend today .
 watching this man go through such a struggle just to share his valuable thoughts with the world was so incredibly inspiring .
 the overwhelming majority of people would hide themselves from the world given these circumstances but he refused to let it affect his life .
 truly amazing man right here
  &apos;i have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined ,  and that we can do nothing to change it ,  look before they cross the road .
 i never even considered him as being prone to death despite als and his age .
 in my mind he was an immortal super hero .
 his death is a cruel reality check for the science community .
 may he live on through his invaluable contribution to our world .
 i have an iq of 300 and even then ,  i still wouldn &apos;t dare boast about it .
 yeah ,  those tests are bogus .
 i got a full 100 in my iq test and i don &apos;t feel any smarter than anyone else .
 tell this to the recent trend of  &apos;iq level of  &apos;n &apos;  &apos; posts over at /r/overwatch
 i feel for you man .
 a good friend of mine lost his mother to als when he was in grade 10 .
 she was diagnosed for 3 years iirc .
 it was incredibly tough for him ,  as well as our friend group .
 my fiance &apos;s cousin was diagnosed with als last year .
 he went from perfectly normal to having difficult speaking and barely being able to walk on his own within just a few months .
 he left his wife knowing it &apos;d be easier for her and the kids if they only visited on occasion .
 i don &apos;t think he will make our wedding this summer .
 incredibly sad to see how quickly it takes over .
 doing my masters dissertation around assistive technology for people with motor neurone disease (als) was one of the most depressing points in my life .
 having to live through that illness would have completely crushed my spirit .
 the fact he survived so long with it is a testament to how determined he was to make the world a better place .
 i like the family guy one .
  &apos;i &apos;m telling you this shtick is getting so old ,  that chair smells dude &apos; .
  &apos;hey steve surfs up &apos; .
  &apos;alrightttt seeya bitch &apos; .
 in all seriousness ,  he is a immortalized legend rip .
 and lets not forget his cameos on the big bang theory too :)
  &apos;we have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that ,  i am extremely grateful .
 it is without a doubt in my mind that his accomplishments and spirit will echo throughout eternity .
 all the best of life is fleeting ,    .
 what a joy it was to find you .
 what a life you leave behind you .
 he died on pi day .
 there &apos;s a sort of sad but ironic beauty to that .
 he had a good life for someone diagnosed to only live 2 more years in 1962
 76 is what i &apos;m hoping to hit and i don &apos;t have any sort of illness that i know of .
 hawking inspired generations .
 he will be sorely missed .
 i only hope that we have some young scientists ,  from any nation ,  willing to take on that mission .
 we desperately need inspiration from those big thinkers .
 musk is in that group but we need more .
 ever more ,  forever more .
 let us find them or make them .
 yeah ,  it &apos;s strange .
 despite his illness ,  it never crossed my mind that he &apos;d die at some point soon .
 that &apos;s almost word for word what i said to my husband .
 i &apos;m utterly speechless .
 it &apos;s almost as if i expected him to be around forever or something .
 i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m feeling .
 i’m not even in a science field ,  nor do i know much of anything about science ,  and it felt surreal to read those words .
 rip to a great man with an incredible mind .
 what he did to advance humanity’s understanding of the universe is completely irreplaceable .
 i haven &apos;t really cared for many celebrity deaths over the past few years but this feels weird .
 i &apos;m not even very scientifically inclined ,  but i still feel upset to hear this .
 it &apos;s just not something that one generally thinks about .
 at least it &apos;s not something i ever thought about .
 he just seemed so eternal .
 i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever get used to referencing him as now deceased .
 yeah ,  i never thought that he would die this soon :( we have lost one of the greatest people to ever live ,  rest in peace stephen .
 as sick he was ,  it never once crossed my mind that he &apos;d actually die .
 as long as i &apos;ve been alive he was top science man .
 having an intellectual power vacuum at the top feels strange .
 i imagine people felt this way when einstein died .
 shit lately has been crazy enough ,  but this on top of it all .
 no matter your stance on other things ,  hawking was one of the best kind of people the world can hope for .
 i &apos;m saving your comment because now i can &apos;t stop thinking about what this quote means to me too .
 i thankfully don &apos;t have als ,  but i do have a physical condition that limits my mobility and makes me ill a lot .
 it affects every aspect of my life ,  and some days it gets hard .
 stephen hawking &apos;s life is a reminder that you can still contribute even if you need extra help .
 and that no one gets to decide if your life is fulfilling except you .
 this quote is really powerful .
 i think he knew how to take control of something many of us never learn to use fully .
 the mind and imagination have more potential than we often give them credit for .
 thank you for inspiring me and so many people .
 i &apos;ll do my best to remember this wisdom forever .
 i forget which mini documentary series it was that used this quote ,  but it always gave me shivers as benedict cumberbatch &apos;s voice over took over the last few words .
 i &apos;m the opposite ,  i &apos;m fit ,  i look pretty good ,  but i suffer from anxiety and depression ,  have doubts about every action i make and it controls my social life ,  i need to learn from hawking
 when i was trapped at home ,  not allowed to leave by my mother ,  i would spend hours looking at maps ,  pretending to be planning long journeys .
 then i started writing ,  living vicariously through my characters .
 people like him ,  people with disabilities that managed to be great and loved and important ,  they inspired me to sneak out to do mundane things like sit in a park for a few minutes .
 if someone who can &apos;t walk can make discoveries and advance science ,  then someone who can &apos;t drive (me) can make friends and be productive too .
 never ever ever ever let her live that down 
 my grandma actually confused stephen hawking with anthony hopkins .
 your wife sounds hot
 throw stephen fry into the mix .
 wait ,  did a famous scientist get born today though ?
 both lived to 76 ,  with galileo being the exception at 77 .
 which also happens to be pi (3 .
 so 2 exceptional physicists have direct relations to pi day .
 we did full circle .
 would be seriously interesting to keep track of all the babies born near his time of death ,  i &apos;m sure someone out there is .
 he could have died on pretty much any day and a famous person would have either een born or have died on that date .
 yeah ,  i saw it on twitter and thought it was fake .
 then saw it again on twitter from bbc ,  started believing .
 opened up reddit and saw this ,  now i &apos;m just sitting here in disbelief .
 unrelated ,  i had no idea he was 76 .
 thanks for sharing that quote .
 i don &apos;t know why this hit me as hard as it did .
 i feel like i lost someone dear i knew  .
 rest in peace & thank you for all the inspiration and wisdom professor .
 they gave you 2 years in 1963 .
 holy shit ,  what a champ
 my aunt died 2 weeks ago ,  my grandfather died a few days ago and now i find this news out .
 i’m having a hard time keeping it together .
 professor and inspiration to so many
 he beat the hell out of the odds .
 i have no idea how he lived this long ,  but the world is better for it .
 god may not play dice with the universe .
 this quote you chose is interesting though .
 it &apos;s something einstein said ,  and it doesn &apos;t really have anything to do with god or chance/destiny .
 it was about quantum mechanics .
 einstein didn &apos;t like the theory ,  because he subscribed to scientific determinism ,  the idea that anything can be predicted through science .
 quantum mechanics is all about probabilities ,  and it makes it impossible to predict exactly what will happen at any given time .
 quantum mechanics theorizes that a particle is essentially a probability distribution (a wave function) ,  and heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle states that the more accurately you measure a particle &apos;s position ,  the less accurately you are able to measure its momentum (and therefore its velocity) .
 this is defined by δxδp  hπ ,  where δx is uncertainty in position ,  δp is uncertainty in momentum ,  and h is planck &apos;s constant .
 because of this inherent uncertainty built into quantum mechanics ,  it makes it impossible to predict exactly how a particle will behave in the future .
 as i said earlier ,  einstein didn &apos;t like this ,  and he said  &apos;god does not play dice with the universe &apos; in criticism of quantum mechanics .
 stephen hawking gave a lecture titled  &apos;does god  play dice &apos; in which he argued that not only is quantum mechanics a valid theory (this was widely accepted by this point as it &apos;s been experimentally verified over and over) ,  but black holes further hurt the case of scientific determinism because they destroy information ,  making it even more difficult to predict the future .
 so ,  interestingly enough ,  hawking &apos;s conclusion is that god does play dice with the universe .
 tl;dr hawking gave a lecture in which he concluded that god does play dice with the universe .
 if there was ever a wizard in this world ,  it was him .
 he was too busy deciphering the mysteries of the void to concern himself with petty affairs such as  &apos;movement &apos; and  &apos;physical activity .
 may he rest in peace .
 his charisma and wisdom weren &apos;t too shabby either .
 same ,  his ideas have always sparked me to think deeper about the universe around us ,  and he has been a great influence to the lives of many .
 for the sake of the species ,  don &apos;t give up .
 i realize fully how pretentious this sounds ,  but there &apos;s a reason this universe isn &apos;t populated with intergalactic civilizations .
 we might not know this reason but science is the only way we can ever hope to find out
 i thought he didn’t believe in the other side ?
 one ,  remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet .
 unless you &apos;re a geologist ,  in which case you probably should .
 he’s so iconic that i’m sure he’ll be a legend for many ,  many generations .
 well to be fair his contributions to the field aren &apos;t as significant as those of those guys but i &apos;m sure that for his still significant career and work outside of physics as a science communicator he won &apos;t be soon forgotten .
 the man &apos;s brilliance aside ,  this is the first time i &apos;ve seen his humour being appreciated .
 i didn &apos;t even realise that characteristic of his .
 i often find myself chuckling at some of the self deprecating jokes in his videos .
 that movie is great .
 also ,  you know that your book is good when it &apos;s being read by a wizard in the leaky cauldron in harry potter .
 we &apos;ve lost one of the world &apos;s greatest minds this day
 dying stars go out with the largest bang in the cosmos .
 at least he knows for sure wether or not there is an afterlife .
 in a statement his children ,  lucy ,  robert and tim ,  said:  &apos;we are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today .
 he was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years .
  &apos;he once said ,   &apos;it would not be much of a universe if it wasn &apos;t home to the people you love .
  &apos; we will miss him forever .
 that was perfect .
 toward the end: .
 moe: alright who &apos;s paying the tab ?
 hawking: i did not say that .
 for a second i was like  &apos;how is pi a different number in europe .
  &apos;  i guess it &apos;s bedtime .
 this is very sad news but it really is amazing how much he accomplished in spite of als .
 even more is that albert einstein was born on pi day
 i am so so sorry for your loss .
 i wish there were words to make it okay .
 internet hug and lots of strength for you .
 i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
 hang in there my friend 
 i am sorry for you losses .
 please keep looking up at the stars ,  and not down at your feet .
 make them proud ,  my friend .
 he ascended through space-time with good company .
 i don &apos;t know what to do with myself .
 i was in the same situation and you know what i did ?
 i opened up my laptop and started doing some homework .
 he would have loved for us to keep working and advance humanity &apos;s knowledge ,  right ?
 well ,  let &apos;s do just that : &apos;)
 wh-what do you mean .
 it &apos;s not raining .
 askreddit is one of the largest subreddits .
 they always have megathreads for major world events on the default subs
 today also happens to be albert einstein’s birthday .
 it &apos;s my top 9 posts on my front page .
  it really shouldn &apos;t be on /r/askreddit 
 i’m so happy that you found it again !
 the simpsons too :) .
 when visiting the set of star trek tng ,  he stopped by the transporter and said ,   &apos;i &apos;m working on that .
 he loved science fiction .
  he even had a small scifi show of his own where small scifi stories were made into hour long shows .
 he voiced himself .
 he is also featured on pink floyd &apos;s last album .
 spooky the episode of futurama he did was actually just on tv a few hours ago
 i loved when he was on comedy shows ,  the jokes he would say were usually made better by the deadpan delivery of the synthetic voice .
 truly the world lost a great man and mind .
 i fully believe a lesser man would have died back when he was supposed to; his intellect had other plans and was so strong he willed his body to live 50 years longer than it should have .
 the science and vision in his mind allowed him to visualize things most of us probably couldn &apos;t comprehend .
 although his body was frail ,  his mind allowed him to make the greatest adventures of all into the great abyss of the unknown; i would trade my able body in a heartbeat to think as he did and see things the way he saw them .
 the greatest mind i &apos;ll probably see in my lifetime .
 be at peace ,  professor ,  you earned it .
 also collaborated on a pink floyd song !
 yes they do ,  it &apos;s called  &apos;keep talking &apos; :)
 that man accomplished more than most people ever could with nothing but pure willpower .
 my purpose in life is to annoy the shit out of my wife and kids .
 i know that i will outlive them .
 as was said in the scrolls of shadizar .
 as someone with cystic fibrosis who was told since birth that i &apos;d die at age 30 ,  this hits home .
 and i already cheated death once so hopefully i can summon as much fight in me to keep going like hawking
 we needed him ,  and he stayed for us as long as he could .
 i feel that humanity has lost a lot of brainpower because of proff .
 we must just remember one thing he said;  &apos;we should not try to contact aliens because if they come here ,  they will look at us like we look at ants .
 yeah i &apos;ve read somewhere that it might not even be classified as als specifically .
 there is another theory that his wheelchair was sentient and kept him alive .
 wasn &apos;t he very hesitant have doctors run further tests on him ?
 heard it from an als researcher that doubted his diagnosis 
 it was the inheritable juvenile als that becoes apparent around tbe age of 20 .
 should you get the non-inheritable version ,  usually at the age of 30-40 ,  then the maximum life expectancy is 5 years .
 there is a theory that it is not really als as we know it but a variation .
 anyway he fought hard .
 i really would love to know what his last words were .
 i used to be 115 lbs heavier ,  no way would i have lived to his age
 i had a stark realization recently:  we were only blessed with stephen hawking &apos;s genius because of the technology that made it possible for him to communicate with the world .
  how many came before him and before this technology ,  without a way to express themselves ?
  that thought sends chills down my spine like few others .
 i recall a conversation from a few years ago where a couple doctors were discussing hawking and his als diagnosis .
 because literally almost no one survives as long as he had with als ,  they were convinced that he must have some other disease ,  perhaps a disease that medical science isn &apos;t yet aware of .
 so maybe he survived so long because he had something similar to als ,  but different .
 my dad had als and died about 4 months ago .
 which was only 1 year after his first symptom .
 at his funeral ,  many of his friends / coworkers told our family that he was the smartest man they had ever met .
 he was a lead electrical engineer .
 he has a great relationship with my mom ,  tons of friends ,  passions ,  and a stable positive outlook on life .
 he enjoyed being alive and wanted to be here .
 when he was getting weaker ,  the doctors made sure we knew that your will to live doesn’t matter much in fighting the disease .
 als doesn’t care how hard you fight it or how smart you are .
 it’s going to run its course the way it will regardless .
 every case of the disease is different .
 resources like a feeding tube and ventilator can help extend your life .
 so i would consider having those installed to be “fighting the disease .
 ” my dad didn’t want to extend his life with those because he couldn’t move his arms or legs ,  sit up ,  enjoy food ,  use the toilet ,  or breathe on his own .
 so what’s the point in extending a condition that requires strenuous 24/7 caregiving ?
 which is totally understandable because i wouldn’t either (no offense to anyone who decides to ,  but it’s very much a personal decision) .
 i really appreciate you asking this question because as ive been reading through comments that say he’s so strong for fighting the disease ,  i can’t help but want to scream “that’s not how it works !
 ” i know it’s a common phrase to use with any disease ,  and i’m not actually offended or upset .
 but i do know that if someone with als could slow or change the course of the disease with their mindset or intelligence level ,  my dad and many other people would still be around .
 only 300 ,  you poor simpleton .
 hope they can teach you to feed yourself .
 psssh ,  you need a far higher iq to understand the subtlety and nuance of the humor in rick and morty .
 wubba lubba dub dub !
 she can’t speak at all anymore but she does have a little tablet that she can type on to .
 i appreciate your thoughtfulness .
 my dad died after about 4 years .
 it always amazed me that stephen hawking was still kicking knowing what i know about the disease .
 i think the speed of the illness was one of the most shocking things for me .
 his interview with john oliver is also amazing too
 he will be remembered for ever .
  &apos;i’m not afraid of death ,  but i’m in no hurry to die .
 i have so much i want to do first .
 \- stephen hawking .
 he really lived by that quote ,  it &apos;s just too bad he didn &apos;t get to do more .
 what we do in life ,  echoes in eternity .
 we &apos;ve lost another brilliant mind ,  .
 a bittersweet goodbye ,  .
 now steve can leave his chair behind ,  .
 the hawk is in the sky .
 and here come the tears even worse .
 beautiful poem ,  and a tragically sad day .
 i just saw someone post a poem in relation to this .
 my first thought was you .
 i &apos;m so fucking glad you had something to say here .
 perfectly put ,  sprog .
 and on einstein &apos;s bday as well
 and born on the 300th anniversary of galileo &apos;s death ?
 almost makes you wonder
 he died on pi day too .
 what are the odds of that .
  why such a low target age ?
  i &apos;m shooting for 90 .
  but hopefully within 30 years ,  scientific breakthroughs will allow me to live to 100 .
 musk isn &apos;t a hawking .
 he &apos;s got big ideas and determination (and now the $ to see it through) but is no great mind like einstein or hawking .
 musk is nowhere near the level of stephen hawking .
 he’s just a billionaire who funds space ventures to chase profit and personal curiosity; the vast majority of the ideas he’s usually credited for come from the network of scientists ,  engineers ,  etc he employs .
 don’t let him take their credit ,  and definitely don’t say he has the same brilliance as hawking .
 i feel like his als is part of the reason he felt immortal .
 the fact that he made it so far despite being diagnosed with lou gehrig &apos;s disease ,  despite being given only a few years to live 50+ years ago .
 the guy was a legend ,  and the fact that he had made it this far almost made it same seem like death was out of the question .
 that &apos;s what makes this news all the more shocking and disheartening .
 i feel the exact same .
 when my friend told me i thought he was playing some sick joke .
 :( may he rest in peace
 i read the headline and thought ,   &apos;was he sick ?
 i mean ,  other than the als ?
 yes this made me pretty sad .
 i mean ,  he beat the odds all this time .
 this just seems kind of sudden to me .
 yea ,  i though he would merge with his computer well before that .
 i thought the same thing .
 stephen hawking was just always there .
 agreed ,  i do remember wondering a few times when he was going to pass but the actual thought never really occurred to me .
 he just kept kicking through so much .
 i feel like people probably felt the same about einstein .
 he was just kind a the genius of the time ,  and nobody expected for him to ever go away .
 weird fact ,  einstein also died at the age of 76 .
 he will be around forever in a way .
 we have his ideas that will live on .
 i completely agree .
 it &apos;s weird how we all are shocked .
 i guess i thought he &apos;d live past 100 or something ,  but i didn &apos;t realize it until now
 ya know ,  come to think of it i don &apos;t know that i &apos;ve ever heard a bad word about the guy .
 it &apos;s petty rare that a person can be as famous as he was without something coming out ,  or just making an ass of themselves ,  but he seems like he was above that .
 my body may be shackled ,  but my mind wanders free .
 on a similar note ,  i told my husband i was going to nebraska for a few days for a tournament and he said  &apos;nebraska ,  huh ?
 which state is that in again ?
 give it 60 years and we will see
 i was born this date in  &apos;92 .
 who knows what &apos;ll happen !
 omg reincarnation of einstein ?
 birth and death dates from galileo &apos;s time also weren &apos;t the most accurate .
 he could as well been 76 .
 only in america ,  and hawking was british .
 thought he was older .
 this mufucka been around forever .
 meanwhile i &apos;m  sitting here drinking carlo rossi like it &apos;s water hoping i live till 50 .
 god damn ,  i &apos;m an idiot .
 when you consider an askreddit mod a more trustworthy source of news than bbc .
 by making an  &apos;observation &apos; you killed him ,  bro
 creeps me out when this stuff happens .
 the day before yesterday i said to my girlfriend “the world is gonna go nuts when stephen hawking dies” and then she woke me up this morning to tell me this .
 a couple of days ago i was watching the big bang theory on tv ,  and stephen hawking was on it (the episode where howard makes his action figure) and my mom commented what a  spectacular man he was ,  and that he had a universe of his own in his mind .
 gnu stephen hawking ,  and gnu sir terry pratchett .
 i &apos;m feeling the same way .
 stephen hawking has been there my whole life .
 it feels really really weird to know that he &apos;s no longer with us .
 have a hug ,  and keep strong .
 want to vent about it ?
 maybe just texting it out could help .
 it &apos;s the best i can do from here .
 what did each mean to you ?
 shoot me a message ,  i &apos;m kind of stuck in life and wouldn &apos;t mind making a friend .
 sending so many internet hugs 
 i &apos;m sorry to read that-my condolences
 even when we lose the ones we love ,  they will live forever in our hearts .
 i &apos;m so sorry to hear that .
 hey man ,  i can &apos;t even imagine what you might be going through ,  but i can try my best to help .
 you can message me anytime if you would want someone to talk to 3
 it was like;  &apos;two years to live ?
 fuck that shit !
 i got science to do !
  &apos;  dude was as baller till the end .
 tangential but it has been really interesting seeing redditors grapple with respectfully noting the passing of someone who did not ,  himself ,  believe in an afterlife .
 people are so used to couching this stuff in those terms .
 we are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no god .
 no one created the universe and no one directs our fate .
 this leads me to a profound realization .
 there is probably no heaven ,  and no afterlife either .
 we have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe ,  and for that ,  i am extremely grateful .
  &apos;a wizard arrives precisely when he means to .
 maybe that explains the dates of his birth and death .
 i guess he knows now .
 he had such a shit-eating grin ,  you can tell he was enjoying himself there 
 his story of being an important contributor and populariser of science despite his condition will also help his legacy live on for at least a while .
 doing the work he did is impressive for an able bodied person ,  doing it with his condition is pretty damned inspirational and is part of the reason he &apos;s the icon he is/was .
 oh god ,  this made me tear up .
 “if there are an infinite number of parallel universes ,  is there one where i am smarter than you ?
 and also a universe where you’re funny”
  &apos;why should i not be excited about fighting a robot ?
  &apos;you would lose .
 sorry ,  that button sticks &apos; - prof .
  &apos;are you that guy who invented gravity ?
 whoa what are the odds of that ?
 0027378507871321 for anyone wondering ,  assuming we don &apos;t factor in stuff like people having more sex on weekends and valentines day and whatnot)
 yeah ,  not sure anyone would even know if it wasn &apos;t posted here
  &apos;homer ,  your theory of a donut shaped universe intrigues me .
 i will have to steal it .
 recurred on big bang theory as well .
 if you &apos;re looking for trouble ,  then you &apos;ve found it .
 another factoid re: tng .
 in the final episode there &apos;s a timeskip and picard meets data in the future .
 only ,  in this future he &apos;s  &apos;professor data &apos; and was the 24th individual to hold the lucasian chair of mathematics at university of cambridge .
 other notable lucasian proffessors ?
 professorship #2 - sir isaac newton .
 professorship #17 - stephen hawking
 do have any links to this ?
 i always wondered what that meant .
 did they send him a script ,  and he just retyped it ?
 how exactly did this go down ?
 their last two albums actually: keep talking on the division bell and talkin &apos; hawkin &apos; on the endless river .
 that &apos;s always been a favourite of mine .
 it doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
 all we need to do is keep talking .
 i always hated the division bell but after listening to that song i may have to revisit it .
 well ,  he was also a genius .
 likely a bit of medicine and technology might also have contributed .
 he also didn &apos;t lose any of his positivity .
 remember that tweet from 2016 halloween where he asked what should be his halloween costume ?
 my purpose in life .
 is to annoy the shit out .
 of my wife and kids
 yeah ,  there &apos;s a few theorys out there that say he didn &apos;t exactly have als but something very similar that probably had to do with him living way longer than expected .
 theres also an actual theory that he died long ago (as an als patient should have) and was replaced with a double .
 he probably didn &apos;t want to know at that point .
 you still might not !
 there’s many such cases around sadly .
 so many people not given the chance to contribute to humanity .
 my main example would be matvei bronstein .
 a russian physicist who was the first to realize that quantum gravity changes the nature of spacetime .
 he was arrested at an age of 30 and shortly thereafter excecuted because he believed in communism without stalinism .
 it’s hard to imagine how much he could’ve contributed .
 this is why we gotta give every kid (globally) a fighting chance to be successful .
 you never know who is going to solve the next major crisis .
 not only that ,  but could you imagine the pure frustration that would come from having such a brilliant mind ,  but absolutely no way of communicating .
 only ever being able to observe and unable to correct or build upon anyone &apos;s observations .
 how many child soldiers die at 15/16 ,  with no chance to become the next stephen hawking ?
 friend in med school has said something similar .
 one day they talked about als and someone brought up hawking and the prof more or less went “hes stephen fucking hawking ,  medical science gave up long ago telling him what he can and can’t do” before going into a serious discussion about how it could be something like als but they haven’t figured it out yet .
 begone mere mortals ,  for i have achieved an iq so high that no one but i can even conceive of the number .
 absolutely ,  my heart goes out to you .
 if for whatever reason you need a stranger to talk to ,  i &apos;ll be available .
 yeah ,  it &apos;s tragic .
 been there as well .
 both my mums parents died of als ,  my grandfather before i was born and my grandmother when i was 10 .
 i remember having the board ,  it &apos;s almost worse than not talking .
 i just remember my grandma getting so frustrated when we didn &apos;t get what she was saying .
 my whole heart goes out to you and i hope that it doesn &apos;t get harder because the worst part is it doesn &apos;t get easier .
 it &apos;s crazy that hawking survived so long with it .
 it &apos;s testament to what sheer human willpower can do .
 i wish you all the best man .
 i will have to check that out :)
 considering he was given two to four years to live after his diagnosis ,  i &apos;d say its quite amazing what he did achieve .
 but i agree that even two more years would &apos;ve been wonderful .
 i feel bad for wasting so much time on reddit
 this was very clever ,  i &apos;m sorry if ya get overshadowed .
 hadn &apos;t started crying until this comment .
 this quote is great for grieving people in general ,  and made me tear up .
 and he died at the same age as einstein 
 we must find the next reincarnation !
 and on einstein &apos;s birthday .
 somewhere out there ,  the next avatar great scientific mind just got reincarnated
 then rationality sets in .
 the stars black holes aligned .
 born on galileo &apos;s deathday and dies on einstein &apos;s birthday .
 it seems practical .
 i have a gut feeling the average life expectancy isn &apos;t going to go up much in the u .
 also heart disease and cancer is not uncommon in my family and to top it off i &apos;m very uncoordinated and trip over my own feet lol .
 with that in mind ,  who are  the next rounds of hawking and einstein .
 seems like a really small field .
 or perhaps science is too splintered now and no one can follow in the footsteps of these giants ?
 and the fact that he never let his disease stop him from living his life .
 i found out from a gif on here ,  i almost called the person a lying shit but googled it first .
 i was heartbroken ,  that man is extraordinary 
 i said to my mom “i wonder what happened” .
 she just looked at me like “he had als” .
 of course ,  i just didn’t look at him that way .
 what a great man .
 i guess he was just sort of perpetual .
 he was doing stuff before me ,  i guess i expected him to just keep doing things until after me .
 it just never crossed my mind that he would be gone or that he wouldn &apos;t be the first cyborg or brain uploaded to the internet or something .
 i &apos;m gonna go watch a documentary 
 somehow i just thought he &apos;d never die
 we might have bit too much into the sentient wheelchair theory .
 a few years if he/she turns out to be a child prodigy .
 einstein was still alive when he was born .
 well considering there &apos;s no 14th month ,  if you celebrate pi day you need to do so with an american calendar ,  educators all over the world celebrate it today .
 i thought he was like 50 .
 the most surprising news to me was finding out he’s 76 !
 if you &apos;re feeling like this news is a wakeup call ,  answer it .
 deep down you know who you are and what you can be .
 nobody is guaranteed any amount of time alive ,  so be you .
 i wonder who else is on his list 
 i did this to the last pope too .
 as well as my sisters dog .
 what the hell have you done .
 the world has been continuously going nuts for quite some time ,  so her statement was a safe bet .
 the story goes is that whole touring the set he paused in front of the warp core and said he was working on that .
 because we are made of the same elements as a star .
 conversely ,  when a person dies they can turn into a star .
 they even had a mini remote control version of him in one of the episodes he was in .
 looking forward to the dedication note that put on the next episode of bbt ,  which will unfortunately be in over 2 weeks due to march madness .
 high hopes always hits me like a goddamn truck .
  if nothing else ,  listen to the last track on the album .
 now we can study his brain !
 and also a great deal of luck along the way .
 great minds keeping great minds alive .
 yeah ,  with that strong of a willpower it must have been magic .
 i know that i will .
  as was said in .
 the shadizar scrolls
 yea probably because als is a bitch and bad illness .
 took a friend away in two years 
 my aunt was diagnosed with als in the 60s too .
 she’s in her 80’s now .
 maybe similar for her .
 and theres a theory that that his double is was a time traveller .
 he’s with tupac at the illuminati hotel in cuba .
 this is incredible and fucked up at the same time
 i was expecting a rick roll .
 this was so much better
 if i were him ,  i would &apos;ve programmed my speech computer to say  &apos;ha ha ha &apos; in a week or so if i felt my death coming .
 and put this sound on a shortcut .
 this is honestly something he probably would’ve thought hilarious
 you fucking savage .
 i feel so ashamed for snort-laughing at that
 savage ,  pure savage .
 here’s your upvote .
 i can’t stop laughing 
 i didn &apos;t even have to turn my sound on to know what it is .
 i see you like to browse r/imgoingtohellforthis as well .
 aahh that was amazing .
 holy fuck ,  that was brutal .
 good lord that was beautiful .
 take an upvote you heathen
 you started a meme in a discord server
 i &apos;m upvoting you because professor hawking would have loved that joke .
 i was crying over his death ,  thank you for making me laugh .
 the connection to the server has timed out .
 404 error: page not found
 thanks for the kind thoughts !
 hardcore as fuck
 so many people not given the chance to contribute to humanity .
 i think about that pretty often .
 without the singlest shred of doubt ,  there are absolute geniuses who could have changed the world ,  but either died too young or were denied the means to do so .
 probably hundreds if not thousands of them .
 or even more than that .
 wow ,  just looked him up .
 thanks for making me laugh guys ,  going through a shitty depression episode and hearing about the professor &apos;s death makes me feel worse but at least i was able to laugh in this moment
 that &apos;s nice ,  but at least i have a high enough iq to understand rick and morty .
 you will never know true humor .
 #this guy ricks and morties
 this individual u/admiralbiff watches the television series known as  richard and mortimer on adult swim .
 i took an iq test last week and scored a perfect 100 .
 try to beat that 
 i bet your iq &apos;s at least countable .
 my iq is transfinite .
 reddit can be education .
 it &apos;s whatever you make it to be .
 i &apos;ve learned so much from science ,  tech ,  diy ,  history ,  art subreddits:)
 it made me bust out crying holy fuck .
 it &apos;s almost as if stephen chose this date on purpose .
 yeah ,  just gotta wait till march 14th ,  2318
 then ,  everything changed when the anti-intellectuals attacked .
 also newton &apos;s birthday and marx &apos;s deathday .
 also my birthday .
 hopefully it &apos;s not some taiwanese child that dies at 8 years old from being worked to death .
 that &apos;s a good point: about the fields being splintered .
 i honestly don &apos;t know .
 the general public only really knows their names ,  not the details of their work so that might be a place to start .
 america doesn &apos;t focus on tbe academics like it should .
 stopped him from living his life ?
 he did way much more than just lived his life !
 he did more than vast majority of people can ever hope to do !
 that man deserves a statue so big it shifts earths center of gravity !
 stephen hawking was my first dive into space and 4th dimension theories .
 remember seeing his first documentary in the mid 90 &apos;s .
 i was flipping the channel from nickelodeon .
 i think it was either the history or discovery channel .
 this hits really close to home .
 well i would expect nothing less from the next science avatar .
 you get your logic and throw it out the fuckin window .
 we don’t need that shit here
 pi approximation day is 7/22 !
  &apos;chief ,  we got a lead on the quantum killer .
 i know a couple of billionaire politicians i &apos;d like to nominate .
 i am filled with deep regret .
 (honestly ,  i know it’s just a coincidence but i do really feel weird about it because it feels like i was so flippant about it at the time ,  even within serious conversation and now i’m bummed that it’s real)
 what a badass line .
 i can &apos;t imagine i &apos;d be that witty .
 not even sure if those are his theories ,  but it seemed fitting .
 i love march madness and enjoy bbt ,  so i &apos;m cool with that (my team has a key injury and this at least helped give a little perspective on that loss) .
 they might be smart enough to have some film in the can for a sendoff ,  i hope .
 oh fuck ,  they &apos;re going to lose it like they did kennedy &apos;s i just know it .
 some sort of stand power
 you die from not being able to breath .
 he was on a respirator .
 that is what kept him alive .
 i imagine he had near zero muscle control/mass .
 maybe even just the ability to look around ,  and blink .
 i do not know this for a fact ,  just a guess .
 my grandfather died from als .
 it is a horrible disease .
 god speed professor hawking .
 wouldn &apos;t it be cool if it really was some kind of magic or x-men mutation or something .
 his genius brain was actually so beyond the average homosapiens and was in fact what we write about in fantasy and science fiction .
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .
  &apos;what &apos;s going on .
 is the box broken ?
  &apos;no sir ,  he &apos;s hacked the mainframe and taken control of everything on the network .
 it’s taken about two dozen people in my family .
 just went to another funeral in february .
 well he did attend his own time travelling party .
 lol this is soooo fucked up
 i too fear the  &apos;rick &apos;  &apos;roll &apos; .
 or sing “daisy bell” slowly as he dies 
 or make it to where millions of alexa units would randomly do it instead .
 baaaaaaaammmm he went there .
 i really don &apos;t like crying over the deaths of famous people .
  but this and robin williams really choke me up .
 could always use some morbid motivation .
 hey ,  you &apos;re not that guy !
 stay strong ,  my friend ,  there are always highs and lows (at least for me) ,  sometimes the highs just take a little climbing ,  i &apos;m rooting for you 3 
 pffft ,  transfinite ,  when will you people learn ?
 there are only two kinds of iq !
 you just passed up perhaps the most perfect opportunity for a rickroll .
 you could have caught hundreds ,  nay thousands of us teary-eyed innocents !
 this ,  exactly this .
 this applies so well to the internet ,  too .
 it will a resource for anything ,  depending on what you make of it .
 this stuff has to be connected .
 except he &apos;s english ,  so its 14 .
 if he reincarnates then anyway ,  not much of an issue .
 america doesn &apos;t focus on tbe academics like it should .
 and you know that ,  of course .
 the usa public is really quite ignorant when it comes to these things .
 we all expect the release of the new apple phone and all the tech that comes with it .
 but no one can name the person who ,  20 years back ,  developed the breakthrough technology to bring us 4k photos or video with no artifacts ,  or what have you .
 we have grown into a consumer society that simply expects everything will always improve .
 yet we know nothing about why it would improve and have no regard for those who do the work .
 this is ,  depending on who you read or listen to ,  the beginning of dystopia or an ai takeover .
 fuck dude ,  that &apos;s one hell of a comic .
 it was definitely the same with michael .
 i liked how the other dude was doing the moonwalk in the background .
 be right back ,  i have a story to write .
 he double sleeved .
 didn &apos;t someone do that in a  &apos;who are you surprised is still alive ?
  &apos; thread and kill harper lee ?
 i really hope they give his whole head to matt groening
 to be fair ,  most of kennedy &apos;s brain was lost already .
 not sure if shot in head joke or something actually happened with his brain .
 or it will be in someone &apos;s basement like einstein &apos;s brain was .
 wouldn &apos;t it be hilariously ironic for a man ,  stuck in a chair ,  to have a stand ?
 stand masterstephen hawking .
 stand nameblack holes and revelations
 “life would be tragic if it weren’t funny” .
 hi there ,  i am interested in your rentals please .
 i am throwing a party and i would like it to be attacked by some monsters to spice things up .
 also ,  what are the rates on babuskas ?
 i’m looking to get 3 for a few hours as i need someone to mash potatoes for me .
 and are the nesting dolls included or do i bring my own ?
 thanks ,  any information is appreciated .
 sorry i must &apos;ve just accidentally switched accounts .
 but what would be the good in that ?
 everyone please take a moment and do what you can for net neutrality :) 
 should we call nicolas cage to see if any treasures are hidden in the secrets ?
 are we about to launch to next iteration of reddit investigates ?
 yeah true but that taiwanese kids delays the next reincarnation by however long it lives .
 pretty inconsiderate if you ask me .
 your aiming this at the us but i don &apos;t think thats fair .
 can you point me to one other country where the average citizen could name the person who invented 4k photos ?
 i think most of it has to do with large corporations having teams invent these new technologies and the names mean nothing to us .
 the only reason the founder of spacex and tesla is well known is because of his eccentric personality .
 and he can transplant the brain into homer .
 kennedy had a little brain .
 a little here ,  a little there .
 the smithsonian has been known to lose samples .
 like the original moon landing reels and parts of kennedy &apos;s brain .
 and then become a turtle ?
 ability: it makes it so you can &apos;t walk
 something i thought of earlier (probably said many times before) but felt like i was quoting michael scott: “anything is a joke as long as someone laughs” right after making an offensive comment to someone where he was the only one laughing
 oops did it again .
  &apos;i &apos;m going to steal stephen hawking &apos;s wheelchair &apos;
 tom hanks would be better ,  since this appears to be more of a davinci code situation .
 just don &apos;t travel with the man .
 no but we should keep track of everyone born on einstein &apos;s birthday
 i think he &apos;d go more futurama .
 the employees in the 60s were just on drugs and fucked up the filing .
  &apos;it got bettah &apos; ?
 well ,  nobody &apos;s perfect .
  &apos;i fly to hawking &apos;s chair .
 i shrink the chair ,  i grab the chair ,  i sit on the toilet- wait ,  what ?
 you may be tempted to go for one .
 and you’ll have about $76 left over .
 fully humbled by the awards ,  kind friends .
 nice try jeff bezos
  your productivity will increase dramatically .
 a nasal irrigation kit - either the electronic pump or simply the squeeze bottles .
 i started using them both leading up to surgery on my sinuses ,  and i haven &apos;t stopped using them since .
 it takes some getting used to ,  but the relief and clean feeling is amazing .
 aeropress coffee maker .
 the thing broke my wife of her $200( ?
 ) monthly starbucks habit .
 the unit costs maybe $25 or so .
 they will make you happy looking after them .
 i recently bought a venus fly trap ,  she caught her first fly today .
 that fucker kept me fed during depression when i barely had the energy to get out of bed .
 takes less than nothing to get some rice in there and flip the switch .
 want something sweet ?
 throw coconut and sugar in there .
 want flavor but can’t be fucked to make anything ?
 get some spanish rice or saffron goin .
 you can throw tofu in there with it if you need  .
 yeah it’s not the best for you but hot food is better than no food .
 new pair of socks .
 if you’ve been wearing the same pairs forever like i typically usually do theirs nothing like putting on a new pair of freshly bought socks ,  you can totally feel the difference ,  i never realized til was an adult sadly but i appreciate the feeling of new socks all the time .
 i bought a $1 back scratcher from an asian market in town .
 best $1 i ever spent .
 a decent light wake up alarm clock .
 completely changed my mornings .
 don’t think i could ever go back to using my phone or a simple alarm clock .
 if you have trouble getting up or functioning in the morning ,  and like a nice cup of coffee or tea ,  an electric kettle with a timer can be a real game-changer .
 or just getting an electric kettle if you don &apos;t have one .
 a king sized blanket for a queen sized bed .
 this post cost me over 400$ so far
 sharp knives for the kitchen
 a glass breaker on a keychain .
 push it against the glass of your car window and it shatters immediately ,  helping you get out of a car underwater ,   broken door etc .
 super cheap and life saving
 in my opinion definitely a weighted blanket if you have a hard time sleeping at night or have anxiety .
 they have some at target for $25 currently :)
 motion sensor night lights .
 can’t tell you how many stubbed toes or falls they have prevented .
 also a cheap intruder alarm .
 carbon monoxide detector
 more than one 10mm socket .
 blackout curtains for your bedroom .
 may sound simple ,  but a good pillow .
 it is amazing the change in body aches ,  and sleep you see when you have a good pillow that fits you .
 no skin cancer for me
 an air compressor to air up your tires .
 got one off amazon for 30 bucks .
 a 10 foot charging cable  .
 or a quality pair of shoes
 national park annual pass
 step 1: throw away all your socks .
 step 2: buy 3-5 packages of the same sock .
 step 3: enjoy a life without ever having to match socks again .
 a good shop vac .
 you will not believe how many uses around the house you &apos;ll find for it .
 cobweb removal ,  water removal ,  gravel removal ,  vent cleaning ,  soot trap cleaning ,  (after a good scrub since it &apos;s likely dirty from other tasks) car vacuuming ,  dust sucking ,  the list goes on .
 seriously if you plan to buy or already own a home go get a shop vac .
 fitted sheet straps .
 they keep cheap sheets from popping up at the corners .
 so now i can use soft sheets that don &apos;t cost a fortune and my sleep is undisturbed by them popping loose ,  greatly improving my quality of life .
 a basic skincare routine .
 i’m talking like cleanse ,  moisturize ,  sunscreen ,  and if you’re really adventurous/ in need ,  get yourself a topical for acne or concerns .
 amazing for your self esteem ,  and also becomes a form of self care eventually .
 it’s so easy to forget to take care of yourself .
 light hearted ,  but .
 a pressure cooker !
 you can get one for around $100 ,  and it can easily cook a genuinely staggering variety of food ,  and cook it well .
 til there are two types of people that use pressure cookers .
 people who use them to cook food ,  and people who use them to make bombs .
 and people who use it to sterilize things .
 an electric kettle .
 a dash cam for your car can protect you from wrongful claims also vandalisms and theft
 a good showerhead .
 i cannot stress enough how a high quality showerhead can turn getting clean into utterly zen ,  30 minute self healing and relaxation session .
 ok clarification ,  i don &apos;t shower for 30 min every day .
 modern rain showerheads use very little water and i only have about 15 min to get ready in the morning so this is a rare treat i let myself do once or twice a month .
 i appreciate the loving comments .
 24(m) ,  i bought a book online about sql for like 25 bucks and then a course on udemy for like 11 .
 but went from a job earning 35 , 000 to 55 , 000 because i took time to learn a new skill .
 and if i end up staying and becoming a higher level analyst ,  salary is around 7075k  .
 maybe data analysis isn’t your gig ,  but learning a skill can be cheap in terms of money: more time consuming than anything but worthwhile .
 a good chef &apos;s knife and a cast iron skillet .
 when you have tools that are satisfying to use ,  cooking becomes less  &apos;chore &apos; and more  &apos;hobby &apos; .
 you &apos;ll end up eating healthier ,  cheaper than takeout/restaurant ,  and ditching the dull walmart knife and scratched up nonstick aluminum skillet are the best place to start .
 editing to add: .
 since so many are asking what to get: victorinox 8 &apos; or 10 &apos; chef &apos;s knife ,  and 10 &apos; lodge cast iron skillet .
 these in my opinion are at the tippy top of the curve on quality to price ratio .
 these probably leave enough room in the budget to get a $2 steel from goodwill and a large butcher block cutting board .
 as long as you use the steel with some regularity ,  a good knife should go a long time before it actually needs to be sharpened .
 second  i agree that a good sharpener is important ,  but if you have $100 to spend today you can wait on sharpener as long as you have a steel to maintain the edge .
 you will need one ,  but not today .
 also i am going to take another look at carbon steel skillets .
  bought my eno a year ago and i have no idea what i did without it ,  you can literally post up anywhere and everywhere and it will encourage you to go outside a lot more .
 an electric toothbrush
 a used instrument
 ssds are a gift from god .
 although ,  it depends where in the world you are  .
 where i am it is less than the equivalent of us$100
 i got a silk pillowcase because i have really really long hair (down to my butt) and it keeps it from tangling as badly overnight .
 as a canadian it is really upsetting to hear about all the things that can supposedly be had for $100 in other places .
 no more cutting open meat to see if it’s done ,  thus leaking juices
 a good every day carry pocket knife .
 i use mine serveral times a day .
 carbon monoxide alarm ,  please get one .
 a kindle or library card  .
 a juicer/blender  .
 a donation to adopt a pet from an animal shelter  .
 a folding wagon .
  getting groceries in the house ,  camping gear ,  etc we always have it in the car and you can do 5 trips worth by hand effortlessly .
 knowledge is currency that only increases
 upgraded my box spring ,  pillow ,  and purchased a sound machine before lockdown .
 i &apos;ve had more solid sleep and am having quite more pleasant days .
 i live with anxiety and ptsd and am a cannabis user (medically / proper channels) .
 as a father of 3 (4th in route) ,  life is simply compounding with interior place issues .
 after i upgraded my box spring and pillow i purchased .
 a sound machine .
 to be honest ,  each of these three things with elevate your sleeping and alter you days to come; not to mention the medical .
  each of these things are separately  $100 .
 a desk for laptop .
 seriously using it on bed or somewhere else isn &apos;t as great as it &apos;s on a desk .
 also a comfortable chair .
 my mom always said that having one use appliances is a waste of money and space ,  and as an adult now i generally agree .
 no quesadilla makers ,  donut/cake pop machines ,  etc .
 i spent almost ten years of my adult life boiling rice on the stove and often times messing it up .
 it should be simple but for me it just isn’t .
 i bought a rice cooker on sale and oh man .
 it’s even got a steamer basket so it’s not even technically a one use appliance .
 perfect rice every time ,  and you can set it and forget it until it’s time to eat .
 frees up a stove burner ,  and meals where i cook rice now feel a lot easier .
 i’m willing to die on this hill .
 a collar that you can put ice cubes in to help keep you cool .
 i do a decent amount of outside and digging jobs and this thing probably saved me from heatstroke .
 and only 20 bucks
 a good set of cookware .
   whether its pots and pans ,  or a good chef &apos;s knife ,   every investment i make in my kitchen increases my quality of life .
 i feel like a few people are being deliberately negative about this .
 for those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars i encourage you to temper your expectations of what  &apos;good &apos; is and check out amazon right now .
 if you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now .
 ceramic cookware is what i started learning to cook on .
  its not perfect but it &apos;s a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there .
 if you prefer iron like i do ,  lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now .
 pair that with a decent chef &apos;s knife from mercer $45 (the brand i am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating .
 ) and you &apos;re good to go .
 those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them .
 a shepherd &apos;s pie ,  pizza ,  fresh bread ,  soups and stews ,  stir fry .
 i mean almost anything .
  pro tip ,  even if it says preseasoned ,  look up how to season it anyway .
 and never use soap on your iron .
  scrub it in the sink under hot water ,  heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast ,  when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils .
 just a thin layer with a paper towel will do .
 edit : thank you so much for 3 .
 this is most i &apos;ve ever gotten !
 if you want information on how to progress ,  please look at  u/coltsfan10395 comment below .

 good pair of shoes
 i bought 8 meals (meal preps) for $96 for someone .
  it helped them through a hard time and provided hope .
  they just got their own place now and can comfortably afford all their meals on their own .
 damn it i was going to cash in this good karma for something in life ,  not fake internet point .
 a weighted blanket
 paprika recipe app and the corresponding software for your pc .
 the thing is a miracle .
 not only can you download recipes from websites - it pulls the recipe and instructions out and leaves all the chaff ( &apos;my grandmother always told me when she made this apple pie that it reminded her of the time that  .
  &apos;) - but you can add ingredients to your grocery list right from the recipe ,  create meal plans and menus ,  and share access with another person (they have to buy the app too and use shared login) .
 it &apos;s changed the way i meal plan ,  shop ,  and cook .
 seriously ,  i love my instant pot more than i loved my first slow cooker .
 it changed summer cooking for me forever .
 so many comments and questions !
 i get all my recipes and food ideas from youtube channels .
 too many to mention here .
 i bought the zest pot because it was cheaper - i use it mainly for casseroles ,  chili ,  rice and pasta dishes .
 it gets so hot in here that it &apos;s nice not to turn on the oven !
 thx for the award kind strangers and to all of y’all for your recommendations .
 i’m definitely enjoying reading this .

 a brita filter water pitcher and reusable bottles .
 i cut out most drinks aside from water back in october and we were going through 2+ cases a week .
 it was expensive ,  heavy ,  took up way too much space and was such a waste of plastic !
 i ended up buying a brita pitcher from walmart for about $18 .
 we fill it up 2 or 3 times a day and everyone has their own water bottle now .
 when quarantine started and no one could find bottled water ,  but we were good !
 there were so many positives to buying the brita pitcher that i wish i had bought it years ago !
 many people aren &apos;t aware of the psoas muscle and its role in tying the body together; a great deal of lower back/glute/hamstring pain stems from a tight psoas ,  as well as pain in the abdomen ,  upper back - the list goes on .
 the psoas is a muscle that runs through the core ,  tying the hips to the upper abdomen ,  making it the literal crossroads of the body .
 pso-rite is expensive for a seemingly easy to recreate piece of plastic ,  but my god .
 i &apos;ve been involved in athletics my entire life ,  bodybuilding and powerlifting since i was 18 (now 26) and am a big fan of stretching ,  rolling ,  using lacrosse balls on my back and feet etc .
 when my roommate ordered it and it came in he told me to lay on it as low and close to my hips as i could and breathe .
 slowly at first i lowered my psoas onto this monster to immediate pain as a lifetime of use ,  abuse ,  and outright neglect were all suddenly addressed .
 pain ,  then it got easy ,  so i went a little further .
 pain ,  then it got easy ,  so i went a little further .
 in a matter of maybe 3 minutes i literally felt like a changed man .
 i can not recommend it enough .
 we brought it on vacation and let our friends try it ,  the reviews were all the same  &apos;this sucks it hurts hahah this is shit .
 oh wow my back doesn &apos;t hurt anymore ?
 clarification on the role of the psoas
 your first mechanical keyboard .
 but the second one will be over 100 usd .
 you just said life changing ,  it doesn’t need to be a good thing .
 a used greenhouse .
 growing plants in a greenhouse is one of the most rewarding things ever .
 you can raise so many amazing plants in there and working in the garden is great for mental health .
 probably saved my life .
 caring for plants and making them thrives gives me purpose .
 this is probably here but a tongue scraper .
 i brush my teeth often and floss and could still say my mouth felt yucky even a few hours after waking upa and eating nothing sometimes .
 but a tongue scraper is great .
 you scrape your tongue when getting ready in the mornings and after you eat it it makes your mouth feel fresher then mouth wash sometimes .
 add that into your brushing routine it &apos;s like 5 or $6 and it goes a long way for oral hygiene
 a whole bunch of lsd
 a real lava lamp .

 it’s honestly such a stress reliever to have those balls of wax bouncing around as you try to fall asleep .

 my wife wants me to add to the list: a food scale ,  it &apos;s invaluable for calorie tracking .
 you just put your plate on the scale ,  zero it out ,  then add each food and write down the weights .
 that way you can log what you are without any measuring cups etc .

 i feel like my skin is actually clean when i get out of the shower and theyre pretty thin and easy to dry ,  unlike loofas and similar products .
 probably not very good for sensitive skin but i love them
 it was completely free for me to pick up a naloxone kit from my local pharmacy .
 when i called about picking one up ,  they scheduled a free training 1 on 1 with me so that i knew how to administer it in the event of an overdose .
 being in university and having parties around our place made it seem necessary to have one ,  just in case .
 (never had to use it)
 you never realize how useful it is until you have one .
  you think your teeth are clean ?
 holy jeezus its amazing
 a planner diary and a personal journal
 100 ft ethernet cable .
 technology has not yet improved to the point where wireless communication is reliable or fast enough to compare to wired .
 for large downloads and gaming ,  anyway .
 wifi is fine for anything you could do on a phone .
 for boob-havers out there ,  a really good bra that looks great alone and under almost everything ,  fits really well ,  and you &apos;re not dying to take it off at the end of the day .
 they do exist ,  even for the  &apos;busty ,  &apos; like myself .
 it requires an outlay of cash ,  but you don &apos;t need to pay $100+ for it .
 a detachable shower head .
 you can spray down all of those hard-to-reach places !
 a squatty potty .
 you never know when you &apos;re going to need a knife .
 a lot of good comments already .
 as a dude ,  i will add: a decent shave kit .
 i use a safety razor from merkur ,  the handle is like $40 ,  you can buy cheaper ones .
 amazon has a hundred options you can browse .
 shave cream: my go-to is truefitt & hill ,  it’s $25-$35 for a tub ,  but it works amazingly well ,  and the scents they use smell very natural and not like perfumed chemicals .
 a tub lasts 6+ months ,  so the cost/shave isn’t crazy .
 a brush: these go from $10 to like a grand if you’re into that .
 mine was about $25 and seems to do the trick .
 the nicer ones have longer ,  softer bristles ,  but some prefer coarser bristles to exfoliate a bit .
 i’m not sure that they really do much good there ,  but at any rate you can find a perfectly acceptable brush for $25 or so .
 and the kicker: a shaving scuttle ,  so you get a warm lather .
 if you shop a bit that’s under $100 .
 turns shaving from a chore into a really enjoyable part of the old morning routine .
 blades are like $0 .
 15 each ,  so if you’re currently using a mach iii type thing at $3/blade ,  it pays for itself in the long run .
 they don &apos;t tell you this in school ,  but the ducks in the park are free .
 wait why do you need two you can torment people with just one  .
 nvm i now realize it’s so that you can still torment people with one while the other is sleeping
 worth every penny to not have that wet plastic ever touch you again !
 do you ever have issues with the floor getting wet ?
 also ,  wouldn &apos;t the liner thing still be inside the shower ,  at the same distance ,  so what would make it feel larger ?
 but maybe you are right .
 +1 ,  but not just for productivity .
 it’s really nice to be able to watch things while doing something else ,  something that you just can’t properly do without 2 monitors .
 would strongly recommend .
 make sure you only use distilled water for nasal irrigation .

 glad you’re ok now dude ,  had the same feeling a year ago and a rice cooker was my go-to ,  or pot noodles lol .
 would it help wake up non-morning people like myself ?
 this was a lifesaver for me .
 i made a special trip to my office once mandated work from home started in march because i need it .
 after i got it ,  i got some weird looks from office mates but started to see them picking them up too .

 i got a king for a double bed .
 best decision ever !
 the double sheets fit the bed ,  but i couldn &apos;t snuggle completely under them without curling up .
 i can hide completely under the duvet stretched out .
 best thing ever in the winter !
 i have a king size bed ,  and even king size comforters are kind of small ,  so my partner and i have two king size comforters — one one each side ,  so no one has to share .
 for $12 ,  you should tell us the brand !
 i &apos;ve been looking at buying one for camping ,  but if a weighted one it &apos;s as good as you say it is it could be with that extra investment .
 ya &apos;ll have money ?
 my first thought when i saw your comment was  &apos;dang !
 that &apos;s a lot of awards he gave out !
 i put off buying a whet stone for a long time ,  mostly because i was nervous i would use it wrong and ruin my knifes ,  but its not too hard at all if you get one with an angle guide .
 makes chopping stuff up faster ,  easier & safer
 knives in general can easily be life changing .
 something else that really helped with sleeping for me is a bottle that keeps water cold (mizu or whatever) .
 being able to drink ice cold water at any time during the night without leaving your bed changes everything .
 does it get hotter and swampier under a weighted blanket compare to a normal one ?
 always thought they were for autistic kids but bought one based on a similar post raving about it ,  why not ?
  cant sleep without it now .
 first two night sucked cause i toss and turn but after that i adapted to not doing that and have the best sleep ive ever had .
 additional side benefit ,  my partner doesnt like it so its all mine .
 get a motion activated toilet bowl light .
  don &apos;t kill your eyes in the middle of the night when you gotta pee .
 post-it notes are far cheaper !
 eh ,  i had to take the batteries out of mine .
 the beeping was making me sleepy and giving me a headache .
 i don &apos;t remember writing this .
 not even a couple weeks ago my cousin and her boyfriend rented a cabin that had a co leak .
 she has been recovering from a coma and has just started moving her extremities and regaining her voice .
 her boyfriend died .
 i hope just one person reading this realizes that it’s time to get one .
 excuse me while i cry ,  one 7/16th of an inch at a time
 i was just working on my motorcycle last night and picked up my 10mm socket and thought “see ya later good buddy” as i knew i’d prob lose it by the end of the night .
 /r/justrolledintotheshop feels your pain
 changes your life if you want to sleep all day ,  i refuse to have them in my room after living like a vampire for a few years
 worth it for weekend sleep ins alone .
 as a shift worker ,  i couldn &apos;t exist without mine .
 great of a weekend too when i just want an amazing nap too
 i thought that i liked memory foam and other fancy pillows ,  but the real life changer for me was a buckwheat pillow .
 i have sleep apnea ,  and it allows me to get my head into the perfect position and keep it there comfortably .
 before you go out and buy one ,  please research the pro &apos;s and cons .
 they aren &apos;t for everyone .
 consider them if you like a firmer pillow ,  occasionally wake up with an achey neck from lack of support ,  and want a pillow that breathes well .
 someone in the comments has also pointed out that you will win every pillow fight you get into .
 downsides are: if you shift around in your sleep a lot ,  you &apos;ll need to adjust the pillow to fit your new position .
 adjusting the pillow and settling in makes a little bit of noise as the buckwheat husks rub against each other ,  kind of like dry leaves crinkling .
 some people are also allergic to buckwheat ,  but there are other similar fillings such as millet husks .
 organic fillings also need to be replaced once in a while ,  since it breaks down over time .
 how does one find the perfect pillow .
 time to start my journey into the world of pillow-shopping - thank you everyone for the responses !
 my neck pain ,  back pain and headache want to second that .
 i &apos;m looking for a better pillow !
 i &apos;m not in america so all the american suggestions but not work .
 i &apos;m already looking for a new pillow ,  i know what to look for ,  that isn &apos;t the problem .
 on a similar note a good body pillow .
 it adds great support for your knees for all you side sleepers out there .
 you can also pretend that it’s another human if you’re lonely like me .
 for anyone that disagrees with this comment .
  i &apos;ve had multiple skin cancer surgeries .
  it &apos;s not the scalpel cutting flesh away from your body that hurts the most during the procedure ,  it &apos;s whatever liquid they inject into you to deaden the nerves around the cancer that hurts .
  the needles don &apos;t hurt but that shit they inject into you is f &apos;ing nasty .
 wear your sunscreen kids .
 basically a battery in a box that has battery clamps .
 for jump-starting your vehicle .
 get one that has a dc/ac outlet so you can use it to power small electronics when you have a power outage at home .
 i would not recommend combination jumper/air compressor units .
 would suggest separate jumper and air compressor .
 note: doesnt hurt to have actual old fashioned  jumper cables too .
 now i want an air compressor .
 can you use it to clean your car too ,  like weird spots ?
 blow air at them ?
 fuck me im reading this hunched over with my phone plugged in to an impossibly short charging cable .
 a 10 foot charging cable  .
 only if of god quality .
 otherwise it might lose enough voltage over is length for the phone to not charge .
 been there done that .
 i meant good quality .
 god quality is overkill for this application .
 edit 2: christ if i get another response recommending to buy an anker cable i &apos;m going to drown myself .
 if you’re a veteran with any % disability rating ,  they’re free for life .
 100% percent agree ,  i went on a 2 year journey and visted almost all of the national parks ,  my favorite was sequoia !
 useful on a plane too .
 with minor hearing loss from too many concerts in my 20s ,  i have to turn the volume to nearly max on a plane ,  so i usually just put in earplugs and can &apos;t watch or listen to anything ,  but this would help .
 i used to only have these specific adidas ankle socks but they stopped selling them/changed them .
 it was a very sad day .
 i just buy silly socks that all sorta match .
  mix and match socks .
 just to add to that all socks are not created equal !
 spend a little extra and buy quality socks .
 some are really expensive like so you got it figure out when they are on sale
 i thought i was the only one that did this .
 my husband and kids make fun of me but i honestly wouldn’t have it any other way .
 one gets a hole ,  throw it out and move on .
 no worries about finding the mate and getting rid of the pair .
 no matching socks when doing laundry .
 no worrying about wearing two different socks at the same time (sorry ,  my ocd won’t let me do this) .
 this makes my life so much easier !
 my wife said we needed a new vacuum and made the mistake of sending me out to get one .
 i love my new shop vac .
 live in an apartment and this is our vac for everything .
 carpet ,  vinal ,  bathroom ,  car .
 i &apos;ll use the blowing side to inflatable air mattres or coals for bbq .
 edit added punctuation for clarification .
 many of them can also reverse and with a nozzle attachment (or a funnel and duct tape) inflate pools ,  air mattresses ,  float tubes etc .
 what &apos;s a shop vac and how it is different from any other  &apos;vac &apos; ?
 my dads biggest regret
 i &apos;ve been thinking about this but have no clue where to start
 similarly ,  a fire extinguisher
 yeah my silver lining is such a good song .
 buying it on vinyl for $25 will change your life .
 there is a difference between a first aid boo-boo kit and a true trauma kit .
  most peoples home first aid kits are not set up for something like a hiking accident ,  car accident ,  severe trauma .
  a boo-boo kit fixes knicks and dings ,  a trauma kit keeps you alive until you can get advanced help .
  for those wondering what you need .
 march:  massive hemorrhage ,  airway ,  respiration ,  circulation ,  hypothermia .
  most regular folks can &apos;t do a ton about respiration or circulation but they can impact massive hemorrhage ,  airway ,  and hypothermia !
 0)  get training .
  stop the bleed classes are often free .
  red cross classes are very cheap .
  the training is there ,  the biggest commitment a lot of the time is just that .
  you don &apos;t need to be an md/do/np/pa/rn/cpa to save a life .
  know your local laws about the care you can give (ie ,  can you give a stranger otc pain meds without opening yourself to liabilities ?
 1)  assess your threats .
 are you driving ,  then stuff for a car accident .
  are you a competitive shooter ,  then stuff to stop bleeding and plug holes .
  are you a hiker ,  then stuff to stabilize breaks and sprains .
 2)  build your base kit .
 stuff every kit should have .
 -tourniquet (cat gen 7 or softt-w are gold standards) for hemostatic control .
 -z fold-compressed gauze for wound packing .
 -rolled gauze ,  israeli bandage ,  or other pressure bandage for further bleeding control or securing would packs .
 -gloves (2-3 pairs at minimum) .
 -compressed space blanket .
 -booboo baggie (bandaids/tylenol/antihistamies/neosprin .
 general stuff for booboos vs  &apos;if i don &apos;t do something this person may not even get to the hospital &apos;) .
 -baby aspirin for cardiac issues (ie ,  heart attacks) .
 3) expand your kit for your threat dynamic .
 for puncture wounds/severe trauma or massive hemorrhaging consider adding celox/quick-clot/hemostatic agent infused gauze for further bleeding control ,  a secondary tourniquet ,  chest seals ,  extra compressed gauze ,  a decompression needle (only if you &apos;re trainer/certified ,  this is not standard care for the general population) .
 for falls/sprains consider adding wraps ,  different types of otc pain killers ,  if space allows a collapsible litter ,  and slings to immobilize appendages .
 if you have kids who are or you are allergic to something ,  an epi-pen is also not a bad idea to include .
 home first aid kits should also be able to control massive bleeding .
 a lot of accidents happen in the kitchen around knives .
 4) go get more training
 every indian family uses a pressure cooker .
 i can say with confidence 99% of indians use this .
 i can &apos;t imagine my life without a pressure cooker .
 it makes rice ,  meat ,  lentils ,  pulses ,  beans almost everything in less time .
 just make sure you don &apos;t decide to buy any diy supplies while you buy the cooker ,  you &apos;ll probably get put on a list .
 i can’t believe i had to scroll this far down to find this one .
 we bought a pressure cooker last year ,  and i use it multiple times a week .
 when my grandfather was sick ,  it was multiple times a day .
 i’ve made so many whole chickens and bottles of chicken bone broth ,  and it’s so easy to do .
 i surround my desk with them so i &apos;ve got something to look at while i &apos;m waiting for stuff at work .
 it &apos;s very satisfying to watch them grow over time and i also think that being near plants is something that &apos;s psychologically good for humans on a very primeval level .
 i used to be sceptical about this but at the start of quarantine i decided to get a bonsai tree (my first plant) as i thought they &apos;re neat and saw they &apos;re not as expensive as i thought .
 having my own little window ledge forest is so lovely and having the trees looking  &apos;happy &apos; rewards me with nice warm feeling .
 it &apos;s sort of meditative pruning them too .
 i did a bit of research before i bought mine ,  but aren &apos;t as difficult to care for as you might think .
 i have been collecting house plants since covid started and i am in love with them all !
 unless you have cats .
 having children grow up in a house with plants decreases their risk of seasonal allergies .
 same with having cats/dogs/things that shed .
 first time i used one it was a girl &apos;s house and she let me use it .
 as it popped my back loudly it also pushed out a really loud fart .
 she looked at me like i just murdered someone .
 a lacrosse ball as well !
 get them glutes people !
 i never knew i could pop so much more of my back .
 as a uk citizen ,  a kettle is on a par with actually having food in the house .
 holy shit ,  just got up this morning and it &apos;s all gone mental !
 thanks for the award !
 as someone from australia it blew my mind how virtually no households have an electric kettle .
 that stuff is default in au .
 stovetop kettles are loud as hell ,  require your imminent attention ,  and occupy a stove quadrant .
 electric are quiet ,  generally safer to hold and handle ,  retain the heat for literal hours afterwards .
 first thing i did when i moved into my new apartment in la was made my landlord get me an electric kettle lol .
 although i have never been in an accident before knock on wood ,  the peace of mind that it gives me to know that i have backup evidence or anything of that sort for future issues is calming .
 best 50 bucks spent in the last 30 days .
 i &apos;ve had one for a few years .
 finally paid off when a guy backed into me at full throttle while we were waiting at a red light .
 without it ,  i &apos;m sure i would have been blamed for rear-ending him .
 my mom had a dash cam in her van for years ,  when she got into a really bad accident with a 18 wheeler we where able to use that to our advantage
 bonus points for a detachable showerhead and extra double bonus points if you are a lady who enjoys that particular brand of flying solo .
 my primary skill is sql and pulling data .
 yes i have degrees ,  but i don &apos;t really use any of that shit .
 moving data is a skill that makes you a god in the business world .
 i whole-heartedly agree .
 outside of cheaper options like udemy ,  the sheer volume of free resources available to people who have access to the internet is just amazing ,  but most people won &apos;t take the time to learn a new skill with these resources .
 shhhh don &apos;t let people figure out that sql (and development in general) isn &apos;t magic .
 i feel like i only get paid what i do because everyone just assumes it &apos;s too hard .
 i got a great knife at the outlet mall for $52 and a 12 &apos; cast iron pan on sale for $32 .
 that leaves me $16 for ingredients for fajitas .
 having plenty of counterspace is a part of this as well though ,  if you have a small kitchen ,  consider investing in a couple of taller ,  sturdy tables to prepare food on .
 it will make your life much easier .
 also get a large cutting board .
 once you &apos;ve found a board you think is big enough ,  get one a little bit bigger ,  it really makes cutting/cooking much more enjoyable .
 for anyone thinking of upgrading their kitchen knife (which you definitely should if you’re still using that dull ,  $20 bullshit you bought at ross 4 years ago) go to amazon and search “victornox 8” chef knife” then you buy a 1000 grit whetstone for around $20 ,  a cheap honing rod and watch a few youtube videos on how to sharpen your knives and keep them safe .
 also a magnetic knife rack which will run you about $15 .
 all of these things together will improve your cooking at home 1000% and you’ll spend far less time hunched over that onion with a dull steak knife looking like a fool .
 hmmm ,  should i stay inside and lay down ?
  or shall i go outside and lay down ?
 where from ,  the hammock hut on third ?
 i &apos;ve been using one for years so i don &apos;t even remember how big the difference was ,  but recently i convinced my bf to buy himself one and he was like  &apos;wtf my teeth never fealt so .
 just got one a few days ago .
 you are correct .
 i wish a good second hand instrument was less than 100 bucks :((
 not for americans atm
 or an old school home ec textbook .
 found one at a thrift shop and it’s from the early 60s and it’s awesome .
 it’ll teach just plain old home cooking ,  but also includes stuff i’ve never seen in other cookbooks .
 for example ,  how to time everything so it all comes out at once ,  a chapter on cooking for the ill ,  and there’s also a dated chapter on losing or gaming weight .
 budgeting is also a big part ,  as well as just planning tasty ,  balanced meals .
 i didn &apos;t take home ec and my parents &apos; didn &apos;t encourage me to help with cooking at home ,  so i was pretty damn clueless when i got my first apartment .
 my husband could do ham and cheese sandwiches in the microwave and that &apos;s it ,  so no help there .
 the main cookbook that taught me to cook is a usda book given out to people on welfare in the 70s called  &apos;cooking for two &apos; .
 i got it from a used book store ,  orange ,  crappy paper ,  and it was a lifesaver .
 you don &apos;t know how to cook and b .
 your budget for food is garbage .
 it emphasized cooking from scratch because they knew you couldn &apos;t afford the packaged mixes .
 i still use so many of the recipes today .
 funny thing happened when i was tellimg my mil .
 she was listening to me describe the recipes ,  went over to her cookbooks - and pulled out the exact same book .
 she &apos;d cooked from it when my husband was a kid - no wonder he liked my cooking .
 even without the delivery rate ,  plenty of good stuff are out of that range
 this comment was such a roller coaster i am seriously considering buying one .
 the box that my bidet came in had glowing user reviews on it .
 one of them said something like ,   &apos;whenever i go to work and i have to wipe like a peasant ,  it makes me really sad .
  &apos; i thought it was funny when i first read it ,  but i &apos;ve actually had that experience now and it turns out the box was right .
 piggybacking onto this to very ,  very strongly urge everyone considering a bidet to .
 b) spring for hot water hookup .
 only part b if practical .
 yes ,  cold water is absolutely sufficient ,  and not nearly as bad/shocking as some might fear .
 the hot water ,  while entirely unnecessary ,  is absolutely luxurious ,  and your ass deserves it .
 do ladies love your clean asshole ,  or do they love using your bidet to get a clean asshole ?
 we &apos;ve bought 2-3 kindle fires on prime days since amazon started doing it ,  mostly for our kids .
  the hd8 is a hell of a little tablet for $60
 my mom laughed at me when i bought a rice cooker .
 now she &apos;s a believer !
 ok ,  i’ve bought the twilight series and all of sean hannity’s books .
 let’s get to work
 once you get older these are less life changing as you will probably still have to wear glasses .
 a good knife and sharpener can completely change your cooking habits .
 many reviewers ,  like america &apos;s test kitchen ,  consistently recommend the victorinox fibrox chef &apos;s knife  for around $40 .
 a big cutting board is life changing in the kitchen .
 people really underestimate the logarithmic affect food can have on your life .
 a couple years ago i was mainly eating fast food and feeling like shit .
 started cooking a bit on my own ,  and now i feel the best i &apos;ve ever felt .
 strongly urge everyone to invest in cooking skills ,  and by proxy ,  the cookware necessary to be successful
 one of the male marketed products that is superior though is men &apos;s razors .
 i know women that swear by men &apos;s razors ,  both because they &apos;re higher quality and lower in price .
 female marketed products are vastly superior in so many ways .
 pink razors are terrible .
 also skin products are awesome and really helps .
 i went to a shop and found someone to help me pick out the correct stuff for my type of skin .
 i love their (love beauty planet) detox body wash i can literally feel my muscles relaxing from the scent and the cooling sensation .
 been waiting for flights to open so when i visit the states again i can pick up a whole carton amount of it lol
 how do you start using it though ?
 just every day keep trying and eventually i might be able to get there ?
 i have exactly zero upper body strength so getting started feels so daunting
 have you seen japanese toilets ?
 bidets are cool and all ,  makes everywhere clean but japanese bidets are for the win .
 every toilet is a bidet if you push yourself hard enough .
 do they really work as well as advertised ?
 no frills but really is excellent
 the good ones work just as well for men too .
 fuck google for pushing youtube premium so hard .
 they’re so aggressive about it that i’ll never even consider getting it out of spite .
 what’s the biggest benefit of mechanical vs standard ?
 i used to do drugs .
 still do ,  but i used to too
 you’re not wrong
 hey i get your vibe ,  but good limited slip differentials are a bit more than $100
 this made me laugh ,  i was just talking about heeleys with my uni friends the other day .
 the amount that have never had a pair was so upsetting .
 how much do you want for it ?
 after reading this ,  i wish i had testicles just to experience this particular feeling 
 wouldn &apos;t any headphones accomplish that though ?
 i just really like peeing on sticks .
 every shower head is a detachable one if you are strong enough .
 even a kids step stool does the trick
 i am grandfathered into spotify premium & hulu for $10/month .
 i feel like a god .
 being able to download and have albums and podcasts on the go is so nice .
 i don &apos;t have unlimited data so being able to do that makes my walks and drives so much nicer .
 i wish someone would answer this - i can only guess that it &apos;s the same concept as a straight one .
 except there is room kind of by the upper part of your body and the curtain is still tucked into the tub like normal ?
 i have no idea ,  trying to make guesses here .
 there &apos;s never enough monitors .
 or boil the water .
  pretty sure that was part of the instruction with my neti pot .
  and salt as well .
 i snorted a giant ,  black ,  hairy spider through my sinuses .
 he was nestled into the tube .
 i filled my pre-washed squeezy thing with warm water and salt and did my usual .
 it came out in the sink .
 i couldn’t talk about it for years .
 hello fellow non-morning person .
 i have one of these ,  it doesn &apos;t help me that much .
 it might work for you though !
 if i pull the covers completely over myself the boogeyman can’t find me .
 the vagus nerve wraps around the eyes ,  among many other places (it &apos;s uuuuuuge) .
 gentle pressure on it can activate the parasympathetic nervous response ,  which makes you calmer .
 decreases hr and bp ,  can decrease alertness ,  calm your stomach .
 edit for clarity: .
 what im talking about is the oculocardiac reflex .
 the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerves conect to the vagus nerve system through a nerve branch called the ciliary ganglion .
 you put gentle pressure on your eyes ,  the eye nerves communicate this to the vagus nerve ,  the vagus nerve activates the parasympathetic response ,  which produces a calming effect .
 edit pt 2:  /u/travmps says that its the symapthetic portion of the ciliary ganglia that produces this effect ,  not the vagus nerve ,  which is not actually in the face .
 fellow raccoon here .
 send help please .
 we bought a whetstone what feels like years ago and it went unused until last week .
 everyone in the household is constantly complaining about dull knives and i always tell them ,   &apos;well ,  we do have a whetstone ,  &apos; to which they respond  &apos;i don &apos;t know how to use that !
 eventually the dullness started to actually bother me so i spent 30 seconds watching a youtube video and gave it a crack .
 then i learned it had been bothering me my whole life and i just didn &apos;t know it .
 knives are supposed to cut that easily ?
 yeah but thats the stuff that keeps me up lol .
 my failures are expensive as hell and still live at home .
 how do you not pee all night ?
 i force myself to stop water intake by 8:00 pm because i end up peeing twice a night even with my water curfew .
 yeah it’s definitely more insulating .
 if your room is cool ,  or it’s winter ,  it’s hard to beat the sleep it provides .
 i’m an insomniac and it doesn’t “cure” it ,  but it helps for sure .
 relatedly ,  a dimmer switch for the bathroom .
  works in the middle of the night ,  as well as early mornings ,  as you can gradually increase the brightness to match your current tolerance for the world .
 our landlord isn &apos;t letting me talk to you ,  but it &apos;s important we do .
 such a crazy moment of reddit history lol
 make sure you leave yourself a post-it note about that .
 this guy ratchets .
 combine it with a wake up light alarm clock !
 oh man ,  did my life change when i got my buckwheat pillow .
 i tried using the standard pillows but could never find one that was comfy .
 memory foam got to hot or would compress to a pancake .
 getting used to the noise took like a week or so ,  but after that ,  pure bliss .
 i asked myself the same question when i read this reply !
 i &apos;ve bought dozens of pillows spending thousands total .
 i tried both purple pillows ,  the my pillow ,  bamboo pillows ,  soft pillows ,  hard pillows ,  foam pillows ,  memory foam pillows ,  weird gel like pilllows that are supposed to keep you cool at night .
 honestly the absolutely best ones (for me) are the belagio pillows .
 you can get a 2 pack at sams club for like $20 .
 i own 10 of them and last year for christmas bought them for family and all of them say they are the best pillows they &apos;ve ever had .
 some may ask why i &apos;ve tried so many pillows ,  i injured my right shoulder upper back and neck like 10 years ago and it has good days and bad days ,  the right pillow ensures more good days .
 i make a little nest of pillows around my upper body to ensure that i don &apos;t end up in weird positions .
 my neck ,  my back .
  both of them have pain like that .
 i am german irish and had a skin graph on my temple ,  and removal of a lymph node on my chest .
 my wife convinced me to go .
 turns out that i should have been going to the dermatologist the whole time .
 she saved my life .
 i would have waited it would have went from to lymph nodes to my brain and / or my lungs and that would have been end of story .
 if my wife did not insist i would not be here right now .
 so ,  i get to experience 2020 .
 in all seriousness ,  i may not be here .
 listen to your wife .
 the end result is  i cannot spend  more than an hour a day in the sun .
 i need to wear long sleeves and long pants and a ton of sunscreen even for a short time in the sun .
 what is my motivation ?
 i get to piss off all the people that thought i should be dead .
 screw you ,  i am staying alive to spite you .
 the only downside is my beautiful wife slaps on a ton of sunscreen everytime i leave the house .
 i guess living well us the best revenge .
 update note 1: wow ,  thank you for all the kind messages ,  and yes i am doing well .
 and yes ,  i do know my wife is awesome .
 you all are awesome for all the support .
 update note 2: to clarify ,  the surgeries were covered my my insurance with a copay .
 the reason i say this was less than a $100 is the advice from my wife was free and the copay for the dermatologist was $10 .
 i just want to say ,  the injection may feel like the worst part because after that the nerves are anesthetized .
 so ,  due to the anesthesia you don’t feel the scalpel cutting away flesh from your body .
 still sounds horrible !
 did you get it due to sun exposure/not wearing sunscreen ?
 or was it random genetic predisposition ?
 if you get a jump-starter ,  keep it charged .
 it becomes useless when you &apos;ve had in the back of the car for 9 months and it &apos;s gone flat .
 i’m a car detailer ,  and i have an air compressor for post wash drying .
 it’s really nice to shoot air into the tight crevices to blow the water out .
 it stops those annoying streaks below the mirrors and trunk lid that appear a few hours after washing ,  when the hidden water inevitably runs .
 you might consider a usb extender which comes in handy for other things as well .
 then you can just plug it into whatever .
 don &apos;t wanna sit at your desk for gaming ?
 now you can sit at the couch and use the coffee table instead of your desk and the tv instead of your monitor
 i once bought a 10 foot charging cable of god quality ,  unfortunately it was the god hephaestus and almost burned my apartment down .
 haven &apos;t had any problems with mine .
 it works as well as the charger that came with my phone and with that my phone &apos;s fully charged in like 20 minutes .
 it &apos;s literally just a $13 clothwrapped charging cable i bought at menards .
 ofc my phone has an insane battery tho
 did not know this thanks
 even if you are not a veteran ,  if you have a handicap placard along with the letter you take to your dmv it &apos;s free as well .
 california &apos;s national parks are amazing .
 (utah is great too though) the size of the trees  makes you feel like you &apos;re in a dream .
 although more expensive ,  decent active noise cancelling headphones change your life if you have to fly a lot .
 it doesn’t matter if you sit at the wing or not the amount of noise that gets blocked out is incredible .
 it drops the background noise by more than half easily .
 with minor hearing loss from too many concerts in my teens ,  20s ,  30s .
 i have active-noise-cancelling ear buds that i wear inside my bose noise cancelling headphones .
 for when i want to cancel the world twice .
 yeah adidas socks are the shit
 what &apos;s the difference between a shop vac and a vacuum ?
 i &apos;ve not heard of the former before and google isn &apos;t helping clear it up
 you have a bathroom car  ?
 fancy pants here .
 it &apos;s a heavy duty vacuum that you can use on liquids ,  and most have reversible suction so you can use it as a blower too .
 i highly recommend cerave .
 they use good quality ingredients ,  and they’re not expensive .
 their products are easy to find at wal-mart ,  target ,  or most pharmacies .
 i use their foaming cleanser ,  eye cream ,  and face lotion .
 for the face lotion ,  i actually use their “pm face lotion” every day .
 it’s nice and light .
 the one that says “daytime” on the bottle has spf but feels kinda greasy and thick to me .
 for the body ,  their moisturizing cream (the one in the tub) is amazing .
 for spf ,  my dermatologist recommended a mineral spf formula from neutrogena .
 it creates an actual physical barrier that protects the skin from sun damage .
 the bottle i use is white and yellow on the outside and says “dry formula” which is nice because you don’t get that greasy feeling like you do from some sunblocks .
 if you want to go an extra step or two ,  i like the ordinary !
 their products are so affordable ,  and good quality .
 you can order on their website online or at ulta .
 they have a glycolic acid daily toner that is has been a godsend for my skin .
 i also like their vitamin c and their niacinamide serums - they work to brighten and even your skin tone ,  and reduce acne breakouts .
 they have some awesome retinol products (which helps reduce the effects of sun damage and aging on the skin) ,  but they’re so popular that they’re often sold out:-( that being said ,  cerave just came out with a retinol product and i hear it’s good .
 so my daily routine looks like this: .
 glycolic acid toner .
 vitamin c serum .
 it may look like a lot of steps ,  but it doesn’t take long and i really have noticed a big difference in my skin since i started this routine .
 cleanser ,  toner ,  moisturizer .
 pick those depending on your skin type .
 doing more than that is for when you know what &apos;s good for you already .
 if you go outside ,  sunscreen .
 please ,  regardless of ethnicity ,  use it .
 it wont heal you ,  but is the reason you wont have cloggy skin in 10 years .
 by sunscreen ,  i mean for both face and body
 my dad was a firefighter .
  when my wife and i bought our first house my dad gave us 6 fire extinguishers ,  a box of 9 volts ,  and a life ladder .
  man i miss that guy !
 keep on keeping on .
 indian pressure cookers are very uncomplicated though .
 which is what i like .
 no fancy manometers ,  no timers ,  just basic weights for pressure release and stove top use .
 if i had them near my desk i &apos;d probably end up slowly pulling them apart cause i fidget with everything in reach
 a lacrosse ball cured my sciatica .
 as an irish citizen ,  i &apos;m pretty sure our right to a kettle is explicitly stated in our constitution .
 if a hotel room in the uk doesn &apos;t have a kettle and cups ,  it &apos;s a garbage hotel room and i hate it .
 or maybe some sweet internet points down the road from catching some happenstance situation .
 remember all them rad meteorite videos from russia because everyone had a dashcam ?
 no doubt ,  whoever is behind a vehicle ,  and somehow hits the back of another vehicle -  unless you have complete total confirmation and visual proof ,  you will always be found at fault .
 which is why the current situation i’m in is so stupid .
 the woman switched lanes right on top of me ,  and i had no room and very little time to even throw on the brakes .
 and i just hadn’t gotten the dash cam up yet .
 life is stupid like that sometimes .
 i was reading this and i was thinking if it’s detachable how the fuck does the water get to it ?
 i realised on reading further and thinking rationally that this is pretty much the standard shower head on a hose that we get in the uk .
 didn’t realise fixed shower heads were the standard elsewhere
 +1 for a detachable showerhead .
 i don &apos;t enjoy masturbating that way ,  but i do like being able to clean with a directed stream of water on my private bits because leftover soap gets itchy down there .
 squeaky-clean b-hole: a+
  some of us boys don’t need a co-pilot either .
 lockdown has been a blessing for me because i finally had the time to start learning python !
 i mean ,  isn &apos;t it basically the same for most of the jobs ?
 some people find fixing cars easy .
 some people find it easy doing accounting .
 and you can make alot of fajitas for that price .
 this is an accurate representation of my activities during the pandemic .
 really thinking about bringing my computer so i can lay in my hammock in the park and watch tv
 yes ,  the hammock district .
 this is why ive used a electric toothbrush for 4 years
 any of you want to drop some model recommendations ?
 i &apos;m reading and upvoting you all ,  i just can &apos;t reply to everyone ,  thanks for the feedback .
 what would probably be good to know is if there &apos;s good knock off heads available for your toothbrush as well .
  i don &apos;t mind paying 100 for the brush ,  but some of the official replacement heads are pricey !
 i got a shitty used saxophone for $400 .
 if instruments were under 100 ,  society would be amazing
 the part about timing things sounds super helpful !
 for example ,  how to time everything so it all comes out at once .
 black magic ,  i assume ?
 because i &apos;m 34 and i &apos;ll be fucked if anyone on earth can time a baked potato to be done at the same time as anything .
 i can &apos;t even always get them to be done at the same time as eachother .
 the joy of cooking will even walk you through skinning a squirrel .
  it is complete .
 i got one on amazon for $20 and it literally saves my asshole .
 i used to bleed from every shit ,  now it takes two wipes
 it is the only downside to a bidet ,  pooping anywhere without one just feels terrible .
 i agree with part (a) ,  but i went without the hot water version because it was going to be too far away ,  and i have zero regrets .
 the cool water works just fine .
 i like the paperwhite .
 no beckoning distractions -- it &apos;s just your books -- and it &apos;s easier on the eyes at night .
 but if you want an actual tablet ,  you &apos;re right that the fire is pretty good at that price .
 still knowledge ,  useless knowledge .

 women &apos;s razors suck !
 depends on the area; men &apos;s razors are better for armpits and bikini ,  since they &apos;re made for thick wiry hairs and awkward folds of skin .
 women &apos;s razors are better for legs still because they &apos;re made for a smoother surface and moisturize as you go ,  which is why some male swimmers and wrestlers i know use them for their arms ,  chest ,  legs ,  etc .
 begin with negative reps .
 stand on a chair or stool .
 and get in pullup position from the standing position ,  or jump up to a pullup position where your chin is above the bar .
 then slowly lower yourself down .
 continue to do these .
 even better ,  use a resistance band to help spring you during the rep .
 start with stronger or multiple bands .
 progressively reduce the resistance .
 eventually you will be able to do body weight pull ups .
 then comes the fun part when you add weight !
 chin ups are also usually easier for most people .
 but negative reps or using a resistance bands ,  ideally both ,  are a surefire way to progressively overload your way into being able to do them .
 japanese anus cleaning technology is incredible

 i just use my ps4 controller
 don’t you wana try it free for 30 days ?
 maybe later then .
 try youtube premium ?
 and it seems like there are way more ads now .
 it depends where you are .
 in the san francisco bay area ,  it is juice of the gods ,  we drank straight from the tap .
 in other places ,  it might give you long-term health problems .
 i &apos;m in philadelphia now and everyone has a brita filter .
 depends ,  a lot of states like adding a log of caco (aka caliche ,  scale ,  hard water) which is disgusting ,  but it will coat the inside of lead pipes ,  which makes unsafe water pipes safe without spending money to remove the lead pipes .
 it will also coat any surface that has water running through it and it &apos;s a pain to clean .
 you need some serious water filters to clean it up
 i bought one for home and didn’t notice much of a difference ,  but when had to use my non-mechanical office keyboard it felt like garbage .
 the keys feel so much less mushy on a mechanical keyboard .

 mowing the lawn or doing any yard work is 100x better with wireless buds .
 not having to yank the buds out and put them back in every time i leave my desk at work .
 being able to charge my iphone while listening to music .
 running and working out is less of a hassle .
 it seems like  such a small detail but i could never go back to wired headphones .
 the stool goes in the potty .
 you don &apos;t want to step on it .

 luckily i just mooch of my father for the no commercials and i let my friends use my hulu account .

 when i started dating my now wife i introduced to the concept of sharpening knives and she had no idea that it was supposed to be easy to cut veggies and fruit !
 that &apos;s why you have to drink first
 you need a nice water bottle and a good size pee jar for your nightstand .
 try not to confuse them .
 that might not be good in my case then ,  i have no ac ,  so it &apos;s like 80 degrees in my room at night .
 tolerance for the world ,  you say ?
 can it remove light ?
 i feel happy i recognize this
 had to make up for the whole boston bomber mess
 i’m out of the loop can you help :( .
 thanks y’all haha
 kakkerlak is a legend
 of course he is ,  he’s just sleeping a little longer than usual
 block the sun ,  then emulate its rise .
 the future is here ,  people .
 we got just partial blackout curtains and i &apos;m thinking we need some kind of light based alarm clock .
 also a new mattress .
 oh ,  i didn’t even consider the noise .
 the crunching would probably drive me nuts
 i entered into my relationship with my wife ,  who only ever bought cheap 5 .
 00 pillows from walmart ,  with a quality/expensive pillow .
  she swore up and down she &apos;d never buy one .
 eventually said pillow migrated over to her side of the bed and was the one and only time in 8 years of marriage that she &apos;s admitted to being wrong .
 mine has a button on it that allows me to check the charge .
 every time i am in my trunk i check it .
 the quality of a lot of these usb extender cables is total shit though so watch out .
 i find my stuff charges significantly slower with the bargain basement cables i &apos;ve bought over the years .
 he’s not used to working with cables .
 give him a break
 i bought a zeus quality cable ,  it ended up having sex with everything in the house .
 i have a bose pair and i &apos;m dead to the world with those on
 shop vac can suck up anything whether solid ,  liquid ,  a mixture of the two .
 they can’t be beat overall .
 try vacuuming up broken glass and beer with a hoover or dyson and you’ll maybe be able to do it once .
 i mean any car can be a bathroom car .
 yeah ,  i’ve always wondered why these haven’t blown up yet .
 but there &apos;s so much marketing its basically impossible to get any real info on the web .
 every site explaining scin care are promotional sites :(
 i want to add that toners aren’t necessary .
 any benefit you can get from a hydrating toner or one targeted toward acne you can find in a moisturizer or serum/leave on product .
 i can only imagine the pride on his face as he relishes in the “of course you did” look on your face .
 sounds like a great guy and a better father ,  i hope he’s resting easy .
 i keep a lego bucket near my desk for this specific reason .
 until i met my (australian) wife i had no idea this was something i needed .
 we moved back to the us from australia and a kettle was one of the first things we picked up .
 im not going to lie ,  when i was installing it that thought also went through my head haha ,  i dont have many points so i would be banking on that lol
 damn yall dont got wireless water in the uk ?
 i need to install my detachable shower head at the new house we moved to .
 my husband and i are in a disagreement about it .
 i like being able to fully clean where the sun don &apos;t shine ,  but he feels like the water pressure decreases when it &apos;s installed .
 so i have to find a better ,  but more expensive ,  one that we can both be happy with .
 the hardest thing i &apos;ve had to do with sql is migrating data between databases .
 say your company buys a new software to do x and they want to transfer all the data from their old system to the new one .
 but the new system stores data differently than your old system .
 so you have to do all kinds of crazy shit to massage the data into the right shape using only the limited features of sql .
 sql without the underlying understanding of relational database structure and design is limited .
 the language itself is pretty easy .
  being able to properly understand the data is more complicated .
  i recommend finding a good book or course on relational database design .
 not with the amount of cheese and sour cream i put on fajitas .
 what &apos;s the point then ?
 i &apos;m using a non-electric and all it takes is 2 minutes .
 bleeding is not normal .
 yea ,  switching from sandpaper to a bidet will do that
 but how are you supposed to feel independent and empowered without your pink razor ?
 mitchum unscented is the only kind i use .
 it &apos;s superior by leaps and bounds to others .
  i have been teased by roommates and friends for using men &apos;s deodorant .
  then they try it and are converted .
 their old slogan was  &apos;so effective ,  you can skip a day &apos; .
 it &apos;s still true .
 i &apos;m a big fan of resistance bands ,  i actually got to my first pull up using one (and obviously a good programme ,  too) .
 and you can scale up or down ,  depending ,  even if you can do an unassisted pull up or a chin up already .
 when you get tired and don &apos;t want to sacrifice technique ,  you can just use a thin one and carry on .
 to me ,  as a girl with the typical upper body strength disadvantage ,  this was my biggest fitness victory ever .
 it &apos;s like the holy grail ,  really .
 pro tip from a friend who’s a pro kick-boxer .
 that’ll buildup your body’s pull-up muscles .
 then graduate to 2 leg assisted then 1 leg assisted pull-ups .
 you’ll be carved in no time .
 you can &apos;t expect me to put the eels in if my ass is dirty can you ?
 i &apos;m mad about all the periods i had sans bidet .
 what was i doing with my life ?
 this apply for the seat retrofits too ?
 amazon returns don &apos;t go back on the shelf ,  they get sold in bulk .
 i &apos;m guessing a third-party vendor is to blame .
 bro you just had me over to game wtf
 they even shuttle around the buttons hoping some will mis-tap and give up
  mechanical keyboard at home ,  non-mechanical in the office .
  you can really feel the difference .
  don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call it life changing ,  though .

 you can make a cheap at home version with dried beans ,  rice ,  and a sock .
 fill most of sock with dried matter ,  leave a lil space at the top so you can move stuff around inside .
 sure ,  not as fancy but the mechanism is the same .

 can’t verify health benefits but it can very soothing and calming while falling asleep which is enough to at least try .
 no matter the knife my wife would always just use pressure to cut things .
 she was amazed how i was able to cut tomatoes and bread without destroying them .
 “let the knife do the cutting”
 it &apos;s quite legendary .
 ah the good ole days .
 that was so embarrassing
 someone made a post on reddit asking legal advice against his landlord saying he was breaking inside his appartment and would leave post it notes everywhere .
 it was pretty creepy and weird but someone in the comments suggested he might have a co gas leak in his appartment making him high without him realising .
 op bought a co detector and turns out he really had a leak .
 he would walk around his appartment high like a zombie and would stick post it all over his furnitures and not remember about it because of the memory loss .
 he would have died eventually if it wasnt for that redditor who answered in the comments
 perhaps a lot longer
 this is how i feel when i put foundation all over my face to get rid of the redness ,  then apply blush on top of that to put redness where i want it .
 they &apos;re not for everybody .
 if you &apos;re the kind of person that likes to switch positions in the middle of the night ,  you have to wake up ,  readjust the pillow ,  and then go back to sleep .
 you are literally sleeping on a sack of grain .
 great if you are the kind of person that sleeps like the dead ,  though .
 so what pillow do you have  ?
 that makes me wonder; what &apos;s the downside ?
 it sounds so good that there &apos;s just no reason to buy a regular decent vacuum ,  as they &apos;re hardly much cheaper .
 but it &apos;s a vinyl bathroom car
 thanks internet stranger !
  i really appreciate that .
 look and see if it has a water efficient restriction in the attachment point .
 pop out that little white plastic bit ,  hooray instant pressure improvement .
 two things: most detachable shower heads have a stream selector knob ,  so you can still get the full force from up top if you need it ,  and usually you can pop open the shower head and remove the little low-flow restrictor cartridge for life-changing water pressure .
 that is what i am doing right now .
 it is not just moving the data ,  you have to know how the data is used in both systems .
 and you have to figure out business processes .
 it is complex and includes human skills to talk to people and understand what they do every day
 i think this is the first time i’ve got caught off-guard by a comment ,  this made me burst out in laughter
 this message brought to you by bidetusa
 i’ll feel more empowered with a closer shave on my legs and crotch
 i respect your professionalism
 i &apos;m mad about all the periods i had sans bidet .
 similar ,  i &apos;m mad about all the diarrhea/large bms i had pre-bidet .
 sshhh don &apos;t tell everyone

 having a mechanical keyboard in an office environment is definitely a dick move .
 the tragic thing about being clean is the person doesn’t have the same tolerance .
  they try and use the same amount that they’re used to and it kills them .

 i swear to god i have read this exact chain of comments before the last time this type of thread came up .
 i feel like each of these points in the discussion on buckwheat pillows is exactly the same .
 because you &apos;re supposed to sit in it .
 they are bulkier and are probably harder to do routine carpet cleaning with since all you have is a hose and whatever attachments you want to put on it .
 they &apos;re not really upright or nearly as mobile with attachments that are much narrower .
 traditional vacuums are much better at cleaning up large areas of flat space like carpets or hardwood .
 stuff like this is why i keep coming back to reddit .
 just a wholesome moment between two strangers .
 rip to your pops ,  he sounds like a great man .
 i did that hooray ,  my drain can &apos;t keep up with the shower head !
 honestly i cleaned the drain recently ,   not much came up since i &apos;m already using a tub shroom .
  could i have a obstruction further down the line than my zip it can reach ?
 i &apos;m either gonna fix it or break it .
  &apos;no more bloody mess !
 i specifically asked you if you stuck it up your ass and you said no !
 (can someone enlighten me ?
 never be ashame of a price for something you spent a third of your life in/on .
 a good mattress/pillow can change everything .
 hell everything related to sleep is very important and worth investing into .
 why is it in a car ,  but on a bus/plane/boat ?
  &apos;my toilet water no longer looks like the tide at omaha beach !
 you didn &apos;t say anything about taint and balls .
 someone made a reddit post believing their landlord might be invading their home .
 someone suggested they may be under carbon monoxide poisoning .
 turns out that was the case and op’s life was saved
 and good shoes too .
 the other day this guy i know was complaining about his feet hurting so i told him to get some of the shoes that i wear .
 he asked ya but how much did you pay for those ?
 which was 200 bucks .
 he proudly said his were 29 .
 so i said remind me again who has feet that hurt ?
 whenever i watch saving private ryan ,  i &apos;ll be thinking about your asshole .
 thanks for the reminder to sign off the internet sometimes
 jesus christ i did ask about the taint and balls !
  its all on the text message bryan
 just like the thing with the bed bugs .
 reddit is crazy af sometimes
 the fuck is going on here ?
 what thing with the bedbugs ?
 i &apos;m a physician .
  eye doctor specifically .
  i will tell you that the longer i work (now 15 years) ,  my standard for the  &apos;average &apos; person continues to decline .
  case in point: thanks to the awful information filtering out there ,  i had a patient just last week who read that vitamin d helps you resist a coronavirus infection .
  well ,  he had also read that you can get more vitamin d by getting more sun .
  so he wanted to  &apos;collect &apos; as much light as possible with his eyes .
  as a result ,  he stared at the sun for a solid 60 seconds and burned holes directly into his retinas permanently reducing his vision with no chance at future improvement .
 one guy i met said that english is the true language of god because the bible is written in english .
 i used to work in travel and the amount of people that did not understand the following was staggering: .
 \- you cannot take a 3-7 round trip night cruise from miami to australia (and no ,  your friend did not just book this) .
 \- no ,  there are in fact no ocean bound cruises leaving from arizona .
 \- you cannot take a cruise from miami to hawaii and back in 7-10 days .
 \-no ,  the airport is closed due to hurricane/flood/ice and you cannot demand a flight on a different carrier out of the same airport in the next hour (also no ,  you did not just see someone book this) .
 \- yes ,  it is a shorter flight for your friends from east coast us to the caribbean than you in europe and no ,  nobody can change that .
 \- yes ,  i will need your dd 214 to confirm a military rate ,  no your word you  &apos;were in a covert unit &apos; will not suffice and no ,  i am not disrespecting the military because i cannot simply take your word for it .
 \-yes ,  if a passport/visa/travel vaccinations are needed for you to travel you will need it and no a manager cannot override this as it is a government requirement .
 i have been doing this for 6 years and no your friend &apos;s neighbor &apos;s hairdresser &apos;s roommate &apos;s cousin &apos;s mailman does not know more about this than i do .
 okay; so my favorite was a guy who was planning his honeymoon but he didn &apos;t have a lot of money .
 he was bummed about the cost of air travel .
 a friend suggested a train ride m8ght be cheaper .
 he became frustrated after a few days of trying and complained that he couldn &apos;t find any trains going to .
 it still didn &apos;t sink in because he had seen pictures of trains in hawai &apos;i .
 he couldn &apos;t grasp that they were shipped there .
 it got even more surreal after that .

 our app would text our users every morning with a greeting in a different language ,  i .

 one day we got blown up by a user saying their account was hacked .
 she said ,   &apos;my name is kim smith ,  not kim konnichiwa ,  someone &apos;s hacked my account !
  &apos; when we explained that our service has been clearly saying hello to her in other languages every day and that konnichiwa is hello in japanese and her account was fine ,  she went on a racist rant and said disney was behind the destruction of america .
 i just had a customer yell at me for putting their eggs in a separate bag ,  saying they don’t want all those bags and the paper ones always rip .
 before putting it in the bag and throwing a pound of flour on top .

 i once owned a smartcar and some stranger approached me at a gas station about why i didn &apos;t have a  &apos;slow vehicle &apos; sign in the back of it  &apos; .
 since all moped-cars must have that !
 i tried explaining that it was a real car - just a bit smaller - but he didn &apos;t take it .
 according to him i was driving illegally and he was surprised the police hadn &apos;t stopped me yet on the highway .

 i used to manage a retail store that sold teen clothing ,  so as expected ,  i primarily had teens working for me .
 one employee came to the back room while i was on break and asked what i was eating .
 somehow the topic turned to how i should’ve brought chicken for lunch because she wanted chicken .
 i told her i was vegetarian and therefore don’t eat meat .
 she tells me chicken is not meat .
 it’s “poultry” ,  and vegetarians can eat poultry ?
 she said at the grocery store the aisles list “meat” and “poultry” separately so they’re obviously different .
 we argued for a couple of minutes before i finally told her to go back to the sales floor .
  she didn’t last at the job long ,  but damn .

 a former coworker was talking about how she wanted to go back to school to get her masters &apos; degree because she only had a  &apos;bachelorette &apos; degree and wanted more job opportunities .
 i said ,   &apos;do you mean a bachelor &apos;s degree ?
  &apos; she insisted it was pronounced bachelorette when it was given to a woman .
 then she led me back to her office and pointed at her diploma ,  to the word baccalaureate ,  and said ,   &apos;see ?

 when i was in high school ,  we were reading a short story about what would have happened if the japanese attacked us back with nuclear weapons after hiroshima and nagasaki .
 a girl in my class raised her hand and said something along the lines of “why does this matter ?
 none of it is real any way” .
 the teacher had to ask her to clarify ,  but this girl thought wwii and the bombing of japan were just from a movie and didn’t actually happen .
 the best part is: the girl was half japanese .
 wow thank you for al of the upvotes !
 i have a ton more stories about this girl ,  so maybe i’ll post some on a different subreddit soon !
 worked at a larger grocery chain whose deli used scales that would show you digitally the weight so 1 & 1/2 lbs would show 1 .
 50 lbs on the scale etc  .
 the person i worked (f35yrs) had to ask me to come over and tell her how much she had sliced everytime she assisted someone for over 4 months .
 she had passed the written and verbal test they give to verify that you should be able to do this .
 she didnt seem to have problems reading any other signs or numbers so i dont think dyslexia played a part but man it was so frustrating trying to do my job and hers .
  i once had a lady call me from home because she couldn &apos;t get connected to her vpn .
  i asked her if she was connected to her home wireless network .
  she replied saying that she did not have home wireless .
  i then asked how she was connecting to the internet .
  her reply was  &apos;i &apos;m using the cell tower .
  i can see it from my house .
 while this is technically possible with a hotspot or cellular card in your pc ,  this isn &apos;t what she meant .
  she thought she could get internet service via wifi from the cell tower .
 when farms have trouble producing their crops ,  and you ask some dipshit if that worries them:  &apos;i don &apos;t get my food from a farm ,  i get it from wal-mart .
 one of my nieces had a cold as a toddler and was breathing through her mouth .
 my ex bil flipped out because he didn &apos;t want her to get carbon monoxide poisoning from breathing through her mouth instead of her nose (the  &apos;normal &apos; way) .
 i’m an insurance claims adjuster .
 if you truly knew how many stupid drivers you’re sharing the road with ,  you’d never drive again .
 edit because i keep getting this question: i avoid driving whenever possible .
 i have a car ,  but i take the bus to/from work .
 i never drive at night .
 on 9/11 the general manager called his daughter who was attending asu to wake her up and make sure she saw what was going on .
  the customer service manager said .
  &apos;it won &apos;t be on her tv yet ,  arizona is 2 hours behind us &apos; .
 i work at a restaurant .
 we were low on tomatoes for our tomato soup ,  so one person grabbed potatoes to see if we could use those instead .
 i worked at little caesars and we were proofing the dough for pizza .
 my boss said (at 7pm) that the dough needed to rise for 12 hours ,  and took out her calculator to do the math .
 so i said ummm that &apos;s gonna be 7am .
 then she said the dough will expire in 48 hours and started doing the math again .
 i told her it would expire two days from now ,  and she said  &apos;that &apos;s kinda weird how that works out huh ?
 i quit shortly after that .
 not necessarily the exact thing you &apos;re looking for ,  but when i was in high school i once had a friend come up to me bragging about his psat .
 i recognized immediately that he got a pretty poor score .
 when i mentioned to him that i didn &apos;t think it was a very good score ,  he confidently proclaimed:  .
  &apos;but it says i &apos;m smarter than 15% of juniors ,  and i &apos;m only a sophomore !
 to which i rebutted:  .
  &apos;yeah ,  but imagine the dumbest 15% of people .
 that &apos;s not very good .
 i had a friend once who truly believed that magicians like chriss angel and david blaine had some kind of magical power or telekinesis ,  something along those lines .
 while watching one of those magicians on tv performing on the street he argued  .
  &apos;how could this be fake ?
 look at all those people .
 cant fake all that .
 has to be some kind of power or magic .
 i would then have to ask do you realize that movies are fake ?
 they fake entire universes ,  planets ,  cities ,  war ,  etc .
 he didn &apos;t get what i was getting at .
 i once was working at a renaissance festival in south florida .
 i was just barely 21- had gone down there for the winter to help out a musician friend ,  and was living a very frugal lifestyle .
 i don &apos;t think i even had a debit card at that point ,  and my cell phone was pay-per-text at like $ .
 so anyway- i would totally get paid for booth-sitting for some artists after the weekend- but by friday ,  i was pretty broke .
 i had about $7 in gold dollar coins- because that &apos;s what i liked to keep on me at faire to give out as change .
 i had the remains of the $20 i &apos;d taken in coins ,  and other than that ,  i didnt have any other cash .
 we had a kid &apos;s day at faire- where schools bring kids on school trips ,  and so i needed to grab some food and get back to deerfield beach park .
 so fully dressed in renaissance garb ,  i ran into the taco bell .
  i figured my cash would go the farthest there .
  i ordered my food ,  and when i went to pay ,  the girl behind the counter laughs and goes;  .
 i need real money .
 i looked at her ,  confused .
  &apos;these are real money ,  they are gold sacajawea dollars .
  &apos;yeah ,  we only take us cash here .
 i need actual money to pay for the food .
 now the line behind me is getting antsy- but the girl at the register is getting really bitchy and i &apos;m like - what the fuck do you do when a business wont take your payment .
 it wasn &apos;t like i was trying to pay in nickels .
 -- worth of food and tried giving her $5 in coins .
 i &apos;m like ,   &apos;this is all i &apos;ve got on me .
 i don &apos;t know what to tell you- but it is legal us tender- see right here ?
  &apos; and i &apos;m trying to show her the coins- and shes yelling like im trying to pay her in monopoly money .
 the guy behind me was like  &apos;yeah ,  those are real coins &apos;- but i don &apos;t think he wanted her ire turned towards him- so he wasn &apos;t very forceful .
 i asked if she could get a manager and she was like ,   &apos;i ain &apos;t gonna waste his time with this bullshit .
 you either pay in real money ,  or leave &apos; and she &apos;s grabbed my bag of food so i can &apos;t go anywhere .
 i take out my wallet- remembering the two lucky $2 bills i had carried for years- folded up in the back pocket .
 i unfolded those- and she takes one look at the $2 bills .
 and i &apos;m sure you can predict what happened .
 next thing i know- she &apos;s screaming for the staff to call the cops and telling me not to go anywhere because i &apos;m trying to rip her off and pass off all this  &apos;fake money &apos; and she  &apos;gon see my ass to jail !
  &apos; - meanwhile ,  i &apos;m hungry ,  tired ,  and now very very irritated- and that &apos;s when a cop car pulls up .
 they weren &apos;t responding to the call- i don &apos;t even know if the store had called .
 i was ready to walk out ,  nearly in tears - when the two cops come in and all eyes turn to them .
 there &apos;s about ten people now in line behind me- and everyone turns to look at the cops who very clearly have a  &apos;wtf is going on- i just stopped to get food &apos; look on thier faces .
 that &apos;s when the obnoxious register girl ,  and two co-workers she called over- start waving my money around (that was the best part- she took my money and was refusing to give it back or to give me my food)- and the cops go to the counter to figure out what she &apos;s freaking out over .
 at this point ,  the manager heard the commotion and joins the two guys and the register girl .
 the three teenager employees are all going on and on about  &apos;the girl in the costume trying to give them fake money tryna rip them off &apos;- and the cops very quickly put an end to that .
 the one cop holds up the two $2 bills ,  and my gold dollar coins- and he tells the staff that both are- indeed- actual real money .
 the girl is still protesting- saying &apos;yeah but it &apos;s not america money and we only take america money .
  &apos;- when the manager finally realized what happened and apologized- telling the teenagers - who look to be completely in disbelief - that yes ,  the coins and bills are both really ,  united states money .
 the manager offers to personally remake my meal- and the cops as well - apologizing for everything .
 i &apos;m really late at this point ,  and i didn &apos;t really trust them to make my food ,  even if the manager was being really nice- but the cop said &apos;i tell you what- i &apos;ll come back and get your info while you make our food .
 how about that ?
  &apos; - so he accompanied the manager back white he washed his hands and made our food .
 the other cop gave me my money back ,  and took my info .
 as i was finally leaving with my food- the guy behind me jokes with the cop  &apos;i think i &apos;m going to pay with a handful of half-dollars i &apos;ve got in my car .
 what do you think ?
 i was so floored that anyone could be so ignorant .
 and not just ignorant ,  but completely and utterly unwilling to realize or to recognize that they had made a mistake and were wrong .
 all she did was double down- insisting we were all wrong and i was just a thief .
 infantryman was told to trim the hedges .
 so he lifted the lawnmower .
 his buddy started it .
 as a brand new medic ,  i spent about 6 hours pulling fingermeat from the hedges .
 thanks for the award .
 update: sorry ,  i &apos;m a redderp and on a phone .
 for clarification ,  it was early 2004 after oif1 in the 82nd .
 i was a pfc with only a year and a half in service .
 we bandaged him ,  then used tourniquet (temporarily) .
 senior medics took him to the er .
 i was field sanitation qualified ,  so i was left in charge of cleanup .
 6 hours was excessive ,  but after we pulled most the meat and bone out ,  we had to hose down the hedges ,  the ground ,  the grass he bled in ,  the ground/floor outside and inside where he left a decent amount of blood had to be rinsed and sterilized .
 the mower had to be rinsed and cleaned .
 it had some damage from the drop .
 the private that started the mower had to be smoked by his nco .
 we finished in about 4 hours of actual work with 2 hours of fucking off mixed in ,  cause the sham shield is the real deal .
 at a work christmas party in a mexican restaurant ,  an irish colleague was trying to argue the pronunciation of  &apos;jalapenos &apos; with the mexican waitress was  &apos;ja-la-pen-nose &apos; .
 he wasn &apos;t joking and got so upset with her  &apos;taking the piss out of him &apos; that he made a scene and we almost got thrown out .
 in grade ten ,  we had a science test ,  and the teacher gave one point for putting a date on the paper ,  and one point for your name on the paper .
 and then there were 98 points for the rest of the test .
  a guy sitting in front of me got 0 .
 didnt write the date and only wrote his first name .
 just scroll down a webpage or facebook feed and have a look at the ads .
  things like “only 2% can solve this puzzle” shit like that .
  those ads get posted so much because they actually work on a lot of people .
 one of my closest friends .
 really good guy but well .
 i’m learning spanish and i once told him i was reading this don quijote book .
 i complained about how difficult it was because it was written in 1605 .
 and he said “wait .
 spanish existed back then ?
 i was doing a covid decon of a medical supply warehouse that had a confirmed positive employee not too long ago and while my team was inside doing our thing ,  the floor/shift manager was following us around without a mask or gloves or really any of the proper ppe except for a high-vis vest and steel toe boots .
 i had to tell her to leave the room i was fogging with virucide .
 meanwhile ,  we were wearing full level c hazmat suits with p100 combo cartridge respirators and all seams taped up .
 that trick where you call water by a scary chemical name like dihydrogen monoxide so that people will want to regulate or ban it .
  &apos;so the iceberg was about the size of a .
  &apos;dont icebergs fall out of the sky &apos; .
 to this day i picure a iceberg the size of a small island falling from the sky being seen for hundreds of miles away like a fuckin meteor .
 i once got into an argument with someone over my own name .
 there are two pronunciations german and english .
 and they just couldnt accept the fact that i use the english pronunciation despite the fact that we were speaking english and it &apos;s what i &apos;ve used my whole life but nope i was lying to mess with them .
 knew a kid who drank bleach to prove it wouldn’t kill you .
 a week later he showed up at school after taking a shot .
 he said he “proved his point” when the teacher asked why he was bragging about it .
 mr hawk just said “but you cannot argue that without that medical treatment you’d have died though- you even said you have stomach damage and a burn esophagus yourself” .
 this kid was bragging about that .
 he was not mentally disabled or otherwise .
 he was just that kind of idiot .
 thank you all ,  who’d have thought my most upvoted comment would be about some kid i knew drinking literal bleach .
 the fact florida had to tell people not to shoot at the hurricane .
 people that cut holes in their masks  &apos;because it &apos;s easier to breathe .
 our town was live streaming a holiday parade in case you were not able to make it out in person .
 this included a live chat feature as well .
 one mother who lives nearby wrote into the chat that her daughter didn &apos;t get outside in time and asked for them to turn around and come back to her street .
 that people act supprised at the total death count going up .
 its always going to go up .
 if it was going down that &apos;s an entirely different pandemic altogether .
 my ex had a student ,  one who occasionally misspelled his own name ,  turn in a very well written essay that just so happened to be clearly printed off the internet ,  included the url at the bottom .
 he gave the kid a zero .
 kid &apos;s grandmother came in to the office completely distraught because she knows her grandson wrote that essay .
 he said he wrote it .
 when it was shown to her on the internet ,  she insisted that he must have written it and put it on that website himself .
 thank goodness the principal was a good one and let her know she didn &apos;t buy that for a minute .
 also ,  when i was a teller ,  i asked a man for id .
 he showed me his personalized belt buckle .
 when i said that wasn &apos;t enough ,  he offered to go get his sister from the car; she could tell me who he was .
 he didn &apos;t understand why neither of those would work .
  &apos;who else would wear a belt buckle with my name on it ?
 why would my sister lie to you ?
 she doesn &apos;t want any money .
 had someone argue with me because they where sure that the cavemen were before the dinosaurs and that it is impossible that dinosaurs even existed ,  she considers mammoth and sabertooth to be dinosaur .
 was sitting next to a girl who was notoriously dumb at our school .
 thought people were being too hard on her until she straight up asked google “who invented water ?
 a lot of people still believe blatant pseudo scientific facts for instance the blood being “blue” inside the body when it’s not introduced to the outside air .
 the fact that i’m a retail worker in 2020 and everyone thinks calling me a hero is gonna solve all my crippling financial struggles
 the average voter .
 churchill said it best:  &apos;the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter .
 i have a fraternal male twin (i am female) and in high school i had a girl ask if we were identical ,  i said “no he’s a dude” and she said “no i mean genetically are you identical ?
 ” and i just stared at her wondering if she skipped all of our science classes to not know the answer .
 myself ,  looking for my phone when it was in my hand all the time ,  then answering a call ,  and continuing looking for it during the call .
 thanks for the award and dayum ,  using glasses must suck sometimes
 the people who believe 5g is responsible for spreading the virus .
 seriously ,  i don &apos;t understand how electromagnetic signals could possibly distribute a biologically impactful virus .
 seriously ,  there &apos;s a new low every month/year .
 the comments section of any website
 the flat earther that tried to launch himself into fucking space and died
 on the man show they set up a booth on some pier (i think santa monica) and were getting women to sign up to end womans suffrage .
 tons of women were signing .
 obviously being the man show this was a joke on women but the reality is the amount of people in general who do not know suffrage is the right to vote and not some sort of suffering is far too high .
 stupid: i work for a company that has a bonus pay system ,  which is based on survey responses .
 stupider: i got a survey that marked everything a 1-2 (out of 10 ,  10 being highest) ,  as in i got bombed on this survey .
 but the survey includes an open comment field ,  where the customer &apos;s comment stated that the service was fantastic and everything was great .
 (clearly this indicates that they simply did the survey  &apos;upside down &apos; .
 stupidest: my district manager refused to invalidate the survey response .
 i didn &apos;t get my bonus for the quarter .
 i work with this one guy .
 he asked me about a daily deadline that had to be met ,  one that i designed .
 i told him the deadline time .
 he then proceeded to argue with me for fifteen minutes about how i was wrong and that it was actually an hour before that .
 i didn’t even know what to tell him .
 a man i worked with ,  23-25 years old was absolutely positive that the techrax video where he drills a hole in a iphone 7or8 (which ever was the first without a 3 .
 5mm jack) to make the headphone jack was 100% real ,  and they did it to hide it from customers and this was a hack to find it .
 this man also had to get a ride home when his car steering wheel wouldn &apos;t move because it was locked as most cars do and he played with it for an hour and was unable to unlock his wheel .
 he &apos;s a fucking mouth breather .
 one word to explain it &apos;s a steering wheel not a tire
 i had a patient overdose on heroin the other day .
  we got to the house and a friend at the house stated she poured milk down his throat thinking it reversed the effects of heroin .
 i was knocking doors in memphis ,  tennessee .
 not the nice part either ,  i told one of the residents i talked to i was from connecticut .
 she said ,   &apos;oh my when did we get a 51st state ?
  &apos; i then told people from that point on i was from the big apple .
 i was working in a gas station in a ski town during off season .
 this town was at the south gate grand tetons and yellowstone .
 a woman came in and slapped a dollar on the counter .
 in the most karen way she said: “i want change for a dollar .
 that’s four quarters !
 ”  “you’re kidding .
 i am from canada and our dollars have five quarters .
 thank you for sharing !
 ”  she lit up with pride ,  took her change and left .
 when italy was europe’s coronavirus epicentre ,  my supermarket sold out of all forms of canned tomatoes .
 except the ones with “italian” on the can .
 i just finished tutoring two intro to comp sci courses .
 lesson 1 in about defining variables .
 naturally ,  there &apos;s people that didn &apos;t know how to do that by the final .
 people learn at different rates .
 i get that ,  but how did you not learn lesson 1 after 15 weeks ,  20ish homework assignments ,  7 quizzes ,  and 2 previous exams ?
 people who think arabic numerals shouldn &apos;t be taught in schools
 rowling ,  the author of harry potter has had to argue the pronounciation of her own name .
 more than once .
 having explained and argued my own name i &apos;m convinced more than half are below average .
 i work at costco .
 i firmly believed the majority of people had common sense and were relatively intelligent .
 before i worked here .
 one example: we have the plastic shield up at the desk at the door for the whole covid thing for protection when checking receipts .
 people tried reaching around it so we had to write “receipts here” with arrows so they’d know where to put it .
 now they try putting it through the plastic like it’s a window
 a girl in my physics class asked if a suit made out of atoms would be invisible .
 i used to teach university students .
 the kids were 20-21 years old and in the second year of either molecular biology ,  biochemistry ,  or microbiology .
 when i handed back assignments i told them that they were alphabetized by last name .
 every week 90% of them would flip through the stack one-by-one whether their name was atkins or zanzibar .
 they didn &apos;t listen ,  they didn &apos;t learn .
 the people burning down 5g towers to prevent covid-19
 girl i know thought she was super smart for getting a 90 on an iq test because it was 90 out of 100  .
 another time i walked past two girls talking (in high school valley girl voices)  and one said it &apos;s amazing the olympics are going on this year ,  they only happen once every one hundred years .
 the others response was omg yea .
 when i was a sophomore in high school ,  a classmate asked to borrow a pen ,  and i lent him one of mine that had the eiffel tower on it .
 he asked where the building was from ,  and i said paris .
 he gave me a confused look and asked where paris was .
 was it further away than chicago ?
 now it was my turn to be confused .
 we were in high school ,  how the hell did he not know paris was in france ?
 but whatever ,  maybe he &apos;s not the brightest .
 so i inform him that paris is in france .
 but he still looks utterly confused .
 i assume he misheard me ,  so i started explaining it .
  &apos;france ,  you know ,  like ,  france .
 from history class ?
 world war ii ,  napoleon .
  &apos; he said he was bad at history ,  and had never heard of france before .
 he then asked me if it was another state ,  or was it like a region of our state .
 utterly baffled at this point ,  i tried to explain that it was another country entirely ,  and it was in europe .
 exasperated ,  i remember saying  &apos;you know ,  europe ?
 that other continent ?
  &apos; he still looked confused ,  so i added  &apos;the land across the ocean !
 finally ,  there is recognition on his face .
 he tells me he heard of oceans before ,  he thinks he understands now .
 i remind you that this encounter ,  with a student who didn &apos;t know what europe was ,  took place in high school .
 i had a 16-year-old new start ask me at work  &apos;was the world black and white before they invented colour tv &apos;s ?
 nice guy ,  dumb as a rock .
 i worked as a frontline tech support for a big internet provider .
 want an example ?
  &apos;my internet is hella choppy ,  i can &apos;t do anything &apos; .
 ok ,  can you describe what you mean by  &apos;choppy &apos; .
  &apos;the arrow thing jumps all over the place &apos; .
 make sure your mouse is clear of debris and on a smooth surface .
 i ain &apos;t got no mouse .
 what do i want a mouse for ?
 are you on a laptop ?
 i &apos;m on my internet !
 i just bough this internet computer thing ,  spent like 5 hours putting it together and it don &apos;t work !
 ok ,  the thing you are using to move the cursor ?
 that &apos;s the mouse .
 make sure its on a clean ,  smooth surface .
  &apos;wait ,  that &apos;s not a pedal ?
 i &apos;m supposed to use that with my hand ?
 i work for a cupcake shop that takes deliveries and this just happened today .
 a lady calls ,  pissed ,  saying the cupcakes she ordered for her brother never arrived .
 this is concerning because all the morning deliveries had been made !
 i frantically start texting the delivery driver about what happened ,  in case it went to the wrong place ,  but she swears up and down it was delivered with no problems to the recipient’s assistant since he wasn’t in the office at the time .
 i call the lady back ,  explaining this ,  and she tells me “oh that makes sense .
 he hadn’t asked if anything had come for him ,  so i’ll tell him to ask for his cupcakes .
 ” love when people jump to the worst conclusions about our staff instead of just telling their loved ones they have a delivery and should look around for it for more than two seconds .
 there &apos;s one i have that stands out for this question .
 i was at my job at the time ,  a buffet place that has decent prices considering they serve steak on the bar and you can get a lot of expensive product for about $17us per adult ,  and had a younger couple come in during the weekend .
 for context ,  the prices at this place were a bit higher during the weekend because that was when they would pull out the bigger stuff ,  like prime rib .
 they ask for two dinners and two drinks ,  so i punch them into the register ,  and tell them the price - after tax ,  maybe $35us or so .
 they look a little apprehensive at the price ,  and ask if they can think about it .
 well ,  there was no one else in the line waiting to eat in ,  so i say  &apos;sure !
 just let me get this gentleman &apos;s to go order while you do .
  &apos; they &apos;re fine with it .
 so i ring in the guy &apos;s to go order ,  and since the to go prices were determined by weight ,  if you got a reasonable amount of food for a human being getting to go was usually cheaper than dining in .
 so they hear that this guy pays maybe .
 or something in that area ,  and say  &apos;well ,  we &apos;ll just do a to go order because it &apos;s cheaper !
 so i tell them the process for getting a to go order in this place ,  and they go and start filling their containers .
 a while later ,  not exactly sure how much later off of the top of my head ,  they come back with like 5 or 6 fucking containers of food .
 i get them rung in and the price is at least $15-$20us more than if they had just paid and eaten in ,  and they came back the next day to get more .
 they paid at least $15us more every time they came in than they would if they had just eaten in and paid that fucking price for all the food !
 they really should &apos;ve done some damn math .
 here &apos;s my story .
 i apologize for the length ,  but it &apos;s worth it .
 years ago ,  i had to apply for some kind of government program .
 can &apos;t remember what .
 probably something to do with my kids &apos; health insurance .
 but that &apos;s immaterial .
 i had just closed the doors on a dismally failed business ,  which was why i was applying for the program .
 they had me fax all of my earnings and bookkeeping paperwork .
 most of which had zeroes or negative numbers on them .
 the person on the phone was looking at the papers i faxed them the day before .
 finally ,  the guy said ,   &apos;sir ,  i &apos;m going to go ahead and transfer you to our financial expert .
  &apos; he used that word .
  &apos; (remember that .
 after a brief 40-or-so minutes on hold ,  i was talking to the  &apos;financial expert .
  &apos; we went back and forth for a while and she was obviously confused af .
 (my paperwork was as simple and basic as you can imagine ,  mind you .
 like first-lesson-in-high-school-accounting simple) she sighed with frustration .
 you &apos;re frustrated ,  bitch ?
 after 20 minutes or so ,  she asks me ,   &apos;what does  &apos;sooo &apos; mean ?
 i gets confused .
 i look everywhere .
 the word  &apos;sooo &apos; is nowhere on the papers .
 i say ,   &apos;ma &apos;am ,  you &apos;re looking at an exact copy of the papers i &apos;m holding in front of me .
 the word  &apos;sooo &apos; isn &apos;t on any of these pages .
 well ,  to make a long story slightly less long ,  it took me another 10 minutes or so to realize that she ,  a supposed government agency  &apos;financial expert ,  &apos; was mistaking the numeric designation for no money ---  &apos;$0 .
 a financial fucking expert .
 that was the moment i realized that george carlin was being generous when he said ,   &apos;picture how stupid the average person is ,  then realize that half of them are even stupider than that .
 my facebook feed .
 i had to delete it .
 i was getting too angry at something i cannot change .
 watching someone wear a mask to the grocery store ,  then take it off so that she could sneeze into her hand .
 my stepdad thought aluminum foil is microwavable .
 the black spots in my microwave can validate .
 a girl i went to college with in kentucky thought the capital of kentucky was bluegrass .
 the people that bought all the toilet paper ,  leaving us normal people fucked in regards to how to wipe our asses .
 groups of people leaving their house to block the roads to a hospital because they &apos;re upset that they can &apos;t leave their house .
 i used to work at an ice cream shop and sold custard by the pint or the quart .
 people would ask for the pint ,  receive their order and say  &apos;oh no i wanted the big pint .
 my family is full of morons .
 the best one was when my cousin walked into work one day and i looked up and said  &apos;omg can you beleive they now put a limit on how many times you can breathe in a day &apos; .
 and her reply was something along the lines of  &apos;how am i supposed to do that ?
 also the time she thought the string attached to a balloon on a table was stiff and holding the balloon up .
 running out of fuel multiple times and calling to say shes  &apos;broken down &apos; .
 she has children .
 american voters were surveyed as to which they liked better ,  obamacare ,  or the affordable care act (aca) .
 the aca had drastically higher support .
 they are the same fucking thing .
 i used to work customer service for a bank ,  and that job seriously showed me how very very stupid people are .
 a very common one were the people who would call in with a question about their account ,  but they &apos;d refuse to give me literally any information about who they were (date of birth ,  numbers on the back of their card ,  address ,  etc) because i could be a scammer .
 like ok karen ,  you called us .
 i can &apos;t access your account unless i know who you are ,  so what do you expect me to do ?
 or the people who would call our bank about their account ,  despite not belonging to our bank and never having belonged to our bank ,  to ask a question about their account (which is with another bank) .
 those calls were awful ,  because i &apos;d spend ages trying to find their account and they &apos;d be getting angry like i &apos;m the incompetent one .
 then they &apos;d find their card somewhere while they &apos;re on the call and .

 like how the hell do you even make that mistake ?
 in the 80 &apos;s ,  a&w attempted to compete with mcdonald &apos;s  &apos;quarter-pounder &apos; burger by selling a  &apos;third-pounder &apos; for the same price .
 the operation failed tremendously ,  with virtually no one buying the burger .
 when they surveyed customers for an explanation ,  the majority of customers responded that they  &apos;didn &apos;t want to pay the same price for less meat .
 their customers genuinely believed that one third was less than one fourth and refused to try the new a&w burger because of it .
 obligatory  &apos;fuck everyone who says  &apos;rip my inbox &apos; i hate that shit &apos;
 i argued with my sister for half an hour that people in mexico speak spanish ,  and there was no such language as “mexican” .
 at the time i was in my second year of spanish class in school .
 my sister refused to believe me .

 had a client complain that his phone had been stolen from the swimming pool i work at .
 he claimed that someone broke into his locker ,  took his phone (not his car keys and wallet too) ,  and then locked it again .
 turns out he changed into swimming trunks ,  left his phone in his swimming trunk pockets and took his phone into the pool with him !

 i have an ex who refused to believe different people had different body temperatures .
 he would get annoyed if i was cold & he wasn’t as (apparently) it wasn’t possible
 ex-coworker one asked why we don’t we just use helicopters as a cheap way to go to space as they can go straight up into the air .
 when someone asked me if there was meat in beef barley soup .
 when i said yes ,  she responded i don’t eat meat ,  i’ll have a blt .
 ” my head almost exploded .
 honestly just look at the facebook comments that any news station publishes .
  i sometimes look at those comments and start getting annoyed and then i take a step back and think ,   &apos;u/masterofpuppets8986 why are you doing this to yourself ?
  &apos;can i get a medium pizza ?
  &apos;we actually only have large .
 let me get a small then .
 we only sell large pizzas .
 i &apos;ll go ahead and get the medium then .
 our large is the smallest we have .
 we have large ,  extra large ,  and 26 &apos; .
 we call it large for marketing purposes .
 edit 2: a lot of comments here are further proving the whole question of this post .
 new york style pizza is huge ,  by nature .
 this is awful but it is also hilarious .
 i am sorry if you had to explain to this person what they had done .
  on a similar note ,  my in laws are the sweetest people but very uneducated .
  they were babysitting my 1 and 3 year old during the last solar eclipse and before i left i asked them to not let the kids look at the eclipse because it can hurt their eyes .
  i mentioned it because i could see them thinking the eclipse was cool and showing the kids .
 instead they got all serious and said they &apos;d been watching the news and they keep saying how strong the sun will be during the eclipse so they had already decided to keep the blinds closed all day and not let the kids go near the windows because they were afraid they &apos;d get sunburns inside if the sun was going to be that strong .
 the amount of people who think jesus lived in the united states is astonishing .
 and then you have the people who think that saying  &apos;thee &apos; and  &apos;thou &apos; is holy language because that &apos;s the way the bible was written .
  no ,  that &apos;s the way english was spoken when the king james bible was translated from greek and aramaic .
 ok ,  just imagining a full-grown adult trying to convince you they were a super secret spy has me cracking up !
 but ,  but ,  my cousin &apos;s friend &apos;s neighbor &apos;s dog walker &apos;s ex-wife &apos;s boss &apos;s sister &apos;s professor &apos;s ta went to the airport once !
 or drove by an airport .
 or saw a picture of an airport ?
 anyway ,  you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about and my mom &apos;s friend &apos;s son &apos;s neighbor &apos;s plumber &apos;s cousin totally does !
 i had this argument with an ex girlfriend years ago when the walking dead was still relevant .
 one of the opening scenes to an episode had a character with an eye-patch looking into a mirror .
 she claimed the creators fucked up and had his eyepatch on the the wrong eye and then i had to explain how mirrors worked .
 she refused to walk into the bathroom so she could see my example ,  because she didn’t want to admit she was wrong .
 that &apos;s actually pretty funny if it wasn &apos;t so sad .
 i mean ,  its obviously fake if one thinks about it ,  but i could see someone taking just the right classes to make it that far without knowing the truth simply because it never came up
 i literally had to read this prompt five times because the idea that the water in a river would come around like a disneyworld ride was just so alien to my mind that the sentence was not computing .
 i had a girl ask me how the water got back up a waterfall to fall back down again .
 i mean how do you respond to that
 ok i have been unfortunately guilty of this one time .
 a new girl started at work and she sat across from me so we shared some desk space in the corner .
 she put these flowers there with a special vase that made it look like real water in the bottom .
 as a nice gesture i watered them for her before one weekend .
 she got a huge kick out of it ,  and we laughed about it all the time .
 that &apos;s the dumbest thing i &apos;ve read in this thread so far .
 i think i am not the only one who wants details here .
 on a related note ,  i think if i were to take up becoming a drag queen ,  i would seriously consider  &apos;kim konnichiwa &apos; as my drag name .
 or  &apos;karen konnichiwa &apos; and demand to speak to a lot of managers .
 i had a lady scold me because i placed a bag of potato chips on top of her egg carton .
 guess ,  she didn &apos;t notice that the egg cartons in the cooler were stacked about six high .
 i saw a guy im front of me at the dmv fail the eye test ,  and tell the employee he has glasses but they &apos;re at home .
 he got really mad when the employee told him he has to come back with the glasses and re-take it .
 i never understood why ,  but people at the dmv are just a different breed of stupid everytime i &apos;ve been
 sounds like this can be an entire ask reddit thread itself .
 i just had a patient call 911 from her er bed the other day .
 she wasn’t getting the pain meds she wanted .
 we had a lady call 911 recently complaining that it was raining which made the roads “too shiny” .
 are you literally asking us to control the weather .
  &apos;i found a sandwich in one of your parks ,  and i want to know ,  why it didn &apos;t have mayonnaise !
 i kept getting voicemails from some dude i didn &apos;t know ,  really angry shit like yelling at an ex or something .
 first time i actually answered i told him wrong number .
 several voicemails later and i answered again and said  &apos;i &apos;ve told you this is the wrong number ,  you need to stop calling me .
  &apos; his response was  &apos;you need to stop telling me what to do !
 my family has two electric cars and the sheer number of people who ask  &apos;yes but where do you put the gas ?
  &apos; after explaining that it runs on batteries is staggering .
 i think it &apos;s because they &apos;re still thinking  &apos;hybrid car &apos; rather than  &apos;all-electric car &apos; but even after a very thorough explanation they often still go back to  &apos;where &apos;s the gas go ?
 so many people are blind to the effects that outdoor cats have on birds .
 and even when you try to tell them they get pissed off and say you &apos;re exaggerating that they &apos;re cute buddy could never be so dangerous or detrimental
 wait ,  you should’ve brought chicken because she wanted some ?
 i recently spent 20 minutes on the phone with a board member ,  trying to diagnose why his camera wasn’t working for our online meetings .
 funny thing: you have to actually have a camera in order for it to work .
 that &apos;s fucking hilarious ,  in the saddest way possible .
 that sounds like a sick super power though
 wow that &apos;s like the nigerian prince scam version of picking up women - tell them something so dumb all the smart ones will run away
 if you told me this was true for bees in australia ,  i would totally believe you .
 the number of people who don &apos;t read menus at restaurants .
 spelling ,  because i think faster than my fingers can type .
 when working at a restaurant ,  i waited on a large party and gratuity was automatically added by the computer .
 after handing out the check ,  a few minutes later the guests comes to me looking very angry .
 “whatis this gravity charge ?
 why you chargin me for gravity ?
 man ,  this made me a little sad .
 people are so susceptible to marketing these days that they think just because something is called  &apos;diet &apos; it must be good for them .
 reminds me of my flatmate from uni who used to drink smart water before taking exams .
 man ,  i wish the air only came out of your nose .
 it &apos;d be a lot easier to clear the airways during a cold or allergy season .
 i don &apos;t know if this is satire or not ,  but good job
 at least they came in and asked .
 if they were genuinely trying to learn ,  that’s a point in their favor .
 who knows what kept them from learning it earlier ,  but hopefully you taught them without embarrassing them .
 4th grade special ed student starting to get into pre-algebra problems (eg .
 the student does fine in class ,  but comes in without homework being done .

 i genuinely thought that was about to be a yogi bear quote .
 ah man it’s true .

 i used to work in banff national park .
 one day at the end of the tour i was driving some guests back to their hotel and a woman was adamant that banff was clearly a very dangerous place to visit since we  &apos;just let wild animals run around everywhere !
 they should be in cages !
 had to fight the urge to throw her off the bus pretty hard .
 some other gems that came up in the past include a guests insisting he needed to change money they got in bc to alberta currency (not a real thing) .
 a man arrived very irate that the entire trans-canada highway was not lit with proper street lamps every 100 yards (that would be a stunning waste of energy ,  not to mention probably cost more than our national budget .
 and you car has lights on it !
 more than a few have grossly underestimated the distances involved in a country like canada .
 no ,  you cannot drive from calgary to toronto and back in the same day for lunch at the cn tower .
  &apos;see bro ,  just wait like 2 hours and take another photo of the same cash and deposit it again .
 and again and again .
  &apos;yeah bro ,  instant money .
  &apos;fuck we &apos;re gonna be so rich off this $84 .
 that &apos;s some big brain megamoney shit right there .
 was it zuckerberg ?
 do all those photos get a manual review ,  or only the ones it couldn &apos;t automatically detect the check information ?
 used to work at one of the big bank call centers .
 lady called screaming because our atm sucked up her card .
 it was a $50 target gift card .
 i asked why did she put a target gift card in our bank atm and she said  &apos;i wanted the cash instead .
 ah yes ,  rat terriers .
 must have been half dog and half rat .
 who are you who are so wise in the ways of science ?

 holy crap ,  i used to have a manager who tight the same thing !
 she also admitted to me once that she thought the majority of diseases were caused by actual ,  supernatural possession .
 the exchange i had with her over the animals thing was baffling .
 i had a co-worker ,  really sweet girl but dumb as shit ,  tell me she smoked american spirits because they were  &apos;non addictive ,  see ?
  &apos; as she showed me the box .
 that says no additives .
  &apos; such a  sweet ,  stupid girl .
 she was a good server ,  at least .
 what is a baccalaureate ?
 i have barbeque degree too !
 i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s stupid or just pure chaotic energy
 using the flashlight on your phone to find your phone in the dark .
 what i always wondered was ,  where do these people get their info from ?
 like ,  do they just make it up on the spot ?
 wow her mind must have been blown when she found out wwii happened
 similar situation for me .
 i was on a business trip with two colleagues back when band of brothers first came out .
 over dinner ,  colleague a mentions that he watched a moving episode the night before - the episode where the soldiers liberate dachau .
 a: it was really powerful ,  this episode when they liberated the concentration camp .
 a: the concentration camp .
 b: the what camp ?
 a: you know ,  where the nazis imprisoned and exterminated millions of people .
 b: oh my god ,  seriously ?
 why didn &apos;t somebody stop them ?
 a: somebody did ,  gina .
 it was called world war ii .
 i have never studied a caesar salad so intently .
 along the same line ,  my previous employer used a 100 minute clock for the time clock .
 this meant if you arrived in time ,  your punch would read 8:50 .
 the manager of the department assigned time keeping to another person ,  because he knew he didn’t understand it .
 after several weeks of everyone punching in at 8:50 ,  we all got called in for it .
 first of all ,  we were all salaried ,  except one person ,  so the time didn’t really matter in terms of the law .
 but it kept the peace ,  so no one complained .
 we all got ripped up one side and down the other ,  and no one was allowed to speak .
 not that any of them tried ,  except me .
 when the manager and the time keeper finally shut up ,  i pointed out that the clock runs on 100 minutes ,  not 60 ,  so therefore we were all on time ,  or early .
 they stood dumbfounded when they looked at the clock and it literally showed an analog clock with 100 minutes .
 so then i took it further to point out that as salaried employees ,  none of this matters ,  and that none of us ever left for much ,  giving them 9 hours instead of 8 .
 and that they walk in at 8:30 and we are already there ,  so how could we really be arriving at 8:50 ?
 they understood ,  and removed the stipulation that salaried employees need to use the time clock .
 well  ,  at least shes never heard of the  &apos;why did the chicken cross the road &apos; joke .
 she &apos;d call the fbi to deal with that sort of problem
 the distance that many people have from where their food comes from is shocking
 i had a roommate in college that legitimately didn’t know food came from sources other than a grocery store .
 i grew up in a town that has a significant number of apple orchards ,  so i was always bringing apple and apple-related products back to the apartment after visiting home ,  and she was genuinely confused as to why i’d buy apples there instead of waiting to get them when i got back .
 when my daughter was born ,  we had to see the hospital pediatrician before we could switch to our usual one .
 we &apos;re in a tiny exam room and he &apos;s going over the dos and don &apos;ts for new parents .
 to precede this ,  he &apos;s an older southern man .
  &apos;and i assume she will be sleeping in a crib in the nursery ?
  &apos;we have a bassinet set up beside the bed to make night feeding easier .
  &apos;she can &apos;t sleep with you !
  &apos;she won &apos;t be in the bed ,  she has a bassinet beside the bed .
  &apos;if she sleeps in the same room ,  there will be too much carbon dioxide and she &apos;ll suffocate .
 that &apos;s what causes sids .
 then isnt this exam room unsafe ?
 we put in a complaint with the practice and the hospital .
 that &apos;s some ridiculously incorrect information to be spouting off at people ,  especially parents who take everything a doctor says as gospel .
 i can &apos;t even find the logic in that .
 i read things like this and start asking myself ,  “why would anyone think this ?
 how would this even work ?
 and then i realize ,  this is the kind of stupid i don’t want to understand .
 i work in highway safety ,  can confirm .
 i can no longer count on two hands the number of people i’ve stopped with in the middle lane of traffic on a freeway ,  with no bigger problem than a flat tire .
 when i question them as to why they stopped in the middle of a freeway ,  the typical answer is either the vehicle wouldn’t go any further ,  or they don’t want to damage their rim .
 i swear to whatever you want me to swear to ,  people will put the well being of the rim on their car above their own safety and even the safety of their children .
 i worked in fnol (first notification of loss) claims ,  so i believe you and maybe why i don &apos;t drive .
 i &apos;ll always remember one guy .
 it was winter at night ,  he was going round a bend on a country road when it was icy in the arse-end of scotland .
 i asked ,  as part of the basic info  &apos;what speed were you going ?
 so in icy weather ,  on a blind country road at night you were going 60 ?
 do you fucking wonder why you span off the road ?
 and how you could have died ?
 i’m already scared now that our dumbass state (ga) has let thousands of teens get licenses without a fucking driving test .
 i’m prepared for i-75 to be so backed up .
 per another redditor ,  i discovered they reverted this sort of .
 they’ll have to take tests by september 30 .
 still ,  it’s 20k some odd people on the road who shouldn’t be which scares me until then .
 why didn’t australia warn us about 9/11 ?
 after all they are several hours ahead .
 well ,  don &apos;t keep us waiting .
 tomato/potato what &apos;s the difference .
 the most surprising thing here for me is that little caesars bakes fresh dough .
 sounds like she didn &apos;t know how to tell time .
 surprised she knew how to use a calculator .
 but there’s no 19pm ?
 how would that work .
 i worked at a pizza place and a few times sombody comes in and asks how many slices are in a large ?
 they say ,  okay ,  how many slices are in a medium ?
 10 ,  then proceed to watch their brains melt as they try to figure out how its possible ,  they come to the conclusion its not possible and argue
 right ,  i know it &apos;s fake ,  but i do enjoy trying to figure out how they did it .
 also it &apos;s just cool as shit what they can come up with especially in live performances .
 i had a similar situation only it was at arby &apos;s .
 the company i worked for at the time was handing out 2 dollar bills as rewards for random achievements ,  you know ,  for the novelty .
 so lunch time comes and i &apos;ve got a pocket full of 2 dollars bills .
 well you know how the rest of this goes except i was a little luckier than you .
 the guy behind me in line overheard and offered to buy all the 2 dollar bills i had .
  &apos;my kids will love them !
 holy shit that’s dumb
 i used to work in aircraft maintenance ,  there was a cage used for putting tyres inside when pumping them up (to protect people if a tyre burst due to the high pressures involved) .
 well ,  a story we always got told was of a trainee that was told to go pump a tyre up and was instructed: make sure you use the cage !
 low and behold ,  someone checked on him 5 mins later and there he was ,  squeezed inside the cage with the tyre half inflated
 jesus fucking christ
 the same happened to a mexican friend that ordered some guacamole in france .
 waiter kept trying to teach him to pronounce it “the right way” .
 that &apos;s fucking hilarious !
 reminds me of the time my classmate copied the test answers of my other smarter classmate in 2nd grade .
 he got caught because he copied the name too .
 sounds like he purposefully failed
 i guess she at some point she heard that if you love dolphins you shouldn &apos;t eat tuna and thought  &apos;tuna &apos; is what we call dolphin meat ,  like we call pig meat  &apos;pork &apos; or cow meat  &apos;beef .
 my fav if those  &apos;see what your fandom/whatever name is based on your date of birth/hometown/first and last letters of your mom &apos;s maiden name/etc .
 like you have a chart ,  and people post their results ,  and it &apos;s a goldmine for anyone looking for the answers to those pesky security questions lmao .
 ugh ,  these are the worst .
  &apos;only 5% of people are smart enough to get this right ,  can you ?
  &apos; and then it &apos;s usually some stupid grade school riddle that i &apos;ve known the answer to since i was 7 ,  or some  &apos;complicated &apos; math equation that any middle schooler who remembers pemdas could easily solve .
 i actually had people on my facebook who would share their results for these tests ,  like  &apos;omg look how smart i am ,  i knew the answer !
  &apos; i mean ,  sure ,  there are probably people who wouldn &apos;t be able to answer these ,  but it &apos;s definitely not 95% ,  and if you &apos;re dumb enough to actually believe that only 5% of the people who read that post can solve it ,  and feel like knowing the answer somehow gives you bragging rights ,  you &apos;re definitely not winning any intelligence awards .
 that &apos;s more ignorance than dumbness .
 although pretty high tier ignorance .
 i know someone who thought france was a city in italy .
 i had to double take because i thought they were kidding but i legitimately had to explain that they are different countries .
 i mean aside from maybe not paying attention in geography class ,  what about the olympics ,  world cup ,  etc .
 where there are different teams representing them .
 we were wearing full level c hazmat suits with p100 combo cartridge respirators and all seams taped up .
 should i be wearing this getup too ,  or is my mask and shitty gloves good enough to handle a small town &apos;s groceries ,  because that &apos;s my job .
 my local pool contains high quantities of a chemical used in industrial cleaning solutions ,  and is used to cool nuclear reactors .
 think of the children .
 i &apos;ve got two little girls who were born 15 months apart .
  they look pretty similar ,  and we get asked if they &apos;re twins pretty often .
  even though one is quite a bit taller ,  you &apos;d be forgiven for thinking they were fraternal twins .
 i once got into an argument with somebody over whether my daughters are twins or not .
  it wasn &apos;t until i pointed out that i was literally there ,  watching them being birthed ,  that they finally conceded .
 i have a twin sister ,  and my mom told us a story of us shopping at the store (we were in a double stroller) .
 a lady stopped to admire the babies and asked if they were identical .
 my mother said ,   &apos;no ,  they are fraternal .
 the lady responded ,   &apos;i &apos;m pretty sure they are identical !
 my mom replied ,   &apos;one is a boy ,  and one is a girl ,  they aren &apos;t identical twins &apos; .
 the lady huffed and said  &apos;well they look alike ,  they are twins !
  &apos; and stomped off .
 it makes me laugh to this day !
 i knew a girl in highschool who wanted to breath fire .
 she put lighter fluid in her mouth and instead of blowing it onto a flame ,  she lit it on fire inside her mouth and then tried to blow it out .
 she came to school the next day with a bandage over half her face .
 there were people in adana , turkey that shot at the sun because it was too hot
 when your only tool is a hammer ,  every problem looks like a nail .
 i &apos;ve seen countless people here on the news wearing the masks in such a way that only their mouths were covered .
 their noses are completely exposed .
 you might as well not be wearing a mask at all if you used them like that .
 ok wait there’s no way that’s actually real right ?
 that’s less dumb and more entitled
 lol ,  i hope the zombies follow social distancing
 i had to explain this one in excruciating detail to someone recently .
 and the fact that the change in the rate of it going up was more important .
 sounds like someone &apos;s been watching ice age instead of studying .
 churchill really said everything there was to be said didn’t he
 he also firmly believed that democracy was the worst idea man ever had but that it was better than the alternatives .
 he was also almost never entirely sober ,  or completely drunk .
 i don &apos;t think that &apos;s actually churchill - at least according to his website .
 his best regarding democracy (that i always remember) is: .
  &apos;democracy is the worst form of government ,  except for all those other forms that have been tried .
 i (male) have a fraternal female twin .
 i have had this question asked too many times to count .
 i always respond with “no ,  we are conjoined .
 ” more than half of the time ,  they believe me and i never correct them .
 me ,  on a call with my mom ,  getting ready to leave the house but spending 20 minutes freaking out that i can &apos;t find my phone .
 my mom ,  asking if i &apos;d checked my purse .
 i once used the flashlight on my phone to look for my phone under the couch .
 definitely felt like a dumbass for the rest of the day .
 as i understand that whole conspiracy theory (at least the start of it) ,  nobody thought 5g spread corona virus .
 they thought 5g was actually killing tens of thousands in its own way ,  and the corona virus was an attempt at a cover up .
 corona virus was either completely fabricated ,  or a fairly harmless new virus “they” used to carry the blame .
 they probably don &apos;t even realize viruses are biological .
 well ,  she wasn &apos;t wrong
 i had something similar happen recently .
 they had a list of lunch specials that were identical to regular menu items at the same price .
 i asked what made them special and the waitresses response was  &apos;nothing just the word special &apos; .
 excuse me ,  what’s the soup du jour ?
 it’s the soup of the day .
 mmm ,  that sounds good .
 i’ll have that .
 i feel that this could be put on a ballot ,  complete with social media campaigning ,  and women would lose the right to vote by a large margin .
 she probably played too much minecraft
 this might be genius on your part if the thought takes root .
 off the karen goes savoring this new nugget of truth and proudly sharing it with all that she comes across in the future whenever canada is brought up
 i have met people in college unable to read at a child &apos;s level .
 i was tutoring some kids and was shocked as hell ,  i could not figure out how they had the marks to get into the school in the first place .
 turns out they didn &apos;t get in based on their own merit ,  really pissed me off and opened my eyes .
 the kids i helped were good kids but they should be able to read better than my elementary school aged child ,  which of course they definitely could not .
 yeah ,  roman numbers are very practical to use in equations .
 what kind of terrorist nonsense is this !
 i have to say as a university student after about the 5th person to go through those the order becomes all messed up .
 my last name starts with an s and half the time it would be in a different place in the stack because people look for theirs and just shove the stack of papers back together in a different order .
 kids like that are proof that try as hard as we can to lead people to the “well” of knowledge ,  we can’t force them to drink .
 i thought that when i was 5
 obligatory calvin &apos;s dad comment
 i hope you confirmed ,  that yes ,  it was .
 maybe it was worth it to them if they could get 3 meals worth of food for the price of one more if they had left and come back for another ?
 that depends on how much they could eat in one sitting ,  obviously ,  but i can &apos;t eat much in a buffet setting so getting a take out box with a couple days of food in it may actually financially pan out to get a ton of take out by weight .
 especially at a buffet place where the takeout price doesn &apos;t seem like a scam ,  like yours did .
 of course i don &apos;t know these customers and i have no doubt people can be this stupid .
 groups of people outside the gym exercising on the street to protest that they can &apos;t exercise in the gym .
 this is how idiocracy  started
 tbf ,  if i received a survey asking me to compare the two ,  i &apos;d assume they were different even if i previously believed they were the same .
 i used to work at a burger /shake shack type place .
 often times people would read the menu at all and just open with “i’d like a cheeseburger” and naturally we’d ask “1/4 or 1/3 lb ?
 ” the amount / variety of people who just said “whichever’s bigger/smaller” astounded me .
 sounds like they had beef with fractions
 amateurs ,  they should have sold a 1/5th pounder for the same price ,  or only slightly less than a quarter pounder .
 there wasn &apos;t any real statistics or anything of the such .
 it was a statement by the ceo to save face; not the stupidity of people .
 i took my very first chemistry class when i was in the navy ,  age 22 .
 we were learning a bunch of chemical formulas ,  but the instructors assumed that we would know that they function as equations .
 for the first few weeks i was memorizing them by rote .
 one day i was like ,  “huh .
 there’s the same number of os on the left as on the right .
 ” then i noticed the hs were the same way .
 and then i laughed to keep from crying .
 overreaction is better in this case than underreaction
 i don &apos;t think anyone even acknowledges the fact that there &apos;s no way for jesus to be a blue eyed white guy either .
 oddly enough that happened on more than one occasion !
 genuinely not fake ,  i got the grade wrong though it was one step before college (in germany we have 3 levels of education + college ,  i thought college and university are different things so i guess i &apos;m not better lol) .
 i think it was one of those moments where she was told something as a child and then it never came up to correct her ,  she was really confused about why her answer was funny to the class
 i have pressed every single button ,  turned every tap and flicked every switch in my house at least a million times .
 how people can just stand in a shower and never try anything ,  especially if they don &apos;t have hot water ,  just blows my mind .
 didn &apos;t realize how much this had blown up while i went about my day ,  apologies for the delay .
 her reply was honestly just so  &apos;what the fuck ?
  &apos; that we all had a good laugh but it was one of those things we &apos;ll never forget when we look back at the early days .
 essentially ,  her first point to us was ,   &apos;this is america ,  we don &apos;t speak asian bullshit &apos; .
 funny that other languages didn &apos;t bother her .
 she had received several other messages in other languages prior according to the logs ,  apparently bonjour and guten tag don &apos;t trigger racists for some reason /s .
 from there ,  her attack on us was that we were worried about being too politically correct like the bastards at disney trying to cater to all races in their movies .
 i wish i had the ability to pull up the exact quotes ,  but alas it was 4 years ago and sadly i &apos;m no longer there .
 hope that helped with the burning questions ,  have a great weekend !
 because it’s a true sampling americans without any of the filtering that your lifestyle applies to the world around you .
 everyone has to go to the dmv ,  so the people you see there are an honest slice of what we’re actually working with .
 how do people this stupid make it into government positions like this ?
  i &apos;ve worked in comm centers in 2 states and can attest .
  if you ever wondered (for the sake of argument or whatever) if stupidity is relegated to certain regions .
  &apos;there is a sign on on of your water fountains that says don &apos;t drink the water ,  so i made sweet tea with it and now i have an infection .
 are you listening to me ?
 set an alarm so you can call him at odd hours of the night to tell him to stop calling you .
  eventually he should block you .
 i used to get these random texts from some dude looking for “jennifer .
 ” i would always respond that he had the wrong number ,  but he never believed me .
 eventually ,  it got annoying enough that i had to get to the bottom of it (he would text between 1 and 3 a .
 i started asking probing questions ,  and learned that jennifer was a stripper who ,  he thought ,  had given him her number one night .
 apparently ,  he had given her a few hundred dollars in exchange for a promise that she would meet up with him later .
 i even learned what she looked like and what club she worked at .
 my first thought was that i had a reason to go down to the strip club and find jennifer and tell her to stop giving my number to people (this dude wasn’t the only one who texted me ,  but he was the only one who wouldn’t believe i wasn’t jennifer) .
  i wasn’t keen on strip clubs at the time ,  so the next time he texted i had a different idea .
 i talked to the dude on the damned phone and tried to explain ,  but he thought i was just some guy friend answering her phone for her to get rid of him .
 you want to be stupid ?
 let’s see how stupid you can get .
 i told him via text to go down to the strip club and just bang really loudly on the back door and ask for me .
 that the security would let him in .
 i told him that if they play dumb ,  it’s because they’re supposed to in order to weed out the weirdos .
 i got no further texts from dudes looking for jennifer after that .
 i wonder if they put gas in their cell phones .
 i had an outdoor cat once that ate an entire squirrel .
 everything but the tail .
 she would frequently try to help herself to other employees lunches .
 like i said ,  she didn’t last long lol
 funny you mention this ,  i work in it as well and had an employee just last week complain that her speakers volume was too low .
 turns out she didn &apos;t have speakers and the sound was coming out of the tower under the desk .
 i used to work in tech support and 98% of my job was getting people connected so they could work from home and resetting passwords .
 especially on mondays ,  after the weekend and after holidays because everyone had forgotten them .
 then a bear eats the honey and it gets snake fangs and stingers on its claws .
 the circle of life is both gorgeous and terrifying .
 i have a nice extreme version of that frustration for you .
 worked at a very swanky ,  very expensive bar once upon a time .
 one of the featured cocktails that we were well known for was upwards of $500 .
 price was very clearly listed on the menu next to the cocktail .
 so was a description of the components involved ,  all of which were super high end and pricey af on their own ,  so anyone reading even just the description and somehow ignoring the clearly printed price next to it could extrapolate that the cocktail would be pricey just based on the ingredients involved .
 people would order it regularly enough that we kept it on the menu for about 5 years and sold a few a week .
 it was a draw for our “dine to impress” guests for business meetings ,  dates ,  etc .
 and a favourite of our wealthy regulars .
 one day a couple comes in .
 wife points to this cocktail on the menu ,  orders it by name .
 husband orders a drink we’ve also had on the menu for a few years (albeit his is nowhere near as expensive .
 his was around $30) while claiming it’s his favourite drink of any of the bars in the city ,  they come here all the time ,  he absolutely loves our bar ,  blah blah blah ,  ok great sir ,  drinks will be along shortly .
 go about my business and they’re fine the whole time and loving their cocktails .
 when their bill comes he flips .
 refused to pay for his wife’s drink .
 went on a tirade about how we’re scammers and we should be ashamed of ourselves and he’s going to expose us for bad business practice ,  all because management would not remove it from his bill and made him pay for it since she drank it .
 screamed at me ,  my manager ,  the bartender ,  anyone who would listen in an attempt to bully us into removing it from the bill .
 your wife used her own finger to point out the cocktail to me on the menu and read it off to me and asked for it by name .
 you also claimed to be suuuch great regulars ,  so by your own admission should be somewhat familiar with our menu since you have professed “favourite” drinks on it .
 he claimed it wasn’t her fault that she didn’t look at the price ,  and also that she didn’t know what any of the spirits were in the cocktail so how would she have known that it should be expensive ?
 never mind the fact that when she ordered ,  he asked what she was getting and she read it off to him & he was like “ohhhh ,  ______  ,  that’s a really nice liqueur ,  sounds great babe !
 he claimed it was my fault because per him ,  i should have asked if she was aware of the price to confirm if she actually meant to order the super expensive item she ordered .
 that i should have made her aware that this drink was x price before allowing her to proceed because “no one in their right mind would ever pay that much for a cocktail” (except as i already mentioned ,  many people did in fact pay that price quite regularly and were happy to do so) .
 he could not comprehend that in a place like this where we have wines well into the thousands of dollars per bottle range and cocktails at $30 on the low end of things ,  as well as a list of high-end spirits that cost on average $50-$300 per oz ,  it would be wildly inappropriate for me to ask every patron “are you sure you want/can afford that ?
 it’s x amount of dollars you know .
 ” that shit would not have flown with any of our clientele .
 it would have been ,  in our clientele’s lingo ,  “tres gauche .
 he learned a very important lesson the hard way that day .
 always look at the price of things if you are in a pricy establishment !
 hell ,  even in an average priced establishment .
 if you are concerned about cost ,  no matter if you’re in a denny’s or a michelin rated restaurant ,  check the damn price before you order something .
 as an example ,  i will never blindly order a glass of wine in any restaurant anywhere without first looking at the menu since prices can vary so wildly between places ,  glass size ,  etc .
 you can’t blindly order something ,  consume it ,  and then bitch about the cost after the fact .
 that responsibility is on you .
 this is silly ,  because obviously gratuity is a normal and common word and obviously different than gravity ,  but it just reminded me of the $10 “tourism fee” that was added on top of my already extra overpriced breakfast at ihop in niagara falls last fall .
 $10 just as a cherry on top for eating breakfast in a tourist town .
 fuck i’m still mad about it .
 during college i always carried around a smart water bottle and just used it as a refillable one ,  and anytime someone asked me about it i’d just say “how do you think i got in here ?
 the parent came to me after school ,  without their child ,  because they knew something was wrong and didn &apos;t want to look stupid in front of their kid .
 this is filed in my brain of parent reactions i can &apos;t fathom .
 along with the mom that year who asked if her child could play piano in marching band .
  &apos;you &apos;ve tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times !
 man ,  after baby proofing my kitchen getting things out of drawers is hands down the most difficult part of cooking now .
 and the baby still gets into shit that &apos;s baby proofed and kicks my ass like it &apos;s nothing
 i had a foreign exchange student from holland stay at my house in bc - i asked him what he wanted to see while in canada and he asked if we could go check out niagra falls one afternoon .
  crazy how some people just don &apos;t have a concept of how huge canada is ,  i think especially people from a country that you could drive across in 5 hours .
 no ,  you cannot drive from calgary to toronto and back in the same day for lunch at the cn tower .
 well ,  not legally ,  anyway .
 ( wow i wasn &apos;t expecting this much interest in my offhand joke .
 (i &apos;m actually planning to do this trip in a day with a dogsled team .
 just for the challenge ,  you understand .
 i picked up this old asian guy hitch hiking out of saskatchewan once .
  he barely spoke any english and kept asking me over and over  &apos;how many mile easter ?
 it took me a while to get out of him that he was going to newfoundland ,  i was going to nova scotia .
  so i started telling him  &apos;like 5 days &apos; ,  and he would act like he got it ,  but then a while later would start asking again .
  eventually i was like  &apos;5 sleeps &apos; and made a  &apos;hands are pillows &apos; motion and tilted my head and closed my eyes .
 oh he got it then .
  he fell asleep and woke up as i driving through winnipeg and demanded to be let out .
  last time i saw him .
 you mean our $168 bucks ?
  &apos;wait ,  they might see they &apos;re the same serial numbers .
 let &apos;s just take a picture of the backs this time .
  &apos;you &apos;re a genius .
 you mean chihuahuas ?

 whenever you &apos;ve got a problem ,  throw a molotov cocktail and then you &apos;ve got a different problem .
  &apos;hold on a sec ,  i can &apos;t find my ph .
  &apos; then i realise that i am talking at the phone .
 wait until she hears about wwi
 how does this even happen ?
 like ,  how do people go through their lives and the school system and just never learn basic history events like this ?
 what is the point of at 100 minute time clock ?
 i used to work at glacier ,  we kept books full of dumb shit tourists would say ,  and we wrote in them every day .
 i &apos;ve worked in touristy areas in new england and the tourists there are all very same-y: lots of upper-class people ,  mostly white ,  mostly from ct/ny/nj ,  who live surprisingly insulated lives ,  few people are super nice or memorable ,  and few are really all that horrible .
 all fairly intelligent -- at least ,  intelligent enough to work office jobs and drive a leased $80k car to make them look wealthier than they actually are .
 working at a national park .
 you meet some of the most terrible ,  horrifying people (unimaginably dumb ,  violent ,  sometimes both); more often ,  you meet scores of the most wonderful people ,  and they come from all over the world .
 very stressful but usually very rewarding work .
  &apos;train your animals better !
 anyone can sound intellectual .
 that specific bit might be ,  but my uncle is a dispatcher for 911 .
 he &apos;s collected a books worth of stoopid callers .
 one of my favorites is a woman called because one duckling wasn &apos;t being treated nice by the others .
 yes ,  she believed that the police could stop duckling bullying .
 or there was a woman that locked her keys in her car ,  pretty common .
 responding officer arrives ,  takes a walk around the vehicle ,  leans in through an open window ,  and unlocks the car .
 the distance that many people have from their brain is shocking
 not only this but also co-sleeping in the same room is shown to reduce the incidence of sids .

 i used to try and educate people like this ,  then i realized it &apos;s like playing chess with a pigeon .
 they &apos;ll just shit all over the board and strut around like they &apos;ve won regardless .
 and the weird thing is ,  it makes perfect sense to them .
 there was a lady a few years in chicago that stopped her car in the middle of the expressway for some reason .
  we dont know why ,  because she ,  and her two sons were killed in the ensuing accident .
 i was once driving on a completely pitch-black 4:00 am trip to the airport in the middle lane of a country freeway .
 i suddenly became aware of an all-black f150 truck completely abandoned in the left lane right as i was passing it .
 no lights ,  no blinkers .
 just a dead truck in the fast lane that i probably would have hit at 70mph if i had happened to be in the left lane .
 i don &apos;t know the circumstances of why it was there .
 maybe someone had trouble and got a buddy to pick him up .
 but unless the axles completely seized in place why on earth would you not roll it out of the lane before you leave it there ?
 reminds me of a facebook post that went: “just found out china is like 12 hours in front of us of us !
 why didn’t they tell us about 9/11 ?
 fuck china 3 billion people died” .
 not verbatim but close .
 and actually bothers with a long leavening time .
 bc you cannot buy dough as cheaply as you can make it .
 and as an added bonus; bread dough is about as simple as it gets .
 and you see ,  little ceasars is a successful pizza biz .

 you could have tricked her into paying you double for working half the hours .
 i saw penn and teller live and my favorite trick was where teller was putting a few coins from his hand into a fish tank ,  and goldfish appeared .

 the dad of an old friend of mine shattered his entire lower leg after putting his foot on a quad tyre he was inflating .
 shredded the muscles ,  bone completely unrepairable ,  launched him across the room and split his head open off the floor hard enough to knock him out for 16 hours and require getting broken bits of skull removed so they didn &apos;t damage his brain .
 and that was just a quad tyre .
 old physics teacher told us about how a friend of his grew up on a ranch in australia ,  they used to put water in the combine harvester tyres for traction in the dusty ground .
 five years old he watched a guy not pay attention to pressure while taking to his friend ,  big boom ,  head goes sailing across the barn .
 sounds fucking terrifying .
 imagine someone holding a lawnmower over his head while someone else pulls the cord .
 then use your imagination to put a big nsfl sticker over the whole thing and imagine a bunch of blood and body parts getting flung all over the nsfl sticker .
 i saw that happen in high school .
 the next day the teacher was just savage publicly calling it out .
 30+ years later i still remember him starting out the class congratulating todd on doing so well on the test ,  but next time ,  he didn &apos;t need to hand in two copies .
 oh ,  and by the way ,  i didn &apos;t get anything handed in by mike .
 sorry mike ,  you get a 0 .

 there are still people who fall for  &apos;if you post your password it comes up as asterisks !
 you are severely overestimating how many people remember middle school math .
 every person who is dead has consumed dihydrogen monoxide at some point in their lives .
 how about mine: a girl ,  when we were highschool juniors (17 !
 ) as we were reviewing for our final exam .
 asked  &apos;wait so who won the civil war ,  it was the south right ?
 much the same thing happened with my younger sister and i .
 we &apos;re 22 months apart but because of genetics ,  we were much the same size up until our teens .
 on more than one occasion my parents were asked if we were twins .
 sounds like these two would be a great couple if they haven’t died by now .
 less severe but i remember one of my classmates in high school came to school with a big burn on her forehead .
 everybody asked what happened and she said that she wanted to check if a lightbulb was hot but didn &apos;t want to burn her fingers .
 so she checked with her forehead .
 i kind of feel like things like that are just an expression of anger .
 i &apos;ve definitely been mad at inanimate objects before .
 no one expects it to actually have an effect .
 i saw someone just the other day who pulled down their mask to cough .
 it was a stunning event .
 entitlement is it’s own form of stupid .
 well if they wear masks it may slow the infection rate seeing as they wouldn &apos;t bite so easily .
 yes when people talk about the death count going down ,  what they mean is the daily death count going down .
 the count of people who die each day can go up or down .

 my boss did this !
 she called me from her car ,  crying hysterically ,  saying she left her phone behind at a meeting and would have to spend another hour going back for it .
 she was so upset i couldn’t get a word in edgewise .
 when she finally took a breath ,  i said ,  ‘what are you talking to me on ?
 ’  she said ,  ‘oh never mind’ and hung up on me lol
 theese fucking things set us to autopilot

 i won &apos;t be surprised if some flat earthers believe he was sabotaged to stop the  &apos;truth &apos; from coming out .
 so the dude prayed upon the poor innocent flat earthers for money to prove the earth was flat ?
 that &apos;s fuckin hilarious .
 please don &apos;t give anyone ideas .
 there were football players at my college who genuinely could not read .
 it is very common for school administration especially in small towns and poorer areas to pressure teachers to pass students so they can stay in sports
 what was the survey format like ?
 cause even people who knew they were the same thing would have to pick one of the two if there was no third option .
 i’ve experienced something similar at the restaurant i work at .
 if someone orders a glass of wine i ask “would you like a 6 oz or 8oz glass ?
 ” and they say “whichever is bigger .
 ” like i can understand maybe not knowing fractions ,  but you can’t verbalize that you know 8 is bigger than 6 ?
 kind of makes me sad really to think that people are so uneducated .
 4 out of every 3 people are bad at fractions .
 every time this shit gets repeated the correction is buried and unappreciated .
 i &apos;m sorry buddy .
 ah stoichiometry ,  i always enjoyed that little balancing act .
 i completely agree !
  i should have said that .
  i didn &apos;t even bother trying to explain it to them because i &apos;d rather they take that attitude .
 i mean ,  he was the son of god ,  born from a virgin mother .
 if he was white in the middle of jerusalem ,  that would be the least surprising thing about him .
 assuming that person was an adult i have no idea how they survived to adulthood while being that dumb .
 i can &apos;t imagine having freezing showers for a year and never thinking ,   &apos;hey i wonder what will happen if i turned that second knob ?
  &apos; or moved the lever if it was one of those sort of taps .
 i don &apos;t know if i completely blame that person though .
 i &apos;ve seen adults like that who &apos;ve had a parent who did absolutely everything for them and never allowed them to think for themselves .
 like the story i read a while ago of the boy who got his first job and had no idea how to use a broom and a mop .
 consider how stupid the average voter is ,  and think that half of the voters are more stupid than him
 i actually did this because i kept getting calls at night from some random person (friend of my husband’s crazy ex) harassing me ,  very late at night .
 i was going to work between 4-6am back then .
 so the first thing i would do is call them every morning as soon as i got to work .
 i worked in a huge hospital so the caller id was just the main generic hospital number and it couldn’t be traced even to any dept ,  much less to me personally .
 i would let it ring and ring and sometimes they’d wake up screaming into the phone ,  but i never said a word .
 they eventually stopped calling me in the middle of the night .
 that &apos;s the exact explanation i use !
 cell phones run on batteries ,  why not a car ?
 but for some people ,  they can &apos;t get it out of their head that car fuel = gas and only gas .
 my cat growing up used to bring home squirrel tails .
 must have brought back 18 or more tails over a 2 .
 5 year stint before becoming a road pancake .
 i now have indoor cats only .
 too much childhood feline induced trauma .
 there is a special hell for those people .
 my supervisor told me that one night (we work nights) he brought in a bucket of chicken for his lunch .
 at lunch he had some ,  but there was lots left over .
 he put the lid on ,  and slid it into our fridge and wrote his name on it .
 next night he comes in ,  bucket &apos;s there ,  which is good ,  because that was his lunch for the night .
 at 4am ,  he goes on his break .
 pulls the bucket out .
 feels a bit light ,  someone had been into it .
 he sets it down ,  pulls the top off ,  yup ,  just bones .
 some fucking guy not only ate all the remaining chicken ,  they left the bones and put the bucket back in the fridge .
 at 4am ,  there is nothing open around our office .
 my supervisor said he had to eat bags of chips from the vending machine for lunch .
  &apos;my computer is off and it won &apos;t turn on !
 walks up and switches the pc on .
 screen is black .
 i switch the monitor on and it works .
 then the employee blames technology .
 i &apos;ve seen my fair share of horrible pc users .
 and our ancestors fucked those bears and now we &apos;re the apex predator .
 some people also get offended when you try to let them know the price of something .
 do you think i can’t afford this ?
 this is actually common to field shows .
 marching bands have what &apos;s called a pit section filled with instruments that can only be played stationary such as drum sets guitars basses piano marimbas xylophones timpani etc .
 source: marched dci and 4 years of high school marching band in va .
 i was speaking about marching bands that do field shows
 i feel bad for the math parent .
  they aren &apos;t necessarily stupid but it is clear they lack education .
  &apos;i spent hours trying to open this bear-proof pick-a-nick basket only to find it was tourist-proof too !
 you have 5 seconds to figure out how to open a baby-proof drawer while cooking .
 a baby has allllll the time in the world .
 i &apos;ve heard stories of european tourists visiting the us ,  and thinking they can take a quick road trip from ny to vegas .
 honestly ,  if you can pull it off illegally ,  you deserve an award .
 so that &apos;s how people come to live in winnipeg
 people that stupid can &apos;t multiply 84 by 2 .
 you jest ,  but i &apos;ve had both ,  and rat terriers are actually very useful dogs compared to chihuahuas .
 my rat terrier kept my yard entirely vermin free for 15 years .
 she was immensely brave ,  loyal ,  and intelligent .
 at least she &apos;s well behaved .
  if she has a purpose besides cuddles i haven &apos;t figured it out yet .

 lol drying your junk with one is a great experience .
 lots of people put their damp jimmies in their underwear ,  and then wonder why it smells so bad at the end of the day .
 a dry basement smells better than a damp one .

 reminds me of a book by douglas adams .
    this group of people is struggling to solve a really baffling mystery whose answer was crucial to saving a bunch of people .
   but they &apos;re totally stuck without a clue .
  then one of them ,  dirk ,  yells  &apos;aha !
  &apos; and grabs some paper ,  and starts writing ,  and said  &apos;this is the answer .
  it explains everything .
  &apos;   one of the other people said  &apos;but this is just gibberish ,  it &apos;s not even words .
  &apos;  and dirk said  &apos;well yes ,  there &apos;s still work to be done .
  but now i &apos;ve reduced the whole thing to a matter of simply translating a page into english .
  sounds much more manageable ,  doesn &apos;t it ?
 you mean there was a world war before world war ii ?
 like a prequel ?
 it &apos;s not literally 100 minutes .
 it &apos;s just looking at time worked as a decimal like any other measurement .
 it makes sense from a payroll perspective .
 at my last job i could print out my time card and it had both time in and time out in regular format and just over to the side it would show time worked in this decimal format .
 that means you clocked in at 8am ,  clocked out at 4:30pm and worked a total of 8 .
 5 hours that day .
 it &apos;s a bit unintuitive ,  but you get used to it .
 did you hear about the woman in yellowstone who took a bison calf into her car and drove it to the nearest ranger station saying that  &apos;we believe the baby is cold &apos; ?
 the rangers had to put the calf down .
 responding officer arrives ,  takes a walk around the vehicle ,  leans in through an open window ,  and unlocks the car .
 the closer they are ,  the more they regulate .
 its theorized thats part of why kangaroo care helps nicu babies .
 i feel like i could be so much happier in life if i could learn this .
 the fact that i can’t probably just makes me a different kind of stupid .
 maybe if you knew their children ,  it would make perfect sense to you too .
 in their mind they probably see themselves as invincible ,  or at the very least don &apos;t see death as a likely possibility .
 after all they survived x decades already .
 meanwhile the rim on their 10 year old beat up caravan most definitely isn &apos;t invincible and would cost them $200 to replace ,  and they need that money for charlie &apos;s football gear .
 fun fact about china .
 as large as the country is ,  the chinese government makes the entire country be on one time zone .
 essentially it would be like east coast and west coast america operating the same hours .
 she would pay you 6 hours for 12 hours of work and fire you when you can &apos;t fulfill an office catering order in three hours ,  i know the service industry too well
  &apos;so you started today at 4pm and finished at 23:00; so 19 hours right ?
 future management material right here .
 this comment gets a thumbs up from me .
 well ,  the guy involved was army air corps ,  so you &apos;re not far off
  i have caught it at this level .
 this is impressive .
 is it an assumption you made as a kid that you never questioned as you got older ?
 everyone who consumes dihydrogen monoxide dies .
 we had an idiot (18) in school ,  a few years ago ,  who believed that hitler escaped to .
 we are germans and are learning about ww2 for three years straight and he still somehow believed that shit .
 i guess his brain was already rotten from the sheer amount of alkohol he consumed .
 my sister and i aren’t even biologically related .
 people are always saying that they could tell we’re sisters because we look so much alike .
 a modern romeo and juliet !
 instead of meeting at a party ,  they meet in the er for being complete fucking morons ,  and then end up killing themselves because they are complete fucking morons .
 ah ,  young romance !
 i hate miscalculating doorways .
 like ,  sometimes i &apos;m just the right kind of distracted that my brain stops tracking things correctly and i smack into the frame as i &apos;m walking into a room .
 doesn &apos;t happen often but when it does .
 oooooh get out of my way you fuckin &apos; door frame .
 say something ,  i &apos;ll teach you good !
 the door frame:  &apos; .
  &apos;yeah ,  that &apos;s what i thought .
 take your comment back !
 i did that with a sneeze on reflex of wanting to sneeze in my arm ,  didn &apos;t even make it to my arm in time ,  and felt like a moron because i had been a moron .
 imagine a zombie pandemic of all people who died wearing masks and they can &apos;t bite anyone so they &apos;re not really a threat but just a nuisance that we deal with now in our day to day lives .
 searching for glasses for 15 mins and realising i &apos;m wearing them
 you know ,  this probably is exactly the logic that makes this 5g stupidity seem reasonable to some people .
 they weren &apos;t asked which they preferred .
 they were asked to give their opinion on the aca or obamacare (i .
  ,  different questions to different people) .
 people were much more in favor when the term aca was used over obamacare .
 i used to work restaurants and ran into the same thing .
 i always took it to mean “i want you to know i had a rough day and want the most booze possible” rather than actually not knowing which is larger .
 there are 3 kinds of people: those who can count ,  and those who can &apos;t .
 stoichiometry is literally 5th-grade ratios class with elements and moles instead of numbers .
 that’s exactly why i would never ,  ever ask someone if they were aware of the price of the item they were ordering .
 the prices were very clearly listed on the menus .
 it would’ve been considered super inappropriate to ask that of our guests .
 it implies that you don’t think they can afford it ,  and this was not the kind of clientele that would’ve accepted that type of insult .
 my high school marching band had an electric guitar so it &apos;s not an impossibility .
 gotta find a music teacher thats adventurous !
 and it &apos;s so admirable they &apos;re trying to learn to teach their children right .
 not every parent is around to help with homework ,  or they simply don &apos;t bother to be involved in their child &apos;s education .
 at least from what i &apos;ve seen .
 to go and basically admit you &apos;re struggling with your kid &apos;s homework is kinda ballsy to me tbh .
 respect to them .
 also doesn’t help that kids that small have insane levels of nueroplasticity and can and will learn everything and anything they are physically capable of doing faster than an adult can bc their brains are set to “sponge and multiply mode” while adult brains are set on “let’s throw out a fuck ton of brain cells bc we haven’t used them in a hot second”
 hell i &apos;ve talked to europeans who are interested when i tell them i &apos;m from near philadelphia ,  how they want to plan a trip to see philly ,  historical sites ,  etc .
 there was the one who said  &apos;and while i &apos;m there ,  i &apos;ll take a day trip to pittsburgh since it &apos;s in pennsylvania ,  too .
 sure ,  if you want to wake up at 3 am ,  drive 5 hours ,  stay for the day ,  leave around dinner and get back at midnight .
 and that &apos;s just one state that &apos;s not even that big compared to many others .
 for reference ,  i took my now wife to newport ,  ri for her birthday one year .
 we were in 5 different states (pa ,  nj ,  ny ,  ct and ri) on the drive and it was a shorter trip than philly to pittsburgh .
 americans think 100 years is a long time ,  while europeans think 100 miles is a long distance .
 probably a darwin award .
  i doubt you could make that return trip in one day on a commercial airline .
 well i didn &apos;t vote for ya .
 nah like a bojack horseman
 yep ,  always let the family jewels completely dry out before covering em up .
 donkey doug is that you ?
 yeah but it was like star wars .
 first ,  ww2 happened .
 then ,  they added a prequel .
 oh ,  so the  &apos;: &apos; is actually a decimal point  .
 there are no minutes here ,  just fractions of hours .
 this is just asking for misinterpretation .
 or the guy in yellowstone who walked 200 yards off the boardwalk at the guisers and fell into a vat of boiling water .
 i &apos;m just imagining the doctors placing a baby in a kangaroo pouch
 just had my son 8 days ago ,  and started doing kangaroo care with him ,  and this is exactly what the doctors and nurses in the nicu told me .
 we are lucky that my son is very stable and in good health ,  just small ,  but man ,  the second he is laying on my husband or myself ,  his heart rate ,  breathing ,  everything just goes completely steady .
 it’s actually quite amazing to see .
 don &apos;t try to convince them that they lost .
 convince bystanders that they are fuckwit pigeons .
 that &apos;s the only victory that matters .
 don &apos;t people in western china do things 3 hours later anyway
 not from the infantryman though
 all i need to say .
 i’m not a huge fan of seafood so i never really had the need to question that assumption .
 i was 25 or so when someone ordered a shrimp cocktail and i discovered the truth .
 i also learned there isn’t alcohol in a shrimp cocktail ,  it was a day just full of disappointment
 maybe he thought that monty python sketch was a documentary
 that happens to me a lot too !
 me and my sister share the same birthday too—but two years apart .
 people refuse to see past the day + month and think we are twins .
 honestly ,  you could have the same ending ,  but romero drinks the bleach instead of a fake poison
 my dad cant see too well ,  so he put on his glasses .
 to find his glasses
 that ,  or they &apos;re not really paying attention to what you &apos;re saying ,  and just want whatever the biggest size you have is .
 there are two kinds of people: those who can extrapolate from incomplete data .
 and it took until one of my senior level engineering classes for us to be  &apos;allowed &apos; to leave decimal coefficients ,  rather than having to multiply everything to get  &apos;nice &apos; whole numbers .
 did you end up telling him something along those lines ?
 i’d love to have seen his face after you told him inferring that they might not to be able to afford something would be extremely rude .
 btw ,  how do you like working there ?
 i work (well ,  before covid) at a midrange restaurant .
 i’ve always wondered if working at a place with wealthy clientele would be nice because maybe they’d have some class ,  or are they just like everyone else but worse ?
 i think the year before i started marching band the show was the beatles and there was a bass player and full drum kit stationary on the front of the field .
 but it &apos;s not uncommon to have auxiliary percussion and rhythm instruments be there and just not march .
 my kid figured out how to climb onto a chair by himself yesterday .
 today i had to find new places for everything that had been  &apos;up &apos; to stay out of his way .
 yeah ,  it takes about 5 hours to get to savannah from ne georgia .
 and that’s using the shortcut through south carolina .
 100 miles used to be my roundtrip work commute every day haha
 this is the essence of how we view the world right here .
 you can easily do this with a commercial airline .
 early morning departure ,  land 11am ish .
 lunch ,  afternoon ,  early dinner ,  10pm flight back to yyc .
 private flight makes it even easier .
 listen ,  strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government .
 supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses ,  not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .
 not bad actually .
 he was in a very famous tv show back in the nineties ,  after all .
 could be a pill boy move
 or the other one in yellowstone where the guy walked off the boardwalk and got into one of the hot springs (can &apos;t remember if he fell in or wanted to  &apos;hot tub &apos;) .
 turned out to be basically acid ,  and his body dissolved .
 while his sister was there watching .
 i had to reread it for that exact reason .
 i ,  for a very brief second ,  wondered why i’d never heard that hospitals had kangaroos to help in nicu .
 my husband did kangaroo care with my babies immediately after birth (i had to be knocked out completely for emergency surgery for completely different reasons .
 i suck at childbirth .
 ) funny story ,  he didn &apos;t know how goopy babies start out .
 went to kiss the top of our first &apos;s head .
 yeah ,  but it’s still the same time zone
 spain actually does a similar thing .
 francisco franco moved the clocks forward one hour to be in the same time zone as germany after a visit from hitler .
 even though geographically ,  spain should share a time zone with england .
 a couple of hundred little ones though
 i definitely catch it there too .
  a few years ago i had a test question in an intro to programming course .
  to mix things up a bit ,  i had them run a function where the input string was the first 4 letters of their first name followed by the first 3 of their last name (with some padding rules for students whose first/last weren &apos;t long enough) .
 this made me sad for you .
 i &apos;m gonna grab some tequila and a few sea horses ,  post your address and i &apos;ll let you know when i &apos;m on my way
 i had a really hard day ,  and this made it so much better .
 the sweet innocence of just learning this is wonderful .
 i went past the same intersection 6 times a day for almost that entire time .
 3 weeks ago ,  i saw a huge ,  yellow funeral home 2 buildings from the corner ,  and thought ,   &apos;huh ,  when did they put that there ?
 i just never noticed it .
 if the dick don’t fit ,  you must acquit !
 there are 10 kinds of people .
 those who undersand binary .
 those who don &apos;t  .
 and those who understand this is a base three joke .
 i told him that it would’ve been highly inappropriate and presumptive of me to ask the wife if she was aware of the price of the item she had ordered while she was pointing to that item where the price was clearly visible .
 he then countered that actually ,  no ,  he thinks it’s inappropriate for us not to confirm the prices of expensive things with people before we serve them .
 i then explained that we’re in an establishment with a very expensive menu with many items in that price range and much higher that people order very regularly .
 it would be  rude of me to ask every time a guest ordered say ,  a $2 , 000 bottle of wine “are you sure ?
 did you see the price there ma’am ?
 ” or if you have a guest order an expensive cognac mixed with diet coke or something .
 it would hurt my broke heart to make that drink ,  but i would never be like “are you sure ?
 you do know that’s an $300 spirit you’re ruining right ?
 ” it’s not my place to do any of that or assume someone can or can’t afford the thing they requested .
 he was just angry and wasn’t getting it .
 he tried to argue that “i can’t believe anyone would ever order anything this expensive !
 ” again ,  i just had to reply that i’m sorry he felt that way ,  but our guests order items that expensive every single day ,  and it was a common occurrence for us ,  otherwise we wouldn’t offer them .
 there was nothing that could be said to placate this guy ,  so i just removed myself and had the manager deal with it .
 to answer your question ,  that place had its positives and negatives .
 obviously the tips on those sales were a huge positive for the staff .
 the clientele was usually pretty great .
 old money types were fine ,  maybe a bit out of touch with stuff sometimes due to their wealth ,  but generally really polite and a pleasure to deal with .
 business clientele was fine too because everything for them was a write off ,  so they weren’t personally attached to the money they were spending and thus spent it more freely .
 the worst were the people who came in just to “look” like they had money or to impress a date or something .
 the women who would come in on the prowl for rich men too .
 could’ve done without their attitudes ,  but they provided for great entertainment .
 the “new money” types were almost always assholes and were generally pretty douchey .
 super entitled about things and not polite in the least .
 i think they felt like they had to “prove” their worth there or something .
 meanwhile ,  i’m like ,  dude ,  i’m a server making minimum wage ,  i don’t care about your bullshit vacation or bag or car or trophy girlfriend or whatever ,  save that for the other guests and just be polite to the person bringing you your drinks .
 your tab tonight cost more than my monthly bills .
 oh ,  and the people that couldn’t really afford to dine there would still order the expensive things and then just tip like shit because they couldn’t afford the drinks and the service .
 didn’t stop them from buying them to keep up appearances or impress their date or whoever though .
 overall ,  the experience was usually positive aside from the odd negative experience like the guy in the initial story .
 thankfully the management was pretty good about dealing with things ,  and our regulars would usually make up for the shitty guests .
 hope that helps !
 my kid figured out getting on to chairs fairly recently too ,  and we had to move a load of stuff .
 this week i discovered that he &apos;s figured out how to move the chairs before climbing onto them ,  so a load of the stuff i &apos;d moved now needs moving further .
 running out of places to put things out of his reach .
 baby-proofed cupboards only slow him down for a minute or so at most .
 it &apos;s all tinned food and stainless steel stuff below counter-height now ,  stuff he can &apos;t break easily .
 los angeles (california) and houston (texas) are nearly the same distance to el paso ,  texas .
 from brownsville ,  texas to amarillo ,  texas it &apos;s 12 hours of driving .
 yeah ,  texas is huge !
 this is the kind of thing i point out when people from the eu tell us we have such cheap gas .
 yeah ,  it &apos;s half the price but we have to use three times as much of it .
 of course ,  for the last couple of months ,  my commute has been the length of my house ,  bit that &apos;s neither here nor there .
 timezones are neat .
 i could tell almost to the minute when those in the eu woke up ,  got on reddit ,  saw my comment ,  and started coming up with anecdotes about a place most of them have never been .
 and the up express train makes the journey trivial .
 25 minutes each way from yyz to downtown ,  stopping steps from the cn tower .
 there’s even a “layover” half price fair if you’re downtown less than 4 hours .
 well you can &apos;t expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you
 that is the one i was thinking of .
 i was actually at yellowstone when it happened .
 the area he died in was completely closed off so we had to change our plans ,  he did that the day before we were going to that area of the park .
 i have the same combination on my luggage !
 they sound like trying to keep a wild racoon in the house and out of your stuff
 i remember the first time i drove through i-10 coast to coast ,  we broke it up into three legs: jacksonville to beaumont ,  texas ,  el paso to la .
 all three legs took roughly the same time ,  with texas taking the longest .
 when we first got over the louisiana/texas border ,  there was a sign: welcome to texas !
 followed by another sign: .
 el paso ,  992 miles away .
 if i went around saying i was an emperor just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me ,  they’d put me away !
 watch out for the black dog on the walnut wood floor in the dark ,  she is causing pileups .
 early morning collision between a sock-footed pedestrian and cat vomit has resulted in significant delays in transit time along the major transportation corridor .
 shut up will you shut up
 we have reports coming in- someone dumped a bunch of legos between bedroom door #2 and upstairs bath .
 proceed with caution; clean up is on scene
 well ,  now we’re seeing the violence inherent in the system !
 help ,  help ,  i’m being repressed !
 the clown epidemic of  &apos;16
 men’s styles - patterned short sleeved button down shirts ,  flannel shirts ,  beards ,  high and tight haircuts .
 women’s styles - yoga pants ,  athleisure ,  jumpsuits/rompers ,  “coachella” attire (don’t know how else to describe this but it’s a distinct look) .
 music - country ,  mumble hip hop ,  bad repetitive pop ,  edm and festivals .
 tech - automation ,  social media ,  data ,  mobile .
 social networks and how everyone thought it was a good idea to keep track of everyone in their life .
 kids in 10 years will be like “so you met this guy at the pub and .
 added him into your social network ?
 didn’t that give him access to all your social details ?
 privacy will become the biggest thing ever ,  and loose social media connections will become the exact thing not to do .
 you know when you watch documentaries now about kids in the 80s hitchhiking or stepping into a serial killers van because they said they had puppies in there ,  and you scream at the tv like what are you doing you idiot ?
 that’s how people will think of our 2010s years .
 spending the entire decade thinking last year was 2008 .
 for europe it will definitely be the refugee crisis
 they will remember: .
 -crazy colored hair .
 -trying to dress like people in the 90s .
 -those old iphones that everyone had and thought were so cool but look like bricks now .
 -overly photoshopped and facetuned photos .
 -back when youtube actually allowed relatively normal people to become famous .
 the death of brick and mortar and the rise of amazon prime .
  &apos;people ask me where i &apos;m going to be in four months ,  i don &apos;t have 2020 vision &apos; jokes .
 the 2010 &apos;s will be probably be remembered for as the  &apos;remake era &apos; for disney .
 looking forward to this thread being unearthed in 2029 .
 :) i hope y’all are doing better than us !
 my generation is going to be known for wanting to die and memes .
 guess we can replace generation for decade
 the rise of the smartphone .
 everyone has access to the internet and can voice their opinion towards the world at any moment with all the negative effects that it brings .
 they will remember how great summer 2016 was .
 i removed the comma .
 edit 2: wow my first medal of any kind ,  thanks stranger .
 the social media explosion
 minecraft’s rise ,  fall ,  and rise again
 real headlines trying to outdo the onion .
 i don &apos;t like this realization
 the death of traditional media .
 printed newspapers and periodicals ,  broadcast television and radio are fading .
 and while digital music way predates the 2010s ,  it took until this decade for pop stars to stop  &apos;selling &apos; albums .
 they aren &apos;t tallying cd sales anymore ,  they &apos;re counting unique streams .
 people are gonna reminisce about how good the 2010 &apos;s were .
 they may not seem good now ,  but just wait to see what the 20 &apos;s have in store for you .
 i hate being right .
 social  media / influencers  .
 netflix/ streaming (it was available before 2010 ,  but didnt get reliable until after) .
 swipe dating apps ,  the word  &apos;online dating &apos; and dating sites are now swapped with the phrases  &apos;dating apps &apos; .
 from a video game standpoint ,  this is the decade of the indie explosion ,  esports ,  battle royales and micro transactions .
 from a cinematic standpoint ,  this is the age of superheroes .
 comic book movies dominated in the last decade and they are not going anywhere anytime soon .
 depression and memes .
 but really i think mental health will be one of the biggest problems going forward and this is going to be known as the times when it emerged as a problem .
 the incredible rise of misinformation and irresponsible kneejerk reaction choices on very serious topics .
 we &apos;ve been at war for 18 fucking years
 didn &apos;t see it here so i &apos;ll mention it .
 the syrian civil war and  rise and fall of the islamic state .
 the decade that normalized eating ass
 the meme renaissance
 the wild switch from president obama to president trump .
  say what you want good or bad about either of them ,  but their ways of doing the job are very different in many ways .
 thanks for the gold and silver ,  whoever you are .
 the horrific turn the area 51 raid took resulting in hundreds dead and the unleashing of angry captive aliens upon the world to exact their revenge on humanity
 i &apos;m just hoping that the 20 &apos;s will be the resurgence of gangster suits ,  black fedoras ,  and saying things like ,   &apos;i &apos;ll punch you into mush ,  see ?
 the 2010 &apos;s will rememebered as the decade where everyone went from chill to radicalized in a suprisngly short span of time .
 how quick it went .
 wait wait wait ,  last decade wasn &apos;t the 90s ?
 gangnam style and harambe
 the dress was blue .
 how’re y’all gonna leave out the most influential trend of the 2010’s ?
 fidget spinners  .
 they united us as a nation in a time where our country was divided more than ever .
 they solved add overnight while boosting our economy to levels unseen since the pog craze of the 90’s !
 don’t ever forget this
 the promulgation of the internet .
 the 2010s saw the popularity of smartphones which has revolutionized many industries .
 the internet is way more a force now than it was pre 2010 .
 network tv isn &apos;t a thing because of the internet .
 brick and mortar stores are dying because of the internet .
 shitty geico and progressive commercials .
 the beginning of automation .
 a ton of jobs are already automated but this decade was probably the true beginning ,  from testing driverless cars and drones to entire service industries being replaced by self service counters .
 this will truly be the beginning of automated industries .
 knowing that global warming is going to hit us hard and doing virtually nothing about it globally
 i &apos;ve only been alive 2 decades ,  so take what i have to say with a grain of salt .
 but i think this will be remembered as the decade when the physical world was overtaken the online world .
 dating is online .
 classes are online .
 news is online ,  and it &apos;s about what politicians said online .
 presidential campaigns are internet memes .
 print media and physical music are disappearing .
 our jobs are being taken by ai .
 the jobs we have left are done on computers .
 the cloud knows more data about us than we do .
 you have to have an email to sign up for anything ,  and apps are constantly trying to wring more digital data out of us .
 i know this sounds conspiratorial .
 personally i &apos;m not against it ,  i think we just have to find a balance .
 how stupid it was to get rid of the aux jack on phones
 i always think about this .
 the 80s were defined by optimistic decadence and a neon future ,  the 90s were a hangover from the 80s ,  dominated by grunge and grit ,  lead by the freedom fighters and suburban rebel rock .
 the 00s is when the effects of globalism really started to take hold  .
 ultimately i feel like the 00s were a positive time ,  when we experienced a brief utopia of man and machine which led to a lot of realization ,  inspiration and evolution .
 however ,  the (r)evolution was somewhat organic ,  and even though we experienced an economic downturn ,  the future looked bright .
 the 10s were plastic .
 we let a reality tv show host become president .
 we realized the dystopian future that we read about in books and saw in movies .
 the boundaries of what is real have been stretched and shattered .
 the rich are living in a separate reality in their high rises and the poor are killing each other in the streets .
 it has been a time of dark hedonism ,  which i think will result in a following period of enlightenment and return to nature .
 i think this decade will be remembered for a few big things (at least in the us): .
 the name of the game this decade .
 millennials were at the center of almost every major cultural conversation .
 from social media and technology to jobs and the economy .
 hipsters and smart phones and gaming systems and trends and facebook and instagram ,  etc ,  etc .
 millennials had the biggest cultural impact of this decade .
 obama was elected last decade ,  but most of his term was this decade .
 he got bin laden ,  passed healthcare ,  and triggered a whole bunch of people just because he was black .
 then trump really popped up in 2015 for his presidential run (was it really that long ago ?
 ) and he &apos;s been at the forefront of news ever since .
 20 mcu movies have been released this decade .
 then there are the other spider-man movies ,  the dc universe movies (nolan &apos;s and snyder &apos;s) ,  as well as countless other movies and shows .
 last decade was zombies ,  this decade is superheroes .
 ill just say that this is the best question on askreddit that ive seen yet
 people believing vaccines are fake
 memes and minecraft .
 i &apos;m gonna remember the 2010s as my decade of adversity .
 some of these years have been the toughest of my life ,  hopefully i can look at the 2020s as the best of my life .
 brexit ,  trump as president ,  #metoo ,  #blacklivesmatter ,  leonardo dicaprio got an oscar
 black president ,  orange president ,  and tide pods .
 the decade twitter definied politics
 it was the best of times ,  it was the worst of times ,  it was the age of wisdom ,  it was the age of foolishness ,  it was the epoch of belief ,  it was the epoch of incredulity ,  it was the season of light ,  it was the season of darkness ,  it was the spring of hope ,  it was the winter of despair .
 cannabis legalization movement .
  as a graduate during the economic recession ,  its the only real positive thing i remember in the past decade .
  and the crazy american cultural swing from obama to trump .
  its the decade when all governments became a joke .
 that feels like a fever dream we all collectively had .
 i thought that was it advertising ?
 how about the epidemic of ‘16 in general ?
 nothing made sense that year .
 this should be number 1 .
 people generally don’t care about change and politics as much as they do the culture .
 yoga pants best invention of the decade
 don &apos;t forget the dubstep hype from 2012
 2010s have ,  imo ,  been the greatest decade for music of all time .
 streaming services has given so much more opportunity for creativity and diversity of music .
 i think mumble hip hop and repetitive pop downplays this decades musical quality .
 that’s a very interesting thought and a great way to put it too .
 i suffer from this .
 makes it hell remembering my kids’ birthdays .
 i am genuinely curious to see how that will turn out .
 not taking a side here .
 i just want to see if they will properly integrate into society without issues .
 because we’ll all regret it in 10 years .
 the rise of ceo wages .
  goin from being paid 50x more than an average worker to 500 ,  5 , 000 ,  50 , 000 ,  fucking damn near close to 500 , 000 .
 a great tool horribly mismanaged
 i am waiting with bated breath to have the chance to sink my teeth into  &apos;i hate it when people ask me what i &apos;ll be doing in 0 years ,  come on guys i don &apos;t have 2020 vision &apos;
 that would require a change of direction for disney in the 2020s and i just don’t see that happening .
 2029 seems like a hundred years away but 2009 to now flew .
 i hope i’m done college by then and have a job or i’ll be in some trouble lol .
 we &apos;re the doomer generation ,  not the millennials .
 or maybe that &apos;s gen z .
 idk ,  it &apos;s all a mess right now .
 imho ,  this is the biggest one .
 the iphone came out in what ,  2007 ?
 it was a solid year or two before you had traction there .
 now ,  phones have pretty much replaced most people &apos;s home computers for menial tasks .
 it &apos;s interesting that this is so far down the thread .
 smartphones are definitely the biggest one .
 social media is a massive influence (and it was mentioned further up the thread) but for most people ,  they connect to social media through their smartphones anyways .
 and ultimately phones probably had the biggest visible effect on the world in the 2010s .
 cell towers are now visible everywhere in cities and suburbs ,  and you always see people walking around with their phones out - a sight that would be surprising to someone from the 80s or 90s .
 the first few weeks of pokémon go were magical !
 i think we all died after the summer of 2016 .
 it hasn’t been the same since
 i remember thinking after the string of celebrity deaths that things were getting better by summer ,  and the world was on an upswing .
 i was very very wrong .
 social media is fuckin insane .
 it gives the people so much power and yet ,  it also has so much power to manipulate the people .
 and the  &apos;20s will be the implosion .
 we &apos;re already sick of ourselves .
 harambe lives in our hearts forever
 social media is the reason internet changed fundamentally .
 it used to be more of a thing for  &apos;nerds &apos; in 2000s ,  now everyone and their grandma uses it .
 i miss the simpler times .
 this is the only answer .
 it has radically changed society ,  and imo may end up being its downfall due to the ease of spreading misinformation to the masses .
 mojang should hang a poster or something .
 that is the most onion way of putting it .
 that &apos;s never going to happen .
  the onion headline about the president causing a controversy by drawing on a map with a sharpie still cracks me up .
 i struggle to tell the difference at this point
 it didn &apos;t even cross my mind to me until reading this post .
 the 90s are soon 30 years ago .
 i’m unable to compute the question because time is disappearing .
 their death will be in the 20s .
 they were still huge in the 10s ,  but began losing their revenue and popularity .
 i feel the final nail will come sometime around the halfway point .
 i don &apos;t think radio is going anywhere anytime soon .
 so many people listen to it when driving and construction sites are filled with radios .
 i can walk from one end of site  to the other and not miss a beat because of how many people have radios out .
 in canada at least .
 i feel like the 2010s have two cultural zeitgeists much like the 1990s .
 1998 was vastly different in appearance from 1991 ,  just watch media from both years .
 i believe the 2010s will be similar .
 2014 wasn’t that long ago but it already seems different from 2016-2019 .
  ,  it’s very subtle and most people wouldn’t be able to tell but stuff like this is fascinating to me .
 in my opinion ,  were already in the 2020s and it may have started last month with headlines about the first alleged crime committed in space ,  protestors in hk knocking down facial recognition towers and pointing lasers at devices to disrupt the the technology .
 the amazon is burning and we are about to enter a new recession and the divide between left and right has widened exponentially since 2016 .
 honestly ,  this happens with any thing that happened 20 years ago .
 i can find forums from the 2000’s saying that the 2000’s suck ,  just for a decade later for them to miss it sooo much .
 nostalgia is just a stupid fad .
 when the 2030’s roll around and people are nostalgic for the 2010’s i’ll just laugh in their faces .
 obama/trump (from ‘10-now) feels like it’s been two separate decades during the one .
 people will remember social media ,  but i have a very strong feeling nobody’s going to give a shit about these “influencers” anymore in the future .
 i think we &apos;ll eventually look back at superhero movies the way that we look back at cowboy movies .
 not just superheros .
 this is the age of sequels ,  remakes ,  reboots ,  and adaptations of other source material (i .
 e comic books ,  novels ,  even video games) .
 mainstream original blockbusters are pretty much being done only by like tarantino and scorsese .
 vr is an actual thing now .
 a move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting ,  outdoor tables with giant jenga blocks ,  edison bulbs ,  and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard .
 in big cities ,  that is true; in smaller communities ,  chain restaurants are more prevalent than ever before .
 in southern ontario ,  communities that had no tim hortons a decade ago but had a locally owned mom-and-pop coffee shop or diner now have tim hortons .
 (brighton ,  ilderton ,  and komoka are just three of those towns) .
 it’s very hard to find locally owned businesses in smaller communities nowadays ,  at least in canada .
 a move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting ,  outdoor tables with giant jenga blocks ,  edison bulbs ,  and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard .
 this is painfully true .
 it &apos;s funny how every decade has its  &apos;accidental conformities ,  &apos; the above for the 2010s ,  the glass brick and chrome bars of the 1980s ,  the friends coffee-house aesthetic of the 1990s .
 every restaurant tries to be new and different -- in the exact same way ,  inspired by the era in which it lives .
 i love those craft beer/chalkboard/edison bulb places ,  but you &apos;re absolutely right that when movies in the future show people having a night out in the 2010s ,  that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;ll show .
 just like the  &apos;chotchkie &apos;s or flinger &apos;s &apos; restaurants captured the zeitgeist of the late 1990s in  &apos;office space &apos; or dark wood-paneled restaurants evoke the 1970s .
 that being said ,  the decor behind some trendy upscale bars today definitely is showing a little bit of 1980s influence in some places .
 thank you for mentioning the all white kitchens .
 i’ve said for the pst 5 years that in the future an all white kitchen will be seen as quintessential 2010 and eventually seem extremely outdated .
 it’s the new wood panel .
 minimalism/flat design ,  mostly due to the rise of tablets and browsing the internet on mobile devices .
 clean lines ,  simple colors like black ,  white and grey .
 i like this one .
 i &apos;m a fan of flat design tbh ,  i wonder how it &apos;ll hold up in later years .
 will it look as dated as stereotypical 90s mall/bowling-alley decor ,  or will people still appreciate it ?
 mostly i wonder what &apos;s going to replace it .
 it &apos;ll be interesting if we turn back towards skeuomorphism (for computer/phone uis specifically)
 “a move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting ,  outdoor tables with giant jenga blocks ,  edison bulbs ,  and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard .
 and car interiors will replace dashboards and gauges with touch screens .
 as someone who deives a lot at night i prefer the dim red glow of the dials since it preserves your night vision .
 i actually hate the removal of a lot of the gauges in general .
 i want to see what engine temp is ,  not just a fucking light that turns on telling me it &apos;s too hot .
 but i &apos;m an outlier i suppose .
 all houses are painted in that “griege” color and have all-white kitchens with that same white subway tile backsplash .
 there is probably a barn door ,  shiplap accent wall ,  and a fiddle-leaf fit inside .
 big love to this observation .
 always amusing when people nail contemporary trends in real time when most of the participants aren &apos;t fully aware they &apos;re part of something that will be gently mocked in one upcoming generational shift (i &apos;m looking at you ,  beard hipsters .
 a friend of mine recently bought a house built in 1984 ,  the place  was 100% original .
 it was fucking glorious .
 golden oak ,  more golden oak ,  golden oak here ,  golden oak there ,  golden oak kitchen ,  golden oak trim .
 i never realized just how era-specific that look was until i walked into a 35 year old time capsule of a house .
 you &apos;re 100% right ,  that exact look you described is what 99% of my friends have and is very specific to this era of decor !
  almost every new car from the decade is elaborately styled .
 it might just be their ubiquity ,  but post-2000 cars all look sort of samey to me .
 mental health did not emerge as a problem in this decade .
 however ,  it was recognized as a problem .
 to clarify ,  i mean it was always a problem ,  just nobody realized it
 why would it be a problem ?
 it just gets ignored until a celebrity commits suicide ,  then gets ignored again 4 days later .
 like red lipstick or a nice wrist watch ,  depression is timeless .
 i do really like that memes are starting to normalize going to therapy and bringing mental health issues up .
 we all go thru it or know someone who is ,  the time to talk about it is now .
 that’s not new at all .
 why do people think fake news and hysteria is a new phenomenon ?
 it was only 15 years ago we went to war with iraq because everyone uncritically believed the government and media when we were told saddam was building nuclear weapons .
 for about a hundred years in american history ,  every few months some black guy or immigrant would be baselessly accused of a crime and then an angry mob would come together to publicly execute him .
 120 years ago ,  the so-called “yellow journalists” lied us into another war ,  with spain .
 yknow how they say every new generation thinks they invented sex ?
 well this generation thinks lying and dishonesty are some kind of new phenomenon ,  as well as gullible and hysterical reactions to lies and dishonesty .
 it’s nothing new .
 yeah ,  some kids who were born after 9/11 can enlist in the army now .
 shit the syrian civil war will still being going next decade fret not
 even now ,  it already seems forgotten .
  i &apos;m not sure how well it will be remembered given that .
 we &apos;ll be able to point to the current refugee crisis (in part stemming from the syrian civil war and the war against is) as the point when something in our global economy/political system needed desperate reform ,  since the number of climate refugees in the coming decades is going to make this one look like a joke .
 we also have the arab spring at the very beginning beginning of the decade ,  the belt and road initiative and other symbols of china &apos;s global power ,  the relative decline of the u .
 as the global hegemon and the rise of right-wing populism in the west (adding on since yours is pretty much the only geopolitics-related comment here) .
 definitely for the rise of smartphones .
 they were around in the late 00s ,  but it &apos;s wasn &apos;t until the 10s that basically everyone had to have one .
 now they &apos;re so ubiquitous that it &apos;s considered kind of weird when someone doesn &apos;t have a smartphone .
 at my wedding ,  some friends created a dance routine to party rock as a surprise for us .
 what nobody at the wedding knew was ,  by complete coincidence ,  i had previously learned the dance break from the music video because i thought it was so damn cool .
 when the dance break came up during their performance ,  i jumped in with them ,  danced the dance break ,  and sat back down .
 i &apos;ll never forget the look on everyone &apos;s faces .
 2011 was such a rad time to go to college house parties
 those guys had the quickest retirement of all time
 we were in the house last night .
 we had a good time .
 but the party’s over now :(
 started off as image macros ,  ended as screenshots of tweets .
 chapter 7:  &apos;memes were the quintessential milennial mode of expression ,  akin to the hieroglyphics of egypt and the cuneiform tablets of sumer .
 early 21st century internet savants populated their facebook feeds with fan favorites such as lolcats and philosoraptor .
 as the trend caught on ,  memes diversified and developed ,  getting adopted by such institutions as politics ,  academia ,  and post-modern avant-garde expressionism .
 as memes became more sophisticated ,  so too did their influence over society .
 the charged political landscape ignited a trend of weaponizing them for political use ,  culminating into the bloody meme wars of 2028 .
 everything was going great .
 then ,  this fucking gorilla .
 my theory (as someone who wasn’t born in canada but have lived here all my life): .
 people are so comfortable in western society and life is so predictable and safe and secure that people can now afford to sit there and complain and be outraged by any little thing they don’t like for any reason because there is no reason for them to worry about anything that will threaten their existence .
 as someone who spent formative years in a dirt ass poor country ,  people in north america are so cushy and safe that they think there is some massive conspiracy to turn your fucking kids autistic through a vaccine .
 it blows my mind .
 yeah ,  go ask people in india how it feels seeing someone walk with a polio limp and how grateful they would be at the thought of being able to have received a vaccine for it .
 as if doctors are all conspiring around the world to make your kids suffer .
 ah yes ,  the  &apos;rage-gasm &apos;
 don &apos;t forget the military being defeated by swarms of naruto runners ,  leading to new arms limitation treaties banning the use of the naruto run in any armed conflict .
 kind of wish they hadn &apos;t made the date so far .
 the meme has already died down and i keep forgetting about it .
 and leaning against a street lamp at night flipping a coin in the air with your thumb .
  and calling women  &apos;dames &apos; .
  and calling assholes  &apos;finks &apos; and if they &apos;re really bad ,   &apos;rat-finks &apos; .
 they already tried bringing fedoras back in the early 10 &apos;s .
 it wasn &apos;t a good idea .
 and hopefully we get the same sort of economic boom as the roaring 20s .
 just with no 29 crash .
 this is a joke ,  but i can see some celebrity rock old school 1920 &apos;s fits ,  modernizing them and bringing them back .
 ill say it now ,  if  the culture can make fedora acceptable again ,  anything is possible
 i just cant accept that the 20 &apos;s would be 2020 &apos;s .
 i still see it as 1920 &apos;s
 yeah ,  i lost an entire decade too .
 you put that comment away .
 first thought was  &apos;but the clinton era was 199- oh that dress .
 it did give insight in to how different people &apos;s brains perceive colour .
 and also blew a lot of peoples &apos; minds over just how badly a photo can be taken that it makes a blue and black dress look like it &apos;s white and gold to about 30% of people .
 about 10% of people saw it as blue and brown (the actual pixel colours) and another 10% could willingly flip between the different combinations .
 yeah ,  geico commercials were way better in the 00 &apos;s .
 this decade has been terrible for insurance commercials
 you can add limu emu ,  i change the channel so fast when one comes on .
 to be fair ,  it began long long ago with the industrial revolution .
 but i &apos;d say we &apos;ll remember 2010 as the birth of ai automation .
 the age of artificial intelligence will in my opinion blow up even more in the 20s .
 the 1800 &apos;s and beyond would like to have a word .
 same goes for many public health issues in the united states ,  like opioid addiction ,  antimicrobial resistance ,  vaping (mainly due to lack of fda oversight/regulation) ,  anti-vaxxers ,  etc .
 for the most part we’re talking a lot about it but not actually doing much so far .
 and everyone has it at their fingertips .
 i don’t believe i got a smartphone until 2010 and now i do most things (checking emails ,  calendar ,  news ,  games ,  etc) on my phone rather than computer .
 i recently bought a galaxy s10 and was pleased to see it has a headphone jack .
 it &apos;s been that way for a long time .
 remember when andrew jackson shot a guy for constantly talking shit about his wife ?
 i can already see future history classes analyzing this like “as the american people felt the loss of their own power and control over their situation ,  they turned towards books ,  movies ,  and television based around superheroes as a form of escapism .
 because they felt like they couldn’t change their own situation ,  it became commonplace to fantasize about those who could .
 since people seem to be freaking out about how “this doesn’t apply to me !
 ” i should clarify that this comment was not intended to be a serious analysis of the 2010s .
 i made this comment because i know my american history class learned about the rise of comic books and superheroes in the 30s and analyzed their rise in popularity for similar reasons .
 that being said ,  if you asked people in the 30s why they like comics ,  i doubt they would tell you it was because they felt hopeless and comic books made them feel powerful .
 they would probably also tell you “comics are cool .
 i’m not trying to say that every person in the world feels hopeless and that’s why they like comics ,  but when we look back on time periods with the full context of where they came from and where they were going ,  it gets easier to assign general themes across the culture of a time period .
 whether you think they’re right or wrong ,  when people in the future see that there was a spike in viewers of superhero movies around the same time as a spike in political insecurity globally ,  they’ll probably draw the same conclusions .
 what are you talking about step bro
 the amount of incest porn has gotten to be so overwhelming that i now question the sincerity of anyone who says they are not into that kind of thing .
  &apos;ewww gross she &apos;s my sister .
  &apos; has lost all meaning to me .
 a small splash of fortnite ,  i don’t like it but it’s popularity is undeniable
 brexit will still be going on for another 68 years .
 that &apos;ll the the introductory line for the cnn documentary of the 2010s
 and still having
 i actually got chased by some of these clowns .
 it was and this comment is probably advertising too tbh
 doesn &apos;t he mean those crazy people who hid in the bushes and then chased you with a knife ?
 that was not advertising
 i can sum 2016 up in one sentence  .
 a clown whips and nae  naes on a hover board while his hype beast friend records for vine while listening to drake and playing pokémon go
 ikr ,  feels like the internet started puberty and we &apos;re still in it
 as of yet ,  it doesn &apos;t seem to bad like people feared it would be .
 countries like france (after the algerian war) and germany (post-ww2-era) had larger streams of refugees before and they were properly integrated even in these tougher times .
 the difference is that these refugees could for the most part fluently speak french/german .
 the political aspect might actually be more impactful .
 without the refugee crisis ,  there would not be such a strong european right wing ,  especially in the east .
 populists and extremists have used refugees as their rallying cry since the first syrians set foot on european soil ,  it &apos;s unlikely they would &apos;ve found a similarly suitable topic .
 in a sense ,  the war in syria and the arabian spring might be responsible for the german afd ,  le pen ,  shitshow in italy ,  brexit debacle and rise of semi-fascist populism in eastern europe .
 the arabian spring will most likely end up as the 10s version of the 1848/9 revolutions in europe .
 i mean ,  look at the countries today ,  almost nothing came of it except hundreds of deaths ,  a libya sunken into chaos and slightly less dictatorial-looking dictators
 the age of monopolies .
 just like a vacuum cleaner nozzle .
 if anything they &apos;re just getting started
 i wonder if there &apos;s an askreddit thread about this same topic from 2009 .
 i graduated highschool in 2009 and have been in college ever since .
 i have a bachelors degree .
 “doomer generation” lmao
 i &apos;ll tell you this ,  2012 was the year the majority of the internet users were on phones ,  and not laptops or desktops ,  so the 2010 &apos;s is def the year where the smartphones changed everything .
 suddenly kids and old people and tech illiterate people came to the internet and it &apos;s changed everything .
 i think the main issue with the lag from 2007 with smartphone adoption was with people needing to be warmed up to both wanting to have a computer in their pockets and to doubling their cell phone bill .
 hell ,  by 2007 there were still a lot of people without cell phones ,  and even more that were paying several cents per text message .
 was a lot to ask for adding a device of questionable utility due to spotty service ,  crappy 2/3g speeds ,  and an internet not yet redesigned for mobile devices .
 android offering some competition and bringing in lower priced smartphones helped a bit ,  but everything just to took time to catch up .
 yes it &apos;s so easy to forget now ,  how cell phones used to be phones and not much more .
 how ironic ,  now ,  that it &apos;s actually annoying when you get an unexpected phone call because it &apos;s probably a fucking spam bot trying to steal your identity .
 i grew up in the 90s and although people had cell phones ,  it was just a wireless phone ,  pagers were where it was at because you could send text to the beeper .
 then of course the 2000s rolled around and the internet became mainstream .
 we all had to learn the computer ,  even our parents and grandparents ,  remember when the younger generation had to teach the older generation about the internet ,  well now look ,  the older generation has caught up ,  they can handle the internet like the rest of us (see facebook and insaneparents) and with mobile i’m able to literally take a shit in my hotel while vacationing in some random mountain town that would have had little to no access to internet 20 years ago .
 it felt like i was actually in the pokemon world .
  everyone was out adventuring and sharing what they caught .
 the excitement of people on the train or in the store .
  it was whimsical !
 i remember walking all the way to liberty state park because it was the only place to find eevee .
 i went several times and each time only found one .
 thank god eggs came along .
 i think overall it has muddied the waters so as to weaken us in the face of those in power .
 it is now a false sense of power with exceptions .
 the sad thing is ,  it really doesn &apos;t give people power ,  it &apos;s the collectiveness of other people &apos;s approval that give them power ,  it &apos;s just opinions at the very simple but people are just so into it that they don &apos;t really have will power for themselves anymore
 the worst thing is it’s a heat sink .
 you can spend all day bitching and moaning about the injustice of the world on social media and it’s just buried a few hours later like it never happened .
 but it made you feel like , you did something ,  you’re exhausted from the mental energy .
 so when it comes time to actually do something besides type on a keyboard ,  you opt out .
 this is the serious problem of social media .
 its goin to be so weird saying  &apos;the 20 &apos;s &apos; .
 peace be upon his name
 my dick is always out for harambe !
 put a totem of undying on the poster .
 or show the respawn or quit thing with the respawn button about to be clicked with the score number being 2019
 members of bush &apos;s re-election team have urged the president to exercise caution with his blog ,  perhaps because of posts like the one dated july 8 ,  2004:  &apos;another long day of speeches and fundraisers .
 met with all these phony media company execs .
 had to promise them some bill next term and shake a lot of stupid hands ,  but they did bring in two or three million or so .
 karl keeps a list .
 i got big laughs during my speech ,  so i &apos;m happy .
 jesus christ ,  dude .
 my favorite is still marijuana overdoses kill 37 in colorado on first day of legalization .
 that got shared all over my social media for like the whole year .
 i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got some bad news for you .
 non american here .
 what &apos;s this a reference to ?
 been to busy with our own politicians being mental to notice your side of the atlantic lately .
 thanks for the replies ,  that &apos;s actually amazing how did he even think that would work and why carry on .
 it &apos;s like a kid having chocolate all over their face saying that they never ate any chocolate
 satire is dead and we sit upon a throne of its corpse .
 yeah ,  i &apos;m not even 30 yet and this freaked me out a bit .
 it &apos;s like my mind skipped a decade as if we &apos;re still in the 2000 &apos;s
 just think ,  30 years before the 90’s was the 60’s .
 i grew up during the90s ,  and for some reason (maybe because y2k was such a big deal ?
 ) ,  i just never really thought past the 2000s when i was a kid .
 like ,  i knew i &apos;ll probably live to 60+ but just never occurred to me that i &apos;ll live through another 20s or 30s .
 they just sound like years in history books to me .
 maybe it &apos;s just me being old ,  but the 50 &apos;s ,  60 &apos;s ,  70 &apos;s and 80 &apos;s each seem like distinctly separate periods .
 the 90s forward feel like one long period .
 the year 1990 will be 30 years ago ,  don &apos;t age us prematurely !
 newspapers have to go digital and they already do .
 every young ,  motivated journalist is heavily needed .
 yeah and you don &apos;t need internet for it
 i also feel like if radio were to become obsolete ,  it wouldn &apos;t take long for it to come back in the form of pirate radio and become popular again similar to vinyl in music terms
 anytime i get nostalgic over the 00s ,  i remind myself of that time when i was 12 and unsure if my dad was alive or not on 9/11/01 .
 then watching us invade a country over non-existent wmds 2 years later .
 and then watching a lot of my friend &apos;s parents lose their jobs in 08 .
 the 00s were an awful fucking time .
 holy crap this blew up !
 since many asked ,  my dad was ok .
 we are from nj but he used to commute to nyc .
 he actually called in sick that day ,  but back then not every kid had a cell phone and cell lines were down on 9/11 anyways .
 so i didn’t know until i got home from school that he was fine .
 i feel horrible for not remembering the exact number but iirc 4-5 kids from my middle school lost a parent .
 i feel like i’m already nostalgic for the 2010’s .
 it’s when i graduated high school ,  went through college and graduated ,  got married ,  bought a house .
 lots of good memories .
 i feel like it’ll be all downhill in the 20s ,  so i’ll continue to look back fondly .
 in the us ,  at least ,  it &apos;s easier to see eras as presidential administrations than as calendar decades (helps with what to call the early 2000s ,  too) .
 bush ,  obama ,  and trump have all felt like distinct epochs .
 the era of cowboy movies has lasted longer than the era of cowboys
 cowboy movies are still kick ass .
 that’s a good point and it probably has a lot to due with the growing wealth gap .
 wealthy people in cities can afford to dine out at pricy local restaurants and bars ,  while poorer rural and suburban people can afford cheap chains and fast food .
 that’s why dollar general is one of the fastest growing chains ,  they’re banking on the growing level of poverty .
 and grey everywhere else in the house .
 a move away from chain restaurants was so desperately needed for the enjoyment of all (all who can handle differences and/or change at least) .
 what an improvement and leap forward !
 touch screens in cars are an awful idea .
 with a knob or dial to change the temperature or adjust the radio - you &apos;re fine .
 you can do that without looking and you know what you &apos;re doing .
 a touchscreen has none of that - if you want to adjust anything while driving you have to take your eyes off the road .
 i had a rental car with a touchscreen and it felt very unsafe .
 and when driving at night the brightness from the screen was not pleasant .
 long live knob and dial
 was gonna say that .
 like they just literally locked people away or cut their brains a half century ago .
 pretty sure we’re making progress
 half the people i know are counting  &apos;spoons &apos; in terms of how many things they can accomplish in a day .
 we did it reddit !
 i found the guy who did the boston bombing you guys get the fbi in here
 it &apos;s not new ,  but the way its evolved with social media is significant .
 we actually have one in my unit and we’re currently deployed .
 not sure how old you have to be to join the army ,  but it will be 18 years ago in 3 days
 it &apos;s almost over .
 i &apos;m sure of it this time guys i swear
 i didn &apos;t start partying until the mid 2010s and my only regret in life is that i never got to party rock in the house tonight when i had the chance .
 lmfao - party rock anthem .
 jennifer lopez and pitbull - on the floor .
 enrique iglesias - tonight i’m lovin you .
 chris brown and lil wayne - look at me now .
 wiz khalifa - black and yellow .
 kesha - we r who we are .
 kanye west - all of the lights .
 diddy - hello ,  good morning .
 cobra starship - you make me feel .
 far east movement - like a g6 .
 avicii - levels .
 deadmau5 - all of for lack of a better name and 4x4=12 .
 good times first year of college in 2011
 i actually miss lmfao a bit .
 their first album was  &apos;ugh ,  what ?
 are those guys for real ?
  &apos; ,  but the 2nd album hit the perfect spot between sincere douchebaggery and  &apos;don &apos;t worry ,  we &apos;re just kidding !
 also from viral videos you’d understand to surreal meme humor
 at the rate memes are evolving ,  the meme wars will begin waaaay sooner than 2028
 memes became more sophisticated .
 that might be a stretch .
 i truly believe harambe &apos;s death is what triggered a butterfly-effect of events which lead to this weird ass timeline we are currently in .
 those are the two options
 works well in politics too .
 the scary thing is that all the people behind these marketing campaigns are people in their late 20 &apos;s and mid 30 &apos;s .
 social media marketing and marketing in general is an industry populated by those directly affected by this decade : they &apos;ve been educated in it ,  they &apos;ve worked in it ,  they are the primary consumers of it &apos;s goods .
 in my very large corporation ,  marketing is demographically the youngest department in the company .
 their job is to engineer attention on our media platforms .
 they are the ones coming up with all this outrage to attract attention .
 we all know how boomers fucked things up .
 this is going to be the millennial legacy of fucking things up .
 hence the rise of the first world problem phenomenon .
 as someone who was born in canada but has a lot of friends who came from out of the country ,  i agree 100% .
 i go to work and hear my co workers bitch about how terrible this country is and how the cops are lazy and need to be fired and how teachers make too much money and how they are wasting tax money and  &apos;something needs to be done &apos; and how ridiculous it is that we have to clean the plastic before recycling it and just .
 wah wah wah wah wah wah .
 drives me crazy .
 people don &apos;t understand how good it is here .
 im thankful everyday that i was born here lol .
 they also banned anime as a result ,  which caused weebs to flood the streets of washington ,  waifu body pillows in hand ,  and shinzo abe to publicly cut all ties with the united states .
 no one could have predicted the butterfly effect of what ensued following the area 51 raid .
 this will be in history books .
 if we survive that long under our new alien overlords .
 on the bright side ,  the aliens disguised as humans finally revealed their identities as a result .
 elon musk was no surprise ,  but i think we can all agree no one was expecting todd howard to be one ,  opening up a lot of questions about the true nature of skyrim .
 while chomping on a cigar .
 the 1910 &apos;s were also widely regarded as a bad move
 and hopefully not the prohibition thing either
 when did the fedora become acceptable again ?
 so you &apos;re saying you can &apos;t see 2020 ?
 how thick are your glasses ?
 i know its a meme at this point ,  but that first month of pokemon go was the closest i &apos;ve seen this nation since 9/11 .
 i &apos;ve been on reddit 7 years and it &apos;s my first gold .
 thank you ,  stranger .
 surprised to see ai this far down .
 it may just be machine learning and if statements for now ,  but we already have deep fakes and mostly autonomous driving .
 if the trend continues ,  ai will have a huge impact on society and we will see the 2010s as the dawn of it all .
 i agree with the premise but i don &apos;t think andrew jackson needed politics to want to shoot a guy .
 remember when andrew jackson .
 found the time traveler
 i mean that &apos;s basically the same reason superhero comics became popular back in the 30s .
 i swear to god that somewhere here on reddit i saw  &apos;twin step sister &apos; .
  &apos;i hope mom and dad don &apos;t find out !
 for me its the semi-professional nature of the production .
 it &apos;s not as plastic and fake as brazzers but not as shit as the amature porn that it &apos;s emulating .
 personally i just skip the bad acting of the first 5 minutes
 humanity will be eradicated before brexit ends .
 me and my friends went clown hunting in middle school lmao
 yea i &apos;ve been seeing obnoxious amounts of it related stuff on reddit tge past few days
  &apos;i wonder if there &apos;s an askreddit thread about this same topic from 2019 .
  &apos;  says a reddit post from 2029
 boomers to doomers to zoomers
 in my field the prevalence of mobile devices vs computers is dictated by their use .
 shopping online is a 60/40 split from my ecommerce clients ,  while laboratory clients use desktops for everything .
 i don &apos;t think desktop is ever going to die for one reason .
 the screen is huge and not everything will look good or work well on a 4-6 inch screen 1/3 of which is keyboard space .
 plus desktops are always going to be more powerful compared to mobile because you can always fit more transistors inside a desktop vs a mobile device .
 if i &apos;m working and my desktop shaves 1 second off of every click ,  by the end of the day i &apos;ve saved hours of time not waiting for things to load .
 i tell you what ,  the community was the real miracle in that game .
  now if only they &apos;d done a better job at keeping peoples &apos; interest .
 i still don &apos;t get how the original distance tracking feature broke ,  or why it &apos;s taken going on four years to add a few hundred pokemon .
  the models already exist !
 there was something surreal about that time .
 you could just walk up to strangers and talk ,  the whole street was filled with people all doing the exact same thing without any organised event .
 my brother ,  sister ,  a few friends and i would all drive around slowly in the back streets with pokestops and slow down with our windows down past any groups of people walking with their phones out blasting the pokémon theme ,  trying to look all gangsta .
 we’d ask what team they were in and if they weren’t ours we’d speed off .
 was always fun seeing people’s reactions lol .
 first group growing up to have a proper decade since the 90s .
 i kind of hope that pinstripe suits and flapper dresses make a comeback .
 i &apos;m just happy that i finally get to live in a decade with an easily pronouncable name .
 same @\_qz\_ #fucksocialmedia #socialmediaimplosion whlie it implodes follow me on instagram @socialimplosion and twitter @socialimplocial and be sure to like my fb page i &apos;ll be posting this comment about social media being shit on there  &apos;social media implsoin mems &apos;
 my mom shared this and she was adamant that it was true .
 she wouldn &apos;t even read the front page of the website which says it &apos;s satire
 pappa donnie &apos;s going to make everything ok .
 i mean ,  he scared the hurricane from approaching alabama .
 that &apos;s why it turned north and totally didn &apos;t even head in the direction of the gulf .
 our president ,  after being mistaken that the hurricane going on in the southern states would hit alabama ,  is doubling down ,  saying that he was not wrong .
 that feeling never stops as you grow older .
 you understand the meaning of  &apos;it feels like yesterday &apos; .
 fucking hell i realized my ass may or may not make it 2090s ,  being born in the year 2000 sucks .
 nirvana’s nevermind album was released closer in time to the first moon landing than to today .

 i &apos;m 47 and i &apos;m right there with you all .
 and you know what ,  other than those random days when i wake up injured for no damn reason ,  getting old while riding this crazy ball of dirt is a lot of fun .
 some days you &apos;ll eat the bear ,  and some days it will eat you .
 just roll with it man .
 and thanks for the gold !
 i was born in  &apos;74 ,  so i thought for sure that by 2020 ,  we &apos;d be living like the jetsons up in here .
 see ,  i think that sometimes but then i look at music videos from those years and realise that yeah ,  they were different .
 maybe time &apos;so just going faster .
 like 2002 feels like a different era than like 2009 .
 and 2013 feels like a different era too ,  but that doesn &apos;t seem to different from today other than the memes ,  maybe the music .
 politically though it &apos;s a completely different ballpark .
 i don &apos;t know if any of that made sense but oh well
 i turned 30 this year and reading this made me question what year i was born in .
 the 80s were 30 years ago !
 radio is like the wood-burning fireplace of modern communication .
 it will always exist among a subset of the population .
 plus aux ports and bluetooth in cars weren &apos;t invented until around  &apos;05 so there &apos;s going to be a number of people out there dependent on the radio (or cds) .
 average age of a car on the road right now is 11 .
 8 years (2007) so almost half of vehicles now don &apos;t have access to the two options in newer vehicles .
 ah i see you’re a man of culture functioning member of society as well
 90s nostalgia makes sense to me because it was the only decade between the cold war and the forever war .
 it was just a relatively chill time in america .
 but the early 00s sucked at least as much as the last few years have .
 pop culture was atrocious and the news depressing/enraging as hell .
 don &apos;t forget the devastation that was katrina .
 i &apos;ve noticed humans tend to do that .
 i recall in latin class ,  we would read a lot of historical texts describing time in terms of who was emperor or consul ,  and even to this day ,  i know at least japan defines its calendar eras in terms of who &apos;s emperor at the time .
 that &apos;s crazy that she couldn &apos;t even sell 36 t shirts ,  but the end of the article kind of explains where she went wrong .
  seems like she just didn &apos;t put much effort into it .
  a lot of them think their shit is gold and 2 million followers=all they need ,  but a minority of them know their followers ,  and understand how to make a brand and market it properly .
 i saw an analysis of that situation and that  &apos;influencer &apos; is clearly a fake influencer who just purchased a ton of bots to follow them so it &apos;s not surprising that that didn &apos;t convert into merch sales .
 theres a bit of irony here as well ,  where her post says that she got some friends to model and then just says  &apos;s/o to y &apos;all too &apos; instead of actually giving them credit for modeling .
 isnt that the usual /r/choosingbeggars way of asking for stuff without paying is by offering a shout out and exposure ,  while not even giving them a proper shout out ?
 what a coincidence ,  the era of superhero movies has also lasted longer than the era of real superheroes
 someone should make an old western style movie where the town is full of mundane superheros .
 i don &apos;t think anyone is arguing against that .
 oh goddamnit now i want a “once upon a time in hollywood” set in the future where the mcu has become the equivalent of spaghetti westerns
 i &apos;m canada the dollar store chain dollarama is doing very well for similar reasons ,  good selection of products (that mostly don &apos;t suck) at cheap prices ,  including food ,  really appeals to people on a budget .
 also i &apos;ve been seeing more and more subways ,  they really seem to be getting almost oversaturated .
 at least in bc .
 i never liked how  &apos;shiny &apos; those style of icons looked .
 it felt fake and uncanny ,  and too flashy .
 although i also have never owned and barely used an ipod or iphone .
 always been a fan of more minimalist icons personally anyway .
 mine are mostly replaced with an icon outline pack on android .
 still colourful ,  but they look less out of place .
 personally ,  i think it &apos;s a mixed bag .
 taking the comparison of the icons you linked:   .
 i think the flat is noticeably better for: .
 the camera (the old icon was worthless) .
 ibooks (just a style preference; the skeumorphic one was also ok) .
 but the flat ones are worse in my opinion for: .
 weather (important temperature info dropped) .
 passbook (now full of tiny unreadable nonsense instead of obvious tickets) .
 game center (how on earth are blobby circles supposed to invoke  &apos;games &apos; in my mind ?
 newstand (now just has a cluttered wad of junk) .
 and slightly worse for reminders (the old checkmarks clearly make you think of a to-do list ,  while the new  &apos;squished pastel traffic light &apos; is kind of abstract and vague) .
 some are fairly terrible in both incarnations: .
 photos (neither one makes you immediately think  &apos;click here for pictures &apos; ,  though the flat  &apos;old-school  &apos;nbc peacock &apos; in a tornado &apos; one is marginally better than the  &apos;look !
 a random flower !
  &apos; skeumorphic one) .
 app store (the weird assemblage of rulers and pencils into an uppercase  &apos;a &apos; has always struck me as confusing and pretentious and it &apos;s a little surprising they carried it through into the world of flat) .
 every other icon is basically the exact same except that it doesn &apos;t have the rounded shiny chiclet look .
 rather than regarding that as some revolutionary usability statement ,  i just consider it the ui equivalent of  &apos;this season hemlines are two inches longer than last year and designers are putting more teal and charcoal accents into your wardrobe .
  ,  it &apos;s just fashion .
  and like all fashion ,  its primary dual purpose is simply to (a) make the owner of the new fashion feel like he/she has something new and fresh ,  and (b) make those with last year &apos;s fashion feel inferior and a little second-class or uncool -- better spend some more money to become cool again !
 of course ,  with uis you no longer have to pay for your fashion upgrades .
 well ,  you may pay with your time if they made something  &apos;super-cool and stylish !
  &apos; that doesn &apos;t work the way it used to ,  so now you have to re-learn  &apos;remember  &apos;blobby circles &apos; equals  &apos;games &apos; now; remember swipe left with three fingers then press-and hold to accomplish what you used to do by flipping a skeumorphic lever that has now been removed because it was  &apos;uncool &apos; &apos; .
 where flat design has really failed us is the complete obscuration of the difference between  &apos;label &apos; and  &apos;controller &apos; .
 now everyone has to look at every piece of text as potentially a  &apos;multi-purpose knob of unknown usage &apos; upon which you must first click ,  then click and swipe ,  then double click ,  then 3d-touch ,  then push-and-hold .
  i knew there had to be a way to do that !
  i only had to poke around for 3 minutes to find it .
 i find out new stuff all the time on my iphone whenever i accidentally touch or swipe or drag something or set the phone down or turn it sideways or catch my thumb on something when i &apos;m talking to somebody .
 of course sometimes it might take me another three minutes to figure out how to undo whatever i accidentally just did .
  but it &apos;s all in the service of making advanced functionality invisible so that the interface stays  &apos;pretty &apos; more than  &apos;intuitively useful .
 so will people tire of this style ?
 we now have phones ,  tablets ,  and laptops with skazillion pixel screens ,  but we &apos;re not allowed to create information-dense visual interfaces because that would be a sin .
  and lord jony has told us not to sin .
 all praise be to sparse ,  context-information-free screens .
  aren &apos;t they pretty ?
 i &apos;m trying to understand this please help
 this guy’s life is ruined forever because of one small mistake !
 i just realized none of our kids ,  one of whom is 18 ,  have lived in a country that was not at war .
 once the last of the islamic rebels are sorted you have act ii the kurdish hold .
 then once that it is finished you have act iii where turkey decides they held their buffer zone land for so long it &apos;s just sorta theirs now .
 how tf you gonna write all this and not put in dynamite by taio cruz
 reading this makes me realise that i’ve been old for at least a decade .
  i recognise the names of 2 songs ,  and could hum one of them .

 try like three years ago .
 memes are already a form of political warfare at this point .
 more sophisticated in the sense that you can show anyone in the world a 2010 meme like bad luck brian and they’ll at least understand it’s supposed to be a joke .
 some memes nowadays are like 8 iterations deep and if you haven’t been following them then they make absolutely no sense .
 you’re probably still right .
 more complicated maybe ?
 you know how in time travel scenarios the good guy can just throw a rock somewhere and due to butterfly effects a disaster is stopped ?
 well ,  i think we have ourselves an evil time traveller
 damn you guys are spot on .
 speaking some serious truth here

 the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand was not ,  as it turns out ,  a  &apos;pro gamer move &apos; .
 dark comment but yeah so true .
 i saw people of all ages ,  races and tax brackets bonding over that stupid fucking app that basically did nothing .
 walking around at night even felt safe because there were people everywhere .
 they just didn &apos;t handle it properly .
 everyone was playing and it could &apos;ve been a huge thing .
 now there is more content but getting back into it is hard .
 too many requirements and things to keep track of; raids ,  friends ,  tasks etc .
 andrew jackson regularly shot people in duels for fun and had a known penchant for hanging people too ,  the guy just liked killing

 you literally cannot escape advertising now .
 the worst is when you &apos;re listening to music ,  with headphones ,  on soundcloud and then all of a sudden you just hear an advert .
 “things will probably just keep getting worse until the boomers die .
 i don’t have much hope for the next ten years .
 i love this so much .
 op is talking to himself for half the thread .
 funny that facebook youtube and twitter are seen as accomplishments there .
 i love that almost nobody in that thread is actually answering the question
 you skipped gen x there .
 born 99 ,  i don &apos;t know anyone my age who had a smartphone as their first mobile phone .
 everyone had flip phones and the slidey ones .
 nokia and sony ericsson mainly ,  of course .
 i love my desktop ,  my phone is like a necessary pain in the ass .
 go was undeniably massive but fizzled out so quickly because of its reliance on the pokémon branding and great concept; with how janky the game was at release ,  i doubt many people would’ve given the game much of a chance without pokémon .
 it sounds like the game is pretty good now ,  but it’s far too late to recuperate it’s momentary success .
 and given that not every pokémon will be in the upcoming sword/shield ,  those existing models don’t seem to be keen on actually being used .
 surreal perfectly describes my experience with pokemon go .
 i was working at a bar near the beach at the time people got into it .
 normally ,  getting out of work at 3am ,  no one was one the streets .
 the first week or two it took off ,  there were dozens of people across the street on the boardwalk just staring at their phones ,  standing in silent huddled masses .
 the police showed up for a night or two to figure out what was going on and figured out it was all peaceful nerdom .
 the next few weeks consisted of dozens of people in a confined area ,  post 2am with no sounds but the waves crashing on shore .
 truly the weirdest experience ,  having to make your way through living mannequins to get home .
 i miss when people would say things like “get with the times ,  it’s the 90s”
 its going to be a decade of people hosting  &apos;roaring 20s &apos; theme parties .
 hopefully with no  &apos;great depression &apos; followed by prohibition .
 let &apos;s be the change we want to be .
 let &apos;s being that shit back
 fedoras have been ruined beyond repair tho
 i’ve been looking forward to it since the millennium .
 what about showing phones imploding in a tiktok ?
 i always think it is funny when people ask about how pot has changed colorado .
 as a coloradan who voted for the amendment 64 ,  it didn &apos;t change much in anybody &apos;s day to day life .
 people always say it brought tons of people here ,  but that was happening before 64 .
 you think 10 , 000 people move to denver every year from out of state just so they can smoke weed ?
 no ,  its because we are an awesome state with lots of jobs ,  a healthy economy ,  and progressive leadership brings in young people .
 well ,  duh ,  if you threaten a hurricane with a nuke ,  what &apos;s a hurricane to do ?
 just be the big man and let it slide ,  go pound some other nations/islands .
 holy fucking shit .
 i just cracked .
 it &apos;s all just funny to me now .
 we live in a goddamn comedy show .
 this is what a child does are you fkn kidding me .
 i can &apos;t stop giggling .
 you got a 12 year head start on me bro .
 i’m determined to see the year 2100 ,  but i’d have to live to be 112 .
 they do say the first person who will live to 150 is alive today though .
 you shut your whore mouth
 as someone born to teen parents 1976 ,  i never thought i &apos;d ever survive to see 2020 .
 i think everything post iphone is blended into one long “social media age” .
 i assure you we had aux ports well before 2005 .
 i had one in my 2003 panasonic radio in my sentra .
 also the first bluetooth enabled cars was in 2000 ,  by chrysler .
 dude ,  the forever war is a badass name for real .
 is that what people are actually calling the current state of things ?
 it &apos;s like sci-fi .
 i &apos;m following them for their bikini pics .
 tbh if they &apos;re selling something ,  i &apos;ll usually skip those stories .
 except when they &apos;re wearing a bikini - when i &apos;d watch it in mute .
 surprised advertisers didn &apos;t realize that .
 if i buy followers and then sell to the followers i bought i can buy more followers to sell to !
 hello ,  this is netflix ,  you &apos;re greenlit
 the growth of subways is largely immigrant driven .
 subways require a quarter of the space of a tim hortons or mcdonalds and are much cheaper to franchise .
 they make a reliable option for immigrants looking to break into business ownership here .
 as for them being anywhere ,  subway is much less selective/restrictive than other franchises for location .
 i’m not sure if this is what they meant ,  but in chronic pain community’s they often use the spoon theory .
 which is like how much energy you have is measured in spoons ,  and it takes a certain amount of spoons to do certain tasks .
 like you have 20 spoons for the day ,  and showering takes 5 .
  sometimes people describe complete exhaustion ,  as having ‘run out of spoons’ i never thought about it before ,  but i suppose the spoon theory could be applied to mental health problems ,  especially anxiety .
 1 spoon = an amount of physical ,  mental and emotional energy expended by doing daily activities .
 so like imagine  &apos;i spent most of my spoons getting to and from downtown in my wheel chair &apos; or in mental health terms  &apos;my visit to my therapist used up all my spoons all i want to do is go home and watch tv &apos; .
  &apos;i don &apos;t have the spoons to explain my disability to one more stranger online so i just deactivated facebook &apos; .
 i kinda understand as i have really bad anxiety ,  but i &apos;m also from an older generation where we keep going until we fall appart .
 it always cracks me up when i see people new to the site who dont know about that revving up for the flavor of the month witch hunt ,  and by cracks me me up i mean makes me hate the internet .
 they were recruited by the nsa and fired the weapon that killed osama bin laden .
 well it could be worse we could be having ww3 .
 wait it’s standing right behind me isn’t it ?
 it &apos;s going to be a long ,  long war
 i went to a lmfao concert in college .
 when wiggle came on some scrawny little kid that was wrecked/rolling stripped down to a shiny silver speedo and pushed his way through the crowd to get to the front and accidently elbowed a girl in the face trying to get by .
 the security tried to bounce him as he tried to hop over the gate (i will never forget the hopeless look in his face) and redfoo saw it and called him up on stage .
 let me tell you this pale-ass scrawny little fuck danced his junk off on that stage and the crowd was nuts .
 turned out he didn &apos;t even go to the school .
 the bummer was sky blu wasn &apos;t there because he was sick or something .
 hi ,  thanks for checking in .
 #still a piece of garbage
 begun ,  the meme wars have
 yeah memes on /r9k/ and /pol/ played a huge part on trump gaining publicity during the election .
 i have to say i can see where sophistication has come into play .
 if memes were likened to jokes ,  older simpler memes like bad luck brian are like why &apos;d the chicken cross the road ?
 newer memes ,  in my opinion ,  have gotten much more sophisticated .
 not necessarily in that they are always thought provoking ,  but because new memes are like having an inside joke .
 it &apos;s usually a reference to pop culture ,  or outdated but fond pop culture ,  or a person who is easily recognizable ,  but if you aren &apos;t in on the joke ,  it could be lost on you .
 but with the help of the internet ,  anyone interested in knowing more about or understanding the joke can find it ,  making it a very new and complex style of joke .
  &apos;getting it &apos; makes the joke so much funnier ,  and that &apos;s why we seem to have developed weirdly specific obsessions with obscure memes .
 the harder it is to  &apos;get it ,  &apos; the funnier is is .
 thank you for coming to my ted talk .
 this made me actually laugh .
 i haven’t seen this one in awhile
 here we are ,  raging against the bankers and politicians and other small fish ,  meanwhile giantjellyfishattacks &apos;s coworkers have the guts to go after the real fatcats .
 you &apos;re finally awake .
 you were trying to take the direct flight to japan ,  right ?
 walked right into that cavity search ,  same as us ,  and that weeb over there .
 like the things that were poppular in 1995 ?
 pogs and slammers ?
 i could get down with this .
 i still have my pogs ,  but my mom got rid of hers .
 she worked at a pog shop in the 90s ,  and had like ,  thousands of them .
 she got as many as she wanted ,  for free !
 i have a few hundred ,  because i had to pay .
 i can &apos;t wait to start a crowdfunded ,  bit-coin craft beer underground network !
 it was fucking magical .
 too bad there weren &apos;t battles or anything to keep it going :(
 oh man here i go killing again
 see the turtle ,  ain’t he keen ?
 all things serve the fuckin’ beam .
 the wheel weaves as the wheel wills .
 we will have the second big bang before brexit ends ,  and then we find out we all are in a gif ,  and that &apos;s the beginning of the loop .
 i dont think so .
 people have always been kinda shitty to a certain extent and i have faith for my generation ,  but we have to stay rational .
 the 70s were also more liberal and eco friendly ,  and you see how well that continued in the 80s ,  90s etc .
 these former hippies are part of the boomer generation you generalize right now
 i love how every thing seemed normal ,  then op started ranting about israel in an answer to a comment
 to be fair ,  it wasn &apos;t really much of a question so much as op complaining about how how that decade sucked
 nobody i know who still plays go uses the sound ,  apparently ever since an update a while ago all the sound in the game sounds super shitty and compressed like an old newgrounds video .
 there may be people alive today who will be saying that again in 80 years .
 (hello from 2019 if you &apos;re reading this then)
 i can live with that .
 and with any luck i &apos;ll be dead by the time we get back to the 70s .
 i’m gonna have a rawring 20s party where we all dress like scene kids and listen to brokencyde
 what if we see a baby bust by the 2040s with so many adults not wanting to have kids .
 it &apos;s like the reverse
 the new great depression is that everyone is just very depressed
 then only 20 more years until zoot suits return !
 the future &apos;s unsettled and nobody knows -   .
 wherever we &apos;re headed or just how it goes .
 we build for tomorrow as well as we can -   .
 for no one is certain .
 but i have a plan .
 i &apos;m yearnin &apos; ,  returnin &apos; to previous roots -   .
 i &apos;m dancin &apos; to jazz and i &apos;m preppin &apos; my suits -   .
 i &apos;m rarin &apos; ,  preparin &apos; for sharin &apos; and then -   .
 i &apos;m bringin &apos; the roar of the  &apos;twenties again .
 true ,  but whipping out your tommy gun in a dark alley just doesn &apos;t look right without one .
 fedoras without a suit have been ruined .
 the hat that people picture when you say  &apos;fedora &apos; (or  &apos;m &apos;lady &apos; for that matter) is actually a trilby ,  which has a very narrow brim .
 even when wearing a suit a trilby looks somewhat ridiculous unless you live somewhere tropical .
 a proper fedora has a brim that &apos;s about 3 &apos; wide and should match the suit .
 even in those circumstances the cut of the suit matters .
 english cut (tight fit and typically 2-button) suits are in style and tend not to look good with a hat at all .
 there is some hope for proper hats in general though .
 the ascot cap has been acceptable casual wear for a few years now ,  especially in the fall and winter .
 this has been great for guys who hate baseball caps but also don &apos;t have a waifu/don &apos;t study the blade .
 well it was the  &apos;oughts &apos; until 2010 ,  then it was just the  &apos;whatever the hell we &apos;re doing &apos; decade .
 oughts wasn &apos;t nearly as bad .
 aaannnndd you can smoke weed without having to worry about the cops .
 i was actually at a party with two girls a few years back .
 they had witnessed some sort of crime and were filling out police reports at the party and called the cop when they were done .
 the cops showed up while the living room was being hot boxed .
 they got their papers and said make sure you guys don &apos;t let any minors in here .
 then they left without even identifying  a single person .
 it was so weird because my brain still wanted me to run out of the back door and escape .
 if the hurricane doesn’t hit alabama in 15 minutes they’re legally allowed to leave .
 it won &apos;t be funny when alabama homes are destroyed by the hurricane because of his careless drawing !
 if that 70s show was rebooted today it would be set in 1997
 the future is now old man .
 you put those goddamn numbers away right now
 don’t get too ahead of yourself ,  we’re not there yet !
 the white suit looks pimp af ,  the rest just look .
 the ages are changing so fast now ,  that it seems like it &apos;s just the age of change .
 true ,  but there are things that have come and gone .
  the age of rage comics and advice animals were great times to be alive .
 this is a great point and i think one reason is because it allows us to consume all pop culture ,  regardless of era .
 there are still iconic songs that will last from this era but now on a whim we can hop into any era or genre of the past 70+ years .
 all of this probably creates a cultural blur .
 the forever war is a book by joe haldeman ,  it &apos;s fantastic you should check it out .
 the reiwa period began in april 2019 ,  with the abdication of akihito to naruhito .
 prior to that was the heisei era ,  which started in january 1989 ,  and prior to that was the showa era ,  the reign of emperor showa (known in life as hirohito) ,  the emperor during wwii .
 added extra info now that i &apos;m not on a mobile phone .
  i guess that &apos;s the difference .
  there are the ones that are just hot girls being followed because they &apos;re hot .
  then there are the ones that are more blog like that actually have an audience that likes their content .
  the former is pretty worthless to advertisers while the latter could definitely make sense for advertisers .
 but you &apos;ll be canceled after one season and on a cliffhanger .
 season one was awesome ,  have another !
 season two was twice as awesome !
 don &apos;t call us ,  we &apos;ll call you .
 wow i &apos;ve never seen this or any other metaphor to explain it .
 i &apos;ve always told my family and friends that it feels like i am a sports character on a video game with the set amount of sprint bar your dude has and once it &apos;s out in a day i &apos;m sleep on the floor tired ,  whether that runs out in 4 hours or in 30 .
 i kinda understand as i have really bad anxiety ,  but i &apos;m also from an older generation where we keep going until we fall appart .
 that &apos;s where the whiskey comes in .
 it allows you to take from your future health to accomplish today &apos;s tasks .
 ww3 would take a resource disaster or iran/israel fucking up really bad to happen so i think we are good for at least another decade
 the sun is a deadly lazer
 vine did more for human unity online than most other things
 say racist things on reddit i must ,  promised me ketamine ,  the russians have
 that was captivating af .
 i remember pogs ,  but i don &apos;t remember such thing as a pog shop .
 i wonder how long the last pog shop stayed in business .
 i wonder if there are pog shops in williamsburg reviving the obscure trend from 1995 .
 i wonder if someone is still paying off their business loan that was used to start a pog shop .
 they probably just declared bankruptcy .
 the pog shop business is tough .
 i probably wouldn &apos;t recommend getting in to it .
 not these days anyways .
 new cryptocurrency; beercoin .
 i &apos;m in australia and it &apos;s definitely making a come back .
 baby boomers are people born from around 1946 to 1964 .
 generation x is from around 1965 to 1980 .
 millenials ,  or generation y ,  is from around 1981 to 1996 .
 generation z is from around 1997 to 2012 .
 (although where gen z starts and ends is a bit more up in the air atm)
 i still see people playing it all the time on the bus .
 i used to play it ,  but the phone i was using had its screen get broken and i &apos;ve been using an old phone for a long time and it &apos;s a piece of shit .
 my entire family played together when it first came out .
 we were going on pokemon walks and it was really fun .
 we all started dropping out one by one ,  but you know who still plays it ?
 she still goes to the pokestop near our house whenever she &apos;s walking our dog .
 put me in the screenshot future !
 someone set a remind me bot for 80 years
 we all might be dead if we have to go through the 40 &apos;s again .
  please pick a different  band from the scene kid era .
  like any other band would do .
 well ,  we did have that big band swing craze back in the late 90 &apos;s ,  early  &apos;00s .
 i think i gave my suit to goodwill a few years back though .
 we’ll do it with ten gallon hats instead this time around .
 spice up a classic .
 your username does not coincide with your comment ,  which ,  although interesting and factual is absolutely not obvious .
 it &apos;s literally impossible to pull off a dress hat unless you look like a model .
  it only worked a century ago because literally everybody wore one .
  that will most likely never happen again ,  because ultimately hats are more of a hassle than they are worth to most people .
 the ascot cap has always been worn by a few people here and there for a very long time now .
  you can see pics of people wearing them in the 90 &apos;s .
 oh thank god i can finally leave this shit hole state .
 it &apos;s not even funny right now that &apos;s the problem .
 this motherfucking clown broke me
 if they wait a couple years the series could start just like the 70s version: with the characters going to see star wars .
 i &apos;d watch it tbh .
 calmly curls into ball .
 they don &apos;t think it be like it is but it do .
 if you look closely those pants are measured in iphones just so todays youth know how long they really were .
 baggy pants are back in with the kids ,  check out any skate brands .
 no they aren &apos;t jjnco baggy but a more loose fit is in .
 meanwhile i remember being a  &apos;skate rat &apos; for wearing tight ass krew jeans in 07
 i simply can &apos;t believe we used to wear those .
 maybe there will be new distinctions that we can &apos;t really pinpoint now ,  but once we look back it &apos;ll be obvious .
 i haven’t thought about a “u mad bro !
 ” meme in years .
 wow ,  what a rush .
 there is a non fiction book by the same name about the war on terror .
 the book by haldeman is great .
 on a netflix series ?
 it will be after the season 2 cliffhanger .
 this last decade flew by quickly enough .
 i &apos;d like to believe we &apos;ve got longer than that .
 you could make a religion out of this !
 100 vines that butter my croissant

 well ,  back in 1995 malls were still popular and profitable .
 so the pog shop was just this little popup kiosk on wheels ,  and it sat in front of the video game store .
 (which would now be called gamestop if that mall still existed ,  but back then it was called babbages) .
 as soon as the fad died ,  so did that kiosk .
 the weirdest for me is that my sister and i are born far enough apart for me to be a millennial and my sister a gen z ,  despite coming from the same familial generation
 i still play it casually .
 i started before it was officially released in my country ,  almost at start .
 i &apos;m still not level 40 though :)
 to those who will come after us ,  and read our words with reverence for the past ,  i tell you: .
 you &apos;re now breathing in manual mode .
 well we (almost) got through the 10s without a spanish flu epidemic or a world war so there is hope .
 does hollywood undead count ?
 we all agreed to never speak of that again .
 do you think eric would have sex with his girlfriend while wearing a jar jar mask ?
 i &apos;ve said it before ,  but you get the original cast back as the parents and make it a sequel series and i &apos;d watch the shit out of it .
 go to yugoslavia ,  i cannot .
 war crimes ,  committed i have .
 part of it are the cultural influences during critical points in your upbringing .
 gen x knew a world before the internet .
 gen y had it in high schools .
 gen z onwards have never known life without pervasive electronics .
 measles is back though
 still better than brokencyde
 but i love big bad voodoo daddy
 one can only hope .
 fez’s child spends one summer in his dads homeland and inexplicably has the same accent as dad when he comes back .
 as long as we get grandma kitty ,  i’ll be happy .
 omg where &apos;s a petition for this ?
 time to conquer all of india .
 or most of india
 and this time ,  it &apos;s personal
 measles 2: anti vaxx boogaloo
 ah yes the beautiful mystery island fez is from .
 or hed be the cool kid ladies man ,  and hide &apos;s kid would be the dorky nice guy .
 i love that one episode where fez has a friend from his home country visit ,  and the guy has a british accent lmao
 fun fact his name is fes for foreign exchange student ,  they still won &apos;t tell us what country his son will be from
 \annoying laughter intensifies\
 i love all of you .
  &apos;i work at a hospital ,  and go to covid floors on a regular basis .
 it &apos;s more for your benefit than mine .
  &apos; it &apos;s true and unsurprisingly shuts up even the most ignorant of people .
 i &apos;m a covid icu nurse .
 i find it funny when people say something like this .
 then when i inform them of where i work ,  i suddenly have at least six feet all around me and people are staring at me in shock or horror .
 but ,  you do what you can to keep yourself and your family safe .
 dont worry about the others .
 if they don &apos;t pay your bills or snuggle up to you at night ,  why does their opinion matter anyway ?
 if anyone ever said anything to me ,  i would probably just laugh at them .
 my mask even says the immune disease i have on it ,  just for that one purpose .
 to keep people for giving me shit .
 saying that ,  i mostly stay home ,  i do no contact shopping ,  and doctor &apos;s appointments .
 i &apos;ll not let anyone make me feel badly for protecting myself or my family .
 we just lost my aunt today to covid complications ,  so i would probably ask if they have lost anyone to covid and if they said no ,  i &apos;d tell them to shove their mocking up their .
 i live in rural indiana and hardly anyone wears a mask or distances .
 i go about life the same way i always do honestly ,  stay in as much as possible and when i &apos;m out i pretend they don &apos;t exist .
 when i do get snide comments i just ignore them and carry on with my day .
 a friend of mine kept saying it was a hoax ,  overblown ,  no worse than the flu etc .
 he was hospitalized for a week and been out for almost a month now and still can’t breathe right
 i’ve done thanksgiving for years .
 this year ,  it’s my husband ,  me and my elderly mother minus the 8-10 more we usually have .
 somehow ,  i’m the overreacting asshole for keeping my mother safe .
 hoping it will make them appreciate once we can go back to me cooking like a crazy person ,  but i’m not holding my breath .
 i embraced a long time ago that everyone else thinks i make no sense .
 keep on doing it .
 if anyone asks ,  just respond with  &apos;listen ,  i don &apos;t tell you you how to protect you and your family ,  don &apos;t start telling me how to protect mine &apos; .
 most of the covidiots i run in to are against it because they don &apos;t like being told how to live their lives ,  so use that mind set against them
 i walked out of work .
 as the hr manager i had no choice .
 i was just so frustrated that my boss wasn &apos;t taking it seriously .
 this happened in april when we (south africa) went into lockdown .
 he wouldn &apos;t provide masks ,  gloves ,  barriers etc for the factory .
 then insisted all the office workers stay .
 so i walked out .
 i carried on working from home & completed all my tasks .
 got disciplinary action but he couldn &apos;t fire me .
 months later things have finally changed .
 but i &apos;ve found another job .
 if that &apos;s how he treats staff &apos;s lives ,  he &apos;ll do it again .
 tomorrow is my last day .
 so ,  protect yourself & your family first .
 and ignore the idiots .
 this pandemic is real .
 in public i wear big over ear headphones .
 at work when people say insane conspiracy shit i laugh at them .
 it’s the only response i’ve found that shuts them up .
 i tried to explain and discuss the facts but once i realized that was never going to work i just started laughing at them .
 and i mean at them .
 i just happily agree .
   &apos;yup ,  i &apos;m paranoid .
  yup ,  we are all crazy .
  no ,  we still won &apos;t get together with you ,  because i &apos;m so paranoid and crazy .
  and yes ,  i still wear a mask every time i go outside ,  because i &apos;m so paranoid and crazy .
 the top priority in a pandemic is to survive it without getting sick .
  period ,  full stop ,  end of story .
  let everyone else think what they think .
  just do what you need to do to keep yourself safe .
 i &apos;ve had a fair share of arguments and have been branded the  &apos;crazy ,  overprotective new mom &apos; by my husband &apos;s family because i &apos;ve taken this pandemic seriously as absolutely possible since the beginning .
 yes ,  i &apos;m especially adamant when it comes to my 5 month old ,  but i &apos;d be just as serious if i didn &apos;t have a baby around for this .
 i cope by keeping my foot firmly down and mostly ignoring the snide comments that come my way .
 i don &apos;t need to justify my actions and decisions ,  so if you can &apos;t comply with them ,  then don &apos;t bother me with your bitching .
 there &apos;s a few loved ones that are much more  &apos;relaxed ,  &apos; but they &apos;ve been respectful of my decisions .
 i wear a hat in winter to keep my head warm .
 i treat a mask the same way .
 i don’t care what other people think ,  and i have become so used to having a mask with me i feel uncomfortable without one .
 just keep doing your thing and keep yourself safe .
 the others will have to find out the hard way if they get it .
 this should have never been politicized in the first place .
 heard this from someone else- just say “apparently i care about you more than you care about me .
 it &apos;s like driving a car ,  and the other drivers aren &apos;t being safe .
 you keep your distance ,  try to stay positive ,  and try to understand that everyone has different levels of risk tolerance ,  understanding of the rules ,  etc .
 and that the best you can do is keep yourself safe and not contribute to the problem .
 getting upset ,  or wanting to personally intervene to police other people &apos;s behavior is perfectly understandable ,  but it probably won &apos;t help ,  it might even make things worse .
 i get upset ,  but you only get to pick so many battles in life .
 i work in a pharmacy and i’m pretty fascinated by covid ,  so i’m constantly reading about the virus ,  treatment protocols ,  vaccines ,  etc .
 when i smell people trying to be shitty about the whole thing ,  i usually rattle off some of the more interesting things i’ve read lately and they usually reply with some stupid conspiracy theory and i just tell them i can’t go down that rabbit hole with them .
 also ,  while i have the platform ,  hey ,  you fucking idiots ,  the government is pouring billions into facial recognition ,  a mask is your best defense against covid and restoring your privacy !
 i remember seeing a tweet that read something like this (paraphrasing) .
 “even if the pandemic turns out not to be a big deal ,  and we really are all ‘sheep’ i’ll be content knowing i was a sheep by caring for other people and wearing a mask” .
 this stuck with me and makes me glad to follow guidelines
 i cope by not having to go to the er because of covid symptoms
 well ,  one factor is that i am “crazy” - like ,  dsm iii levels of neurological distinctiveness ,  chronic & severe .
 to me ,  this is just an update: the paranoid anxiety i have always experienced .
 most people aren’t used to their reality upending suddenly ,  so it upsets them more .
 to me ,  this is the world swimming in the waters i grew up in - constant fear ,  uncertainty; no reliable guidance or expertise that is consistent or trustworthy; people ignoring what they don’t want to believe so they can have the reality they want .
 from my perspective ,  the asylum just got .
 i used to try and talk to them ,  but they didn &apos;t logic themselves into their mindset and i can &apos;t logic them out of it ,  so whatever .
 these days ,  i just ignore them as much as possible ,  and when i can &apos;t ,  when it &apos;s actual family or friends ,  i say ,  look ,  i &apos;m immuno-compromised ,  my father &apos;s in his 70s ,  both my sisters have lung issues .
 this thing gets to us and our whole family is going down .
 sure ,  there &apos;s a 99% survivability rate ,  but 1% starts looking like a big fucking number when that shit hits your family fan .
 does the mask work ?
 i &apos;m not going to argue with you .
 if there &apos;s even a chance i could save a life by wearing the mask and the only thing i risk is looking like a fool ,  i &apos;ll wear the fucking mask .
 i &apos;ll wear a rainbow clown afro and a honking nose on each nipple if that helps .
 i &apos;ll survive looking like a fool; people are dying from covid .
 oh ,  i &apos;m living in fear ?
 i wear oven mitts when i bake ,  i don &apos;t fear the fucking oven .
 i &apos;m taking a reasonable precaution against foreseeable harm .
 if they &apos;re still in it with me after that ,  it &apos;s usually because blah blah blah god &apos;s will ,  and there &apos;s nothing i can do about that except say they &apos;re free to put their faith in prayer and i &apos;m free to put mine in a mask .
 i get the  &apos;you &apos;re a sheep ,  &apos; counter-argument a lot .
 my go-to is  &apos;you &apos;re an ostrich ,  &apos; but i &apos;m told  &apos;you &apos;re a cunt ,  &apos; shuts them down just as well if not better .
 i’m feeling some sort of mix of “everyone around me is stupid” ,  “i wish i could do fun family things like everyone else is” ,  and “i must be losing my god damn mind” .
 literally everyone else in my life is playing fast and loose with the safety guidelines except my grandparents ,  because one of them is a retired respiratory therapist .
 friends and family i previously thought of as smart ,  caring individuals are going on vacations ,  dates ,  or whining about mask policies .
 meanwhile looking down on me because i’ve found a way to not return to my shitty tourism job and still pay my bills .
 my kids pediatrician encouraged getting their hair cut at a salon & taking pictures with santa this year .
 i’m about to spend $40 to drive through a park with christmas lights in an attempt to give my toddler some sense of a normal holiday after feeling like i robbed him of a summer of fun — which i did .
 because every time i even took him to the grocery store ,  strangers tried to touch him .
 after sticking to strict isolation ,  mask wearing & cleaning habits since march ,  i’m simultaneously worn out and reinvigorated .
 i honestly don’t think i’m superior in any way to the people around me ,  but this shit is starting to feel like some basic darwinism .
 i &apos;m a middle school teacher .
 so far at least half the staff have contracted the virus at some point this year .
 every week another child has to quarantine or tests positive .
 i had to call my grandmother ,  who is in the beginning stages of alzheimer &apos;s ,  and explain that i &apos;ve not felt well and have been exposed multiple times at work .
 all she wanted was for me to bring my puppy with me to dinner for thanksgiving .
 turns out i &apos;m the only family member not going .
 and i &apos;m the family scapegoat ,  so i &apos;m sure tomorrow i &apos;ll have to deal with the phone calls and texts of how it &apos;s not a big deal and why wouldn &apos;t i just come and reminders that i missed easter too .
 and i &apos;m out of antidepressants .
 i’m in a weird position .
 i have to speak with people daily from ny and nj for work but in live in the south .
 since march ,  the people i speak with for work are far more cautious/nervous about this than the people i know and they always bring it up .
 i talk more freely about my concerns with work people because they seem to also be concerned .
 i’ve never been that personal in a work setting but it at least allows some catharsis .
 i work in hospice ,  so i tell them to keep it up ,  because i &apos;m the one that pulls the plug .
 reactions are awkward 100% of the time .
 i actually almost feel justified .
 my husband &apos;s family all caught covid because they were at a party together and here we are with no covid because neither of us are about that life right now (we are hoping everyone recovers fine ,  but idk if that is gonna happen .
 his parents are both high risk) .
 we miss our family ,  but safety first .
 i was in wyoming recently (necessary travel) and was the only one wearing a mask inside .
 while in line someone asked “what are ya scared or something” ,  so i pulled down my mask a tiny bit and said “no ,  i have covid , ” dude had an ‘oh shit face’ for sure .
 it’s harder when it’s people i love who are not being careful ,  such as still hosting holiday gatherings ,  seeing each other indoors without masks ,  etc .
 and then writing me off as the shrill one when i bring any of it up .
  i feel helpless a lot .
  feeling so isolated is getting to me and i honestly can’t remember the last time i’ve dealt with so much suicidal ideation but then i think about how i would feel if i chose to shirk my responsibility to the community and my choice created an unnecessary risk for others and i know that the shame ,  guilt and isolation from that would be significantly worse so i keep pushing on ,  venting to my loved ones and trying to also support them .
 i am also in the really cool position of being able to watch my children absorb and adjust so flawlessly and so selflessly to this current state of the world .
  we don’t give these kids enough credit ,  we really don’t .
  they are carrying this society right now and just displaying such an incredible level of grace and flexibility; not just mine but most children .
  they are struggling ,  too but just in a way that is so innocent ,  so devoid of politics or bias compared to the adults and they are discovering strengths and abilities within themselves that i think most adults should really admire .
  i’m proud of these damn kids and they keep me going .
 i wanted to edit to add: i appreciate people’s concern and care for me so much .
  i am so lucky to have a good support system and i am okay .
  i have thoughts but never plans because i do absolutely know my value .
  i just wish people gave more credit to the mental health side of this experience; i value so greatly our responsibility to stop the spread ,  to stay home ,  to mask but i also want people to know it’s okay to struggle through it ,  we aren’t alone in it even when it feels lonely .
 my wife &apos;s a nurse .
 and she &apos;s working more now than ever because .
 what a fucking shock !
 there &apos;s a shortage of nurses because they keep getting sick from asswipes like this .
 and i have no fucking problem telling them this .
 if you don &apos;t practice social distancing or wear a mask and you get sick i think you should be banned from going to a hospital .
 because your fucking stupidity ,  arrogance and overall selfishness is literally putting the only people who can do anything about this fucking bullshit at risk .
 die in your fucking house alone asshole .
 keep my wife out of your crap .
 if my wife read this she would be super pissed at me .
 because unlike all of you assholes who refuse to wear a mask and practice social distancing she &apos;s a good person who has ,  and will continue ,  to put herself at risk to help people .
 after having too many customers not take the mask rules seriously ,  we hired a bouncer .
 i work in a bookstore .
 not well at all to be honest .
 my daughter has a congenital heart defect so i &apos;m in a position where my wife and i are forced to take it seriously ,  more so than others .
 murderous rage is all i feel all fucking day .
 my urge to rip people &apos;s heads off with my barehands and knowing i &apos;m actually quite capable of doing so and restraining myself is a level of self control i &apos;m achieving only through anxiety medications and limiting my time among other people .
 i &apos;ve altogether stopped going on social media except here where it &apos;s completely curated .
 i no longer talk to a lot of people .
 at work i don &apos;t interact with coworkers .
 this shit has ruined my fucking life .
 i can &apos;t wait for a vaccine and to just get on with life .
 a healthy dose of depression
 i tune out anyone making fun of me for trying to be safe .
 i’m immunocompromised and have been a hermit since march ,  literally never leaving my house .
 i took two trips to walmart and got covid .
 that was a month ago and i’m on 7 medications ,  in haler ,  nebulizer ,  i live on the 2nd floor and can’t even make it down the stairs .
 call me paranoid but the safest place is not around other people who do not care about you .
 if these people don’t care about their own loved ones possibly getting infected from them they’re not going to care about you .
 where i &apos;m at it is acceptable to follow the guidelines and it is encourage .
 i tend not to go out at all ,   and i have enough people around me who i care about who follow the rules too .
  &apos;those who mind don &apos;t matter ,  those who matter don &apos;t mind .
 i kept doing my thing ,  and insisting on social distancing and masks if they wanted to be around me ,  until i could stop going in to the office .
 now i refuse to go in ,  and work from home 100% until this wave is under control .
 i might go in to do some on-site only work ,  if it can be guaranteed that i can work in the area alone ,  or that anyone coming in wears a mask fucking properly and keeps their goddamn distance .
 i am done fucking around with this shit .
 dick nosers and chin diapers and people walking right up to breathe in your fucking face ,  big ass training classes with people from all over being held in the conference rooms ,  people coming in for meetings and hanging out ,  just as though a quarter of a million people aren &apos;t fucking dead .
 families shattered ,  lives of their loved ones in shambles ,  dead .
 i can &apos;t fathom how people don &apos;t get that and i &apos;m done being polite ,  i &apos;m over being rhetorical .
 wear your fucking mask ,  wash your goddamn hands ,  stay the fuck back ,  from me ,  from everyone ,  as much as possible ,  and stay the fuck home as much as you can .
 the absolute worst part of all this is we &apos;re at the beginning of this wave .
 quarter of a million of us are already dead .
 almost 13 million are infected ,  that we know about ,  and it &apos;s climbing at an alarming rate .
 43% over yesterday ,  in fact .
 but by all means ,  go crowd around a table and eat with family and friends .
 then go wear a mask on your chin while you cram into big box stores to buy shit you don &apos;t fucking need .
 then go infect people where you work on monday .
 so they can infect people where they socialize .
 who can infect people where they work .
 god ,  we &apos;re fucking idiots .
 i wonder if we even deserve to survive this thing .
 i don &apos;t know about other people ,  but i just get extremely stressed out and stops going outside ,  and manifest many signs of mental health issues .
 in short ,   &apos;i don &apos;t &apos; .
 other people at work seem to make fun of me and make a big gesture about putting their mask on correctly when i come around .
 this is because i was a squeaky wheel to their boss about them wearing them incorrectly before .
 now when they act like that around me i just don’t react because obviously i got what i wanted .
 i’m a covid nurse .
 it infuriates me .
 words can’t describe how fucking angry i am .
 teenage me thought everyone around me were idiots .
 later ,  i realized i was just being an edgy depressed teenager .
 turns out teenage me was right .
 by reminding myself that my actions are keeping others safe ,  and those who choose to go about life just as before are simply selfish and self centered .
 my circle of friends has shrunk by quite a bit over the last few months .
 how you choose to act during the pandemic speaks volumes about your character ,  or lack thereof .
 i find comfort in knowing i’m not a narcissistic dick face .
 man ,  i had to tell my mom i couldn &apos;t come to see her tomorrow because someone got covid at work .
 she &apos;s almsot 70 ,  i &apos;m not going to get her sick .
 i haven &apos;t seen her since jan and she cries everytime we talk on the phone .
 it &apos;s fucking heartbreaking ,  but i &apos;m not going to kill my mother .
 that &apos;d be it for me .
 i smoked a bowl and played magic online with friends .
 shit sucks ,  but she &apos;ll eventually understand ,  maybe; who knows .
 i cope by prioritizing myself for once in my gd life .
 before this pandemic i was always being everywhere for everyone else and sacrificing me time or just alone time with the husband because we always had somewhere to be and i hated it ,  constantly visiting with friends or family was beginning to feel like a chore .
 now i have a valid reason to say no to anyone else and put myself and my principles first and if they don &apos;t like it ,  fuck it ,  i have absolutely no cares whatsoever .
 don &apos;t wanna stay friends with me ,  wanna think i &apos;m crazy ?
 that &apos;s okay ,  i didn &apos;t need you then ,  i don &apos;t now .
 to be honest ,  i &apos;m finding it really difficult .
 my girlfriend &apos;s mum has had cancer for the last year and was not looking good towards the start of the second lockdown in the uk .
 i persuaded her to move back in with her family just in case things went south .
 since we also work together ,  i decided to stay at home and manage things here ,  including both of our workloads .
 things did go south ,  and gf &apos;s mum was moved back home so that everyone could be there for her .
 i took a few days off work as i thought it was essential ,  and was there when she passed on a saturday morning .
 that was an exceptional circumstance .
 after what happened i returned home and am continuing to manage our work while the family grieves .
 this sunday it &apos;s my 30th birthday .
 i &apos;ll unfortunately be spending it alone ,  because it &apos;s not an exceptional circumstance .
 my girlfriend cannot come back home because it &apos;s not an exceptional circumstance .
 sorry about brain dump .
 it is really tough .
 there are days where you sit and curse the world because you see people living  &apos;normal &apos; lives ,  and you can &apos;t .
 you wish people took it seriously because you hate hearing how people you know and love and respect are getting it .
 you lose sleep over wondering if fitting in would be worth a possible exposure .
 you make hard decisions where there is no right answer ,  and you &apos;re doing the best you can .
 you might lose friends ,  and you mourn those relationships lost as much as you mourn not getting hugs when you see people ,  or going to social events .
 but you wake up every day knowing you &apos;re keeping the ones closest to you safe .
 you see the people in your bubble ,  be it family or friends and think that you &apos;re the luckiest person in the world to be stuck with these people .
 you celebrate the small things ,  and laugh as much as you can .
 you do the best you can with each new day ,  knowing you &apos;re doing what you know is right .
 so much peer pressure ,  makes me just avoid talking to people all together .
 i work at a large science lab and i was blown away when i found out 75% of my team were going to thanksgiving events with their families .
 everyone has this won’t happen to me mentality .
 indifference to people &apos;s opinions .
 if me wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer bothers someone that much they need to rethink their priorities and ill mention it to them .
 my sister was diagnosed with cancer at the beginning of this year right before covid ,  it &apos;s interesting that most people will argue with me about masks until i point out my sister is going through chemo right now ,  then they &apos;re like  &apos;well that makes sense for you to wear a mask &apos; .
 they &apos;re so close to getting it sometimes ,  but just miss the point .
 i &apos;m not a unique case ,  most people know someone who &apos;s health is compromised ,  that &apos;s why everyone should wear masks .
 it &apos;s just so simple .
 being a brown person in southern utah ,  where it’s super mormon is not ideal .
 i already get some weird looks for my skin color and adding a mask on top of that seems to make people more suspicious of me .
 i think masks are mandated in the entire state due to the overflow in hospitals but you’ll still see people in coffee shops ordering drinks without a mask on .
 so far ,  by nearly losing my business ,  hating most people i know and feeling about as helpless as possible .
 i &apos;m a tattoo artist .
 by trade i can &apos;t not sit in strangers bubbles .
 i now work a remote cs job 40 hours a week and tattoo just enough to cover my booth rent .
 i still feel unsafe .
 the bar next door has their porch enclosed with winter plastic and has a full band playing live most weekends .
 it &apos;s really fucking hard not to give up .
 i &apos;m so disappointed in most people i know .
 with the absolute lack of funding ,  it &apos;s hard find any hope .
 if nothing happens until biden takes over ,  that means financial aide won &apos;t be distributed before march at the earliest ,  and i will lose my business or get sick by then .
  two counties around raleigh are in exponential growth rn .
 don &apos;t give a fuck about them
 before i got laid off ,  i developed a reputation at my job for being ready to dump all the information on people who argued unnecessarily with me .
 my trump-loving coworkers quickly figured out that if they didn &apos;t want to be forcibly educated in basic microbiology and epidemiology they needed to mask up and shut up around me .
 i have an “eyes on your own plate” approach .
 since i don’t leave the house ,  i don’t see how crowded the restaurants are or how pact the stores are .
 i block/unfollow/unfriend anyone on my social medias who post about going out so i dont have to see it .
 i know i’m not crazy for acting like this ,  so i don’t allow anyone who’s not taking this seriously to even show up on my radar .
 i have around 5 friends or mostly people i know that were denying the virus even existed and had to be hospitalised .
 they are now following every guidance .
 fuck those people .
 my respect has been lost for them forever .
 i catch myself making excuses like  &apos;i &apos;ve got a heart condition &apos; which is true ,  but i &apos;d be taking the same precautions regardless .
 and the most rediculous thing is that the people i am saying this to most often are medical professionals !
  why are the nurses at the rheumatology clinic and even my sleep doctor acting surprised that i do not wanting to come into the office just to renew a prescription !
 try this on for size .
 my company is forcing me to be client facing .
 i can &apos;t say more but the way i &apos;m being treated because i don &apos;t want to makes me feel super guilty and that &apos;s wrong .
 but you know ,  do it or fuck off .
 this pandemic has shown what fickle ,  lack of backbone managers i currently have .
 all hiding at home like a bunch of pussies .
 this scenario legitimately just happened .
 i popped by my dads for a pre thanksgiving get together .
 unbeknownst to me ,  he invited 3 of my cousins and randomly told an anecdote about how his boss got covid and he found out to day “haha” what a laugh !
 my cousins and i were pissed and i left last to explain to my dad why and he basically just bashed liberals .
 so how did i cope ?
 there was no need because i know me and my cousins were in the right and my dad just felt foolish for letting that very important information slip .
 look at them like they’re stupid ,  and laugh as i walk away .
 that or just annoyingly glare at them until they get uncomfortable and leave
 one advantage of getting older is that everyone assumes i know what i am doing .
  no one questions me about anything .
 i am in this boat too .
 everyone in the town i’m in thinks it’s some weird hoax & the cases and deaths aren’t a big deal apparently .
 and im freaked out by covid .
 i don’t want to die ,  or accidentally spread it to someone who spreads it to other people .
 like ,  why can’t we all just be cautious and safe .
 if i’m wrong ,  i stayed locked up in my house for some months (&i truly absolutely don’t mind .
 i enjoy it honestly) but if you’re all wrong you could potentially kill people .
 people you love .
 or die yourself .
 that’s so fucked up .
 don’t take the risk
 it &apos;s mostly the  &apos;sheep &apos; comments that infuriate me to no end but i find it hard to intelligently counter that point .
 it &apos;s just so non-sensical that i struggle to find a good rebuttal and just get frustrated .
 today i am at home .
 i &apos;ve got a cold but i woke up today and my sinuses are blocked .
 i cant smell shit .
 my temperature is a bit high .
 that &apos;s what happens .
 i am not going to work .
 i am arranging a test .
 i do this because i am in daily and weekly contact with hundreds of pupils aged 11-18 .
 i was also off for two weeks because a student i work closely with had it .
 i &apos;ve only just got back of course .
 work is shitty with me about it .
 they &apos;re frustrated i am following procedures .
 they have sent out a circular email stating ,   &apos;please ensure that absense due to covid symptoms are due to accurate identification of covid related symptoms &apos; .
 some staff are literally gloating about how they came in with x and y symptom because they knew they didn &apos;t have it .
 it was just a cold ,  or a bug .
 i know i have a cold .
 i am also not arrogant or stupid enough to believe i could tell if i had covid too .
 so today ,  i cant smell shit .
 so i &apos;ll go get a test .
 because that &apos;s the responsible thing to do .
 i feel bad about my pupils and i am so sad about the impact this is having on their education .
 but as long as they keep the schools open ,  i will follow government procedures to the letter .
 it &apos;s the only ethical thing to do to protect others .
 it continues to amaze me how apathetic some other teachers and senior staff are about being off because of it .
 idk ,  everyone around me is pretty much following the rules (bay area)
 i usually go with  &apos;i &apos;m a paramedic and i work with covid patients but i can cough take it off if you &apos;d feel more comfortable &apos; .
 they usually stfu and back away .
 the thing i don &apos;t understand is that a mask is mostly to keep others safe from you .
 it &apos;s hardly going to do anything to stop other people &apos;s funk from getting to you at all .
 it &apos;s a simple act you can do to help everyone else .
 it &apos;s sort of silly ,  in my opinion ,  for people to make fun of others that keep their own best interest in mind .
 i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever understand that mindset .
 other people wearing a mask directly benefits you .
 why squander that ?
 yesterday a woman was wearing her shitty bead face mask and stood right behind me at whole foods .
 i told her to please back off ,  told her my work life and she still wouldn’t budge .
 i then told her to fuck off in a very low but angry tone .
 it’s my first “fuck off” i’ve said to anyone in at least 10yrs .
 i hope you’re being treated well at work .
 wow awards  thank you kind strangers .
 i work in healthcare too ,  nuc med tech .
 nothing like an icu nurse .
 you guys are badasses in a good way .
 but i’ve still been wearing a n95 mask with face shield for 9 hours a day since february ,  while trying to make sure staff and patients mask up and stay 6ft apart too ,  and vigilantly wipe everything down with purple wipes .
 my parents live in mi and traveled to tn ,  to visit family against my recommendation .
 so i’m just home by myself ,  and will facetime them .
 it’s tough ,  for sure .
 but ,  we all choose to live in a society ,  and this is what a society is supposed to do; when a catastrophic event occurs ,  we are supposed to do what is best to save the society .
 it’s a sacrifice for the greater good .
 but ,  we are an amazon nation who wants it ,  and wants it now .
 we live our whole lives as the individual; we worry about our school grades ,  our college acceptance ,  our job opportunity ,  our immediate family .
 and ,  never concerning ourselves with what is best for us as a whole .
 this a world filled with winners and losers in america .
 so if you’re like me ,  doing your part for what we perceive to be the greater good for all of us ,  then a sincere thank you to you .
 happy isolated turkey day ,  and merry isolates xmas to you .
 the end is in sight .
 the vaccine is almost here .
 my response is always ‘you obviously don’t know anyone who has died from covid .
 i’m so sorry for your loss .
 do you get snide comments in usa if you wear a mask ?
 ask him if it &apos;s harder to breathe now or was it harder through the mask .
 i’m the first to admit i was very dismissive of it at first .
 my boss stocked up on ppe ,  we had policies and procedures in place for when it reached us ,  and i just dismissed it as an overreaction .
 then it reached the uk .
 then it reached my town .
 then i saw the numbers in the local mortuaries going up and suddenly all the ppe we wore to do removals didn’t seem so silly anymore .
 has he made any comments ?
 like apologies about saying it’s a hoax
 my mom has been apologizing profusely because she &apos;s too scared to spend my son &apos;s first thanksgiving with him .
 i don &apos;t know how many more ways i can tell her she shouldn &apos;t be sorry for wanting to keep him safe .
 at least by being safe you’ll have the ability to hold your breath
 you are doing the correct thing .
  i just had a zoom call with my grandma who told me she is going to die today .
  she has had covid for  over 2 weeks and has had leukemia for years .
  my mother also has covid and is isolated with her trying to keep her alive but has no energy to get her out of bed .
  m you don’t want to be on a zoom call and hear you mom and grandma crying together thinking they are going to die .
 when everyone else has no mask ,  and questions your sanity for why you &apos;re wearing one .
 that &apos;s when you show up with a full papr .
 (also ,  because if they &apos;re not being safe ,  they &apos;re a much bigger threat to you ,  than you are to them .
  so the selfish filtration model is justified .
 recently i was in travelling in a  bus and a man sitting beside me wasn &apos;t wearing a mask .
 and when i told him to wear it ,  he just points toward other people in the bus who aren &apos;t wearing a mask .
 i just told him  &apos;i ain &apos;t gonna tell everyone ,  you are sitting beside me so i am telling you to wear it .
  &apos; ,  he then puts on mask .
 guess what ,  a man in my next to left seat also puts it on !
 many people are doubting this happened and i don &apos;t know  ,  go ahead .
 i don &apos;t want to prove this to everyone .
 idk why telling people to wear a mask is being doubtable ?
 i’m still working on embracing the fact that everyone in my family just thinks i’m a huge bitch who invented covid solely to inconvenience them .
 i like this one .
 i use ultimatum approach .
 i say to them there are two choice ,  either do it ,  or don &apos;t .
 then explain the two choices .
  &apos;what if you are right ?
 i just look silly and that &apos;s it .
 but what if i &apos;m right ?
 you could catch it and spread it to someone who could die from it .
 so which one is better ?
 the potential of looking silly ,  or the potential of being responsible for someone &apos;s death .
  &apos; most end the conversation and walk away because they know they aren &apos;t fans of being called potential murders .
 nice ,  i &apos;ll put this one in my back pocket .
 using their mentality against them is the trick .
 you gotta outstupid them .
 “anti mask mindset is rhetoric created by the liberal media disguised as conservative freedom protection designed to allow covid to spread thru the conservative population more freely when 5g towers are installed .
 ” make it a bigger conspiracy to think about 
 i’m in oklahoma ,  us and  i hope bosses all over the world had some of us who won’t tolerate their bullshit !
 my new go-to interview question for companies is going to be:  tell me about your covid response and talk me through your decision making .
 i haven &apos;t used it yet ,  but i think that &apos;ll tell me damn near everything i need to know about a company .
 the set of balls/ovaries on you is outstanding .
 i work security and one of the businesses i cover is a movie theater that is doing everything they can to be safe .
 mandatory mask or face covering ,  spaced out seating ,  immediately to your seat once you have concession items ,  sanitize after every showing ,  etc .
 with some recent increases to precautions (masks going from recommended to legally required indoors) they &apos;ve had a bunch of conspiracy theorist types coming through their doors refusing the provided mask ,  pulling out a  &apos;mask exemption &apos; card .
 they all tell you to go to the website for proof that its real but it just links to a far right ,  nazi sympathizing ,  anti immigration ,  racist shit hole website (that is almost always down because these dumb asses go to it do much and they are too cheap to upgrade their servers) .
 every single one says its violating their civil rights to deny them service ,  demand to have the cops called .
 i oblige them and call the cops for their trespassing and then spend the 20 to 30mins waiting for them reading off the wikipedia page for the website they got this card from .
 i explain that they are directly supporting nazis by giving them ad revenue ,  i call them nazis loud enough that other guests can hear is and talk over them so they can &apos;t spout more of their shit .
 most walk off before the cops arrive ,  i tell them not to return even after this is all over because we don &apos;t welcome nazis .
 one couple actually stayed until the cops got there and were promptly told their civil rights were not being violated and they were idiots and trespassing .
 i &apos;ve had enough of these morons .
 if they don &apos;t want to wear a mask outside ,  whatever ,  their right for now .
 but come into a business and they aren &apos;t going to get their way ,  they are just going to be banned because they are a much bigger threat than any shoplifter .
 i used to work with a flat earther .
 one day he was explaining his ideas to a grandmother aged woman i work with ,  she was quiet ,  heard him out and then just goes .
 “you seem hungry .
 it was so gentle and sweet but also told him she though he was an idiot .
 i think about that moment a lot when i encounter covid deniers .
 you gotta out crazy them by coming up with a bigger conspiracy .
 like if someone says the earth is flat ,  snort condescendingly ,  “you believe  the earth exists ?
 laughter and humour is the best defense .
 that &apos;s how people were able to get the crazy westboro baptist church to shut up and give up when rallying .
 i can &apos;t help but get angry and tongue tied at stupid reasoning so humour is a good tactic i should use .
 this i like this .
 one my my coworkers keeps trying to talk politics and i mostly ignore her because she &apos;s on the wrong side of history .
 however right after the election she tried to bring up minimum wage and how kids out of high school will make almost as much money as us .
 i snorted and said as much money as you do maybe and went back to work .
 i read an article somewhere that said this strategy can be highly effective in ending this sort of debate ,  as the other person will run out of steam within about 30 seconds ,  if you actually just laugh at what they are saying and stop engaging .
  very few people have the stones to continue making a point when you &apos;re properly belly laughing at them ,  and turn your back on the the convo .
 i &apos;m sure it was part of an actual study or something ,  like someone scienced it up proper an shit .
 similarly i’ve just been overtly rude to people in public without masks on .
 i just pretend they don’t exist .
 so what if i cut you off in the supermarket or step in front of you where i may have previously let you go first .
 you aren’t getting an excuse me ,  or a polite interaction .
 im not going to move out of your way in the aisle i’m shopping in .
 i’m actively rescinding any courtesy i would have previously been extended .
 it may seem petty ,  but being polite and courteous isn’t nothing .
 you don’t deserve my good will/wishes if you can’t do the simplest thing to combat this virus .
 keep in mind i don’t go out often and when i do my 70% red state does it’s level best to reinforce their dumbass position on all of our current cultural failings .
 be it maga hats ,  stars and bars ,  no masks ,  blue lives matter stickers ,  you name it .
 it’s all on display constantly and it’s really taken its toll on a generally kind and well meaning person .
 my dad was tested positive for covid and got admitted in the hospital ,  but my mum still doesn &apos;t believes in covid (mind you ,  she &apos;s well educated and privileged enough to .
 ) anyway ,  after 2 weeks ,  dad &apos;s doing much better now .
 i always keep a picture of my mum in my wallet .
 whenever i face difficulties in life ,  i take out my wallet and stare at her picture .
 and lately ,  it comforts me knowing that .
 if my dad can survive covid ,  and i can survive being a daughter of a staunch conspiracy theorist ,  i can survive almost anything .
 i choose to be paranoid about salmonella ,  so i overcook my chicken slightly .
 and wash my cutting board and hands after handling meat or eggs .
 i choose to be paranoid about becoming paralysed ,  so i wear a seatbelt .
 i choose to be paranoid about brushing my teeth with fecal matter ,  so i close the toilet seat and put my brush behind a cabinet .
 i choose to be paranoid about frostbite ,  so i wear gloves in the winter .
 i choose to be paranoid about thugs ,  so i stay alert of my surroundings .
 i choose to be paranoid about stds ,  so i wear a condom .
 i choose to be paranoid about people &apos;s motives ,  so i stay skeptical .
 i choose to be paranoid about alligators ,  so i don &apos;t go splashing around in the swamp .
 i choose to be paranoid about lyme disease ,  so i check myself for ticks after i &apos;ve been somewhere even remotely grassy .
 i choose to be paranoid about the rope holding ,  so i double check the knot before i climb .
 i choose to be paranoid about getting a heart attack or diabetes ,  so i eat healthy and exercise .
 you could say that i &apos;m afraid ,  and going through all these hoops prevents me of living my life .
 but i say ,  i go through these hoops so i can live my life to the fullest ,  unafraid ,  for as long as possible - simply by protecting myself from ignorance and stupidity .
 usually i try to spit facts and stats but it is getting absolutely exhausting .
 i &apos;m going to just start agreeing with them ,  yep i &apos;m paranoid and crazy and brain washed for being scared of covid .
 yep ,  i &apos;m a satanic liberal who hates jesus ,  murders babies ,  turns people gay ,  and i support radical socialism !
 i love this answer !
 just go along with it ,  even though you’re doing what’s best for yourself and your household .
 i &apos;m glad i &apos;m not the only one .
 i &apos;m 7 months pregnant ,  and have already told my partner to prepare his parents that when january comes around ,  they will not be seeing their grandchild if they refuse to quarantine .
 i &apos;ve put myself in uncomfortable positions since march because of them ,  and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re going to be even more pissed when i don &apos;t show up to thanksgiving today .
 i know they all just think i &apos;m a bitch ,  and am overreacting .
 you sound like a great mom ,  not a crazy one .
 you &apos;re doing the right thing for your child ,  and sticking to your guns .
 i know it &apos;s not the same ,  but you have internet family who support and respect your decisions .
 my baby turned one this week .
 we pretty much quarantined after her birth ,  as our area had a terrible flu season .
 just a we were about to start going out ,  covid hit .
 my in-laws have told us we  &apos;can &apos;t live in fear .
  &apos;  i &apos;d rather live in fear than not live ,  carol .
 as a new mom with a 4 month old i feel your comment so much .
 we are doing the right thing and you are not alone .
 in my case my in-laws are the reasonable ones ,  my family are the trumpers .
 i have to worry about them constantly and they can &apos;t understand social distancing to save their life ,  or ours for that matter ,  so we won &apos;t see them .
 you &apos;re on to something here
 the hero we need
 is that a garbage bag of chimichangas ?
 honestly ,  i’m excited for the masks in winter .
 now my face won’t freeze ,  and it keeps me ,  and everyone else safe .
 yeah ,  people have really stopped complaining about masks now that it &apos;s getting colder .
 i love how comfy and warm they are ,  combined with the fact that it &apos;s now socially acceptable .
 even while watching movies when people touch each other  ,  go in crowded places  ,  i get so uncomfortable like dudeee wtf r u thinking .
 am i the only one that watches videos from years ago and wonders why people don &apos;t have on masks .
 then realize covid wasn &apos;t around my whole life 
 it &apos;s really crazy .
 i went into a gas station yesterday and the owner kept making jokes about my mask and saying  &apos;oh you aren &apos;t going to rob me are you ?
  &apos; then started talking about how masks don &apos;t work and it &apos;s somehow a biden related conspiracy .
 this should have never been politicized in the first place .
 and it still is because of people being so god damn stubborn to admit they were wrong in the first place about a brand new thing .
 wearing masks in vehicles .
 my boyfriend does not (yet) .
 i needed to go to the doc but was in no way able to drive .
 we masked up ,  he drove ,  i tried to breathe out the window and we santized his truck after .
 i have been sick for a week and a half .
 i work at home ,  on a computer and have not been able to effectively work .
 today i feel slightly better ,  enough to type this but it &apos;s a slow burn to a miserable state and i suspect a long way back to normal .
 be safe and fuck the dumbasses .
 i am spending t-day alone for everyone &apos;s sake !
 its hilarious who thought that there was some mastermind who decided:  .
 mastermind1:  &apos;okay guys get this: we release a virus and then we --- get this !
 -- we recommend people to wear a mask !
 but what if they don &apos;t want to wear a mask ?
 m1:  &apos;oh but they will !
 because its a recommendation !
 but then what about the virus ?
 it won &apos;t spread if ppl wear a mask .
 m1:  &apos;it doesn &apos;t matter !
 because we recommended them wear a mask !
 how is that even important they can just take the mask off if they want ?
 because its a recommendation !
 that sounds stupid af .
 in my case ,  the only time i interact with anti-mask or “covid is a hoax” people is when i’m working as a waitress ,  so i have no choice but to be polite with them .
 (i already answered about how i handle those customers in another comment)  .
 your quote is totally right ,  but unfortunately those people already believe that covid is not a danger to them ,  so that statement will go right over their heads .
 if we’re talking about someone who does understand the danger of covid but still doesn’t take precautions because they’re lazy or selfish ,  then this might hit them differently .
 sometime in october ,  it kinda dawned on me that we were at a spot that was way worse than in march ,  and i was locked down in march .
   so i &apos;ve been locked down .
   no halloween ,  no thanksgiving ,  no christmas .
   i deleted all my dating apps cuz that was just depressing me .
  i am dying to socialize again .
   i was/am fairly introverted ,  but i am dying to socialize again .
   i plan on being social as soon as i feels safe doing it post-vaccine .
  however ,  i can &apos;t imagine being on a first date in the next few years and not talking about the pandemic .
   i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be able to connect at all with someone who has pictures on their instagram of a big 2020 halloween party ,  or like ,  travel pictures from this year .
    &apos;i care about you more than you care about me &apos; .
  i fucking feel that .
 so ,  practice defensive living .
 that &apos;s a really good analogy ,  thank you
 try to stay positive .
 not sure about that part but yeah
 just fucking good life advice in general
 also ,  while i have the platform ,  hey ,  you fucking idiots ,  the government is pouring billions into facial recognition ,  a mask is your best defense against covid and restoring your privacy !
 this is the funniest thing about the chip idiots .
 why would the government bother to inject you with a chip that can only be read over a short distance ,  and would be easy to find and remove ,  when they can just point a camera at your face ?
 honestly pushing it as a resistance to facial recognition software would probably get more traction with those kinds of folks .
 they &apos;re all terrified of the deep state already .
  and seriously ,  what &apos;s the sacrifice here ?
  wearing a piece of cloth on my face ?
  i wear cloth all over my body every day and it &apos;s never bothered me .
 seriously ,  all of the anti-mask nonsense reminds me of a toddler who &apos;s refusing to put on pants .
 coping by not being on a ventilator gang
 today is blackout wednesday and i’m feeling super left out .
 i swear everyone i know is out having a good time at the bars and any other year i’d be there with them .
 but i couldn’t do it this year .
 i’ll drink and play some video games ,  listen to music ,  etc .
 i’d rather see my family members live another day than get drunk at the bar .
 this one resonates .
 thank you for putting into words the feeling i &apos;ve been trying to figure out for the past eight months .
 i can’t believe how much i relate to this .
 most other people are just scared ,  in unfamiliar territory ,  and reacting poorly as a result .
 i can’t condone their selfish behaviour but it is easier to understand and soften my reaction when i look at the situation from this pov ,  so thank you for that .
 earlier this year ,  i had a complete mental breakdown and lost a lot as a result of my frustration with friends/ coworkers not following covid safety protocols .
 things are a bit better now ,  i am treating my illness properly and managing my expectations of others more appropriately ,  but i may always feel like i’m outside looking in .
 i am really ,  really good at sticking to the recommendations for social distance ,  masks ,  etc ,  but the hardest part of all of this is managing my mental health while navigating a pandemic .
 how much is too much ?
 who can i trust ?
 why don’t they care ?
 i have found a light at the end of the tunnel and that’s enough .
 i wish you happiness and health ,  and thank you for making me feel a little less alone .
 the asylum just got .
  not just bigger but also kinda  .
 it &apos;s more ,  idk ,  potent now that it &apos;s being globally validated and broadcast at our faces 24/7 .
  like a feedback loop .
  on a good day in the before times i could occasionally indulge in the comforts of denial for a bit ,  like lil manic brain vacations ,  but that stopped working when the world went to hell all at once and now i &apos;m just goddamn tired .
 i feel like i &apos;ve trained my whole life for this year .
 after years of reading how introverts can grow into extroverts if they just follow this listicle or that motivational speaker ,  i &apos;m snickering at their sudden adrift life ,  offering pointers on how to be okay with the person in your head .
  those of us with anxiety have been in training for 2020 all our lives .
 ptsd sufferer here from chronic ,  persistent trauma over years .
 and it sucks that every other sane person now gets me too :( not that i don &apos;t want to be understood but i really don &apos;t want them to be able to understand this feeling and definitely not from experience like this .
 i &apos;ve always been amused by the concept of scarecrow running into someone like you .
  like ,  oh ,  i guess you make people experience acute debilitating anxiety symptoms .
  that &apos;s cute i guess; i &apos;ve been living that life for years and have coping mechanisms .
 the oven mitt analogy is spot on .
 best wishes to you and your family .
 i echo your stress and anger .
 because every time i even took him to the grocery store ,  strangers tried to touch him .
 man that kind of crap needs to stop even without pandemics .
 dude ,  i don &apos;t know you ,  don &apos;t touch my kid .
 make silly faces1 and wave all you want but hands off .
 1 when masks are no longer needed .
 i’m feeling some sort of mix of “everyone around me is stupid” ,  “i wish i could do fun family things like everyone else is” ,  and “i must be losing my god damn mind” .
 thank you for not caving to the pressure .
 i work in a hospital ,  and we &apos;re deeply grateful for the few of you being safe .
 please keep going !
  you’re not alone .
  i’ve got friends i love a ton who are living life like it’s no big deal .
  i know i’ll never look at them the same and wish i could ignore it .
  at any rate ,  many of us are smart about the risk and care for others around us .
  i &apos;m a sub and i work in 10 different schools in five different towns (rural area) and i am all over the place these days .
  last friday i showed up to be a roaming sub at one hs ,  but the history teacher had just started quarantine due to exposure and that morning his sub called from the hospital saying she just had a positive test .
  the day before that i was supposed to be a para at another school ,  but the kid was called in that morning with covid .
  i asked if they wanted me to go home and i found out that they had five other openings that day that they couldn &apos;t get filled .
  i &apos;ve subbed for the same science teacher a half-dozen times now because he is on his third round of quarantine .
  the schools are not doing okay .
 our thanksgiving was only going to be six people this year ,  but now it &apos;s down to five because i &apos;m not going either .
  i have a nasty cold (got tested ,  it &apos;s just a teacher-virus ,  not corona) and am just thanking my lucky stars that i got it during the holiday week and i won &apos;t have to miss class .
  they honestly can &apos;t afford to have any more teachers out sick ,  even with the students doing alternate days .
 turn off your phone .
 seriously ,  you can use a laptop ,  or any other device .
 maybe even juat take the sim out ,  and say some bs reason that your plan expired so couldn &apos;t call yada yada yada
 i angrily told my mom at the beginning of october that i wasn &apos;t coming to any holidays this year because nobody in my family takes it seriously ,  and apparently she must have told everyone because no one so much as invited me .
 it &apos;s kind of great ,  because usually they pull guilt trips for things as trivial as not arriving to a get together sooner ,  so i &apos;m more than happy to sit this one out .
 i grew up in florida and my friend still lives there .
  her dad is 80 and still her brothers are insisting on a big thanksgiving ,  even though their kids are in school .
 new york was closing schools again because of a 3% positive rate .
  here in missouri it &apos;s 27% .
   and people &apos;s biggest annoyance was the county tried to limit kids sports
 same here ,  they lost taste and smell and their thanksgiving dinner is fucked up because of that !
 covid karma i call it .
 my husbands family all has it too .
 they just had to go on a vacation out of state and refused to wear masks ,  well all but the youngest .
 i have told them that i will quite literally mace them if they try to show up before getting a negative test and have no symptoms .
 i ain’t about that widow life at my age .
 my family did that shit too ,  til my mom got covid .
 now i &apos;m suddenly not  &apos;letting it run my life &apos; .
 keep being safe .
 your loved ones are wrong .
 i don’t try to convince anyone about my own actions .
 whatever they’re going to do is what they’re going to do .
 they’re hearing the same things i’m hearing ,  just deciding to act differently .
 i can’t change that .
 i’m so over wasting energy arguing with people who disagree with me on fundamentals of life this year .
 i just flat out won’t engage with anyone’s nonsense anymore .
 it’s what they want ,  to get a rise out of you .
 all of us are discovering that some people we &apos;ve liked for a very long time are morons .
  life has a way of sorting out the people who are worth time and effort ,  and the sorting is happening double-time right now .
  but there are also people out there who are nailing it .
  i intend to fill my life with people who responded to this crisis correctly ,  because those are people i can trust .
 my partner &apos;s family lives abroad (europe so still pretty close) .
 his mom is an avid conspiracy theorist ,  it was okayish before corona but she &apos;s really gotten into it now .
 the full thing: corona is a hoax ,  bill gates wants to implant microchips ,  they &apos;re stealing our freedom ,  doctors are lying .
 i &apos;m a doctor for one of the most vulnerable groups of people .
 i literally can &apos;t take risks ,  even if i &apos;d want to .
 i have refused to go to her birthday since i &apos;d be one of over 10 people to be there .
 i hate that this might ruin any normal relationship i &apos;d have with what &apos;s hopefully someday my mother in law .
 but it &apos;s what covid is doing .
 and i &apos;d rather protect myself and the lives i took an oath for ,  than listen to a lunatic ramble about how doctors are in on it all ,  me included .
 i &apos;m in a similar boat .
 i called my parents and told them i won &apos;t be flying over to see them this christmas .
 i thought they &apos;d be expecting it ,  tbh .
 apparently ,  i &apos;m  &apos;over-exagerating &apos; and the  &apos;chance is so small &apos; ,  like planes aren &apos;t going to be filled with idiots who think the same .
 this year has opened my eyes to the fact that i &apos;m on my own and can &apos;t ever trust their advice at face value ,  as i often used to .
 it makes me sad ,  but is what it is .
 the way you talk about your kids is so wonderful .
 they reflect their environment ,  and clearly you’re giving them a really good one .
 i’m a waitress and i get a lot of customers who complain about the masks or ask me “isn’t it soooo terrible to work as a waitress with a mask on your face all day ?
 ” i wouldn’t usually get involved ,  but since they asked ,  i tell them that my husband has lung issues and other complications from working as a first responder at the wtc on 9/11 ,  and if i brought the virus home to him ,  i could kill him .
 this is why i take all the precautions very seriously .
 usually they don’t push it further .
 i could just say my husband has health issues ,  but usually the anti-mask people are the same people who go hard with the “remember 9/11” ,  so i think by mentioning that ,  they feel more like i’m on “their side” ,  at least in some vague way .
 or maybe it’s because it’s hard to hear “my husband was a first responder on 9/11 and is now dying from it” and reply with dumb anti-mask baby boomer copypasta .
 i don’t say it all the time ,  only to certain people ,  and most of the time they reply with something like “your husband’s a true patriot” .
 would you like to hear our specials for today .
 sorry to the five people who already upvoted me ,  i added several sentences throughout my comment randomly since the time you voted
 please know that all of the non-morons appreciate her beyond belief .
 much love to the nurses and doctors everywhere !
 i hope your wife stays safe and the careless assholes don &apos;t get her sick .
 thank you to your wife for all she does and thank you for supporting her .
 i work at a group home for mentally disabled adults .
 i feel the same way as you .
 my guys ask why they haven &apos;t been able to leave their home for eight months now and i &apos;m furious the reason is because the administration handled it wrong from the start and a-holes keep making it worse .
 i pass a bar every night on my way home and the parking lot is packed .
 if i had any authority ,  i would march into that bar and demand every single one of the people in there (customers) sign a registry and aren &apos;t allowed to use hospital resources .
 you don &apos;t believe this is anything more than a hoax by soros ,  gates blah blah blah ?
 cool ,  sign this registry .
 i think doctors should have that information when deciding who gets what bed .
 man ,  i want this to be over for all these people dealing with silent battles that have suddenly been loudly thrust into the open .
 i am angry for you .
 i keep wondering where all this anger is going to go in the next five years ,  what will it transform into ?
 we will not unsee the hatred .
 we will not forget .
 i &apos;ve struggled to keep myself alive for 20 years now .
 since i was seven .
 i didn &apos;t choose this .
 i didn &apos;t ask for this .
 now ,  after all the hard times ,  after the months spent in the hospital ,  the possible years taken off my life- my biggest vulnerability is some asshat that fails to think critically ?
 you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
 sorry ,  this was a bit of a rant .
 i just read your comment and out of all of these ,  yours hit me the hardest .
 keep doing what you are doing .
 i am happy your daughter has such strong parents .
 we will survive this .
 with a dash of substance abuse
 yeah this whole thing is mentally taxing in so many different ways .
 i hope you find an opportunity to connect with nature ,  even briefly .
 it’s an awful thing .
  you speaking up could have saved their life and yet they are being ducks to you .
 your anger is valid .
  thank you for continuing as best you can during these times .
 username checks out .
 i like you and i like your style
 lmao deadass what i &apos;d do .
 fuck &apos;em they &apos;d rather play games with cheeto than prevent another human being from becoming another death stat or dealing with covid long hauler symptoms
 it &apos;s because they don &apos;t believe the dangers of covid are real ,  or that the dangers are overblown .
 you &apos;ve got one side that &apos;s getting real information about the dangers and are believing it ,  and the other side who &apos;s getting information that it &apos;s a conspiracy or being overblown .
 so ,  when you bring up the fact that it &apos;s to protect other people ,  that &apos;s lost on them because they don &apos;t think there &apos;s a danger .
 people are selfish assholes .
 just to be clear ,  wearing a mask is not 100% to keep others safe from you .
 even a cloth mask somewhat reduces your chance of getting a serious infection .
 how badly your infected is linked to viral load (how much of the virus gets into your body) and a cloth mask will filter some of the virus out ,  even if it can’t stop all of it .
 protecting you: slightly effective   .
 protecting others: very good .
 protecting you: good .
 protecting others: excellent  .
 —n95 with filter & valve— .
 protecting you: good .
 protecting others: bad .
 —-n98 with silicon seal ,  filters ,  and no valve— .
 protecting you: very good .
 protecting others: excellent
 as well as can be during stuff like this .
 my unit has great teamwork and our administration is reasonable so on that front its good .
 i work at a walmart and was at the register with a woman who was working at a hospital treating patients for covid .
 a man without a mask was behind her and wasn’t staying 6 feet away .
 she told him she worked around covid all day and that he should distance himself so he could stay safe .
 he told her he wouldn’t let it run his life and continued to stay where he was .
 after she told him to back away because she felt unsafe with him that close to her the man proceeded to get even closer to her as a “joke .
 ” she told him to stop but you could tell that she was uncomfortable .
 it’s sad people still won’t believe how serious this is .
 today i recieved a bag of candy with a cheesy note .
   &apos;you &apos;re a life saver that &apos;s worth 100 grand .
  &apos;  take a guess what the candy was .
 but many of them don &apos;t .
 that &apos;s the problem .
 my uncle had it and his mil passed from it .
 i also have friends from high school (sisters) whose uncle brought it home .
 they lost their uncle ,  and 2 of their 3 cousins within a month .
 but my mil was all  &apos;idk anyone who &apos;s had it .
 they &apos;re inflating the numbers .
 yeah ,  i have multiple times .
 a few times in wa ,  where i live .
 once in idaho (a woman started screaming at me) .
 i walked into a restaurant in utah to pick up my togo order .
 a table of people coughed at me because i was wearing a mask .
 not a single other person i saw that day wore one .
 sadly in conservative states like indiana yes .
 i hate to see so much people not realizing the importance of wearing a mask ,  but caring about the public health and acting with solidarity seems to interfere some people’s „freedom“ .
 rural ohio ,  maybe 25% mask usage inside grocery stores and such .
 i get at least one snide comment per trip; almost exclusively from the 60+ crowd .
 this week a woman  &apos;muttered &apos; as i was passing her  &apos;sure looks like china in here !
  &apos; someone else wearing a mask turned the corner behind me and she said louder  &apos;help me jesus ,  the sheep are everywhere !
 i decided not to point out that jesus is often called a shepherd .
 (that &apos;s a lie; i didn &apos;t think of it until just now)
 a man attacked me and my partner while we were weeding in our front yard while wearing masks .
 we actually stepped out of his way as he approached .
 he started cussing us out and ended up spitting in my boyfriend’s face .
 i live in a very blue city btw .
 he wouldnt know since he didnt wear one in the first place
  let the hate flow through you .
 i was pretty dismissive at first too .
 then my parents ,  the least alarmist people i have ever met - these are people who would tell me to calm down ,  we don &apos;t need to make an evacuation plan whenever we had a bushfire nearby ,  even if the entire hill behind our house was on fire and we could hear the flames - started talking about having dad work from home and how mum was going to pick up a little extra of everything next time she went shopping .
 needless to say if those two get worried ,  i pay the fuck attention .
 two weeks later everything was upside down and the streets were utterly deserted .
 freaks me out to think about how quickly it escalated .
 i started seeing reports in early january ,  and started making plans to stock up on things that seemed likely to be subject to runs later .
 nothing major ,  just an extra staple or two per run .
 my husband thought i was being unnecessarily worried .
 he stopped thinking that when chicago got a positive case ,  and realized that the genie was out of the bottle .
 i asked him yesterday ,   &apos;so if i told you that something is a really bad thing ,  what will you do ?
 he replied ,   &apos;probably scream and then pass out .
 i think he finally twigged when he saw a picture of a 20 something woman &apos;s lungs after covid-19 - they looked like overdone cheeseburger patties .
 nurses are saying people on their death beds still don’t believe it’s real .
 not op ,  but chances are he even blamed them for  &apos;not finding the real problem &apos; .
 totally did not happen with one of my patients .
 tell her he &apos;s a baby - he won &apos;t remember this thanksgiving anyway .
 but he will remember all the future ones he &apos;s going to get to have with her because everyone stayed safe and healthy this year .
 what if you cough at them .
 “hey frank why you wearing that mask ?
 “i heard there was covid you see ,  what about you steve ?
 where’s that mask of yours” .
 “i aint wearing it frank ,  it’s all a hoax i tell you ,  even if it aint ,  there’s no way it’s getting to me .
 you’re just paranaoid af you see ?
 no one wears a mask here” .
 “really steve ,  i-hold on ,  coughs like you choked on drugs sorry ,  after i lost my sense of taste ,  my cough started to worsen ,  you were saying ?
 and watch everyone stare at you in horror .
 sorry but were doos papr stant voor ?
 man i literally just had this conversation with my own father .
 literally won &apos;t listen to logic .
 problem is i live with him so it &apos;s hard to keep distance .
 idk why telling people to wear a mask is being doubtable ?
 because redditors don &apos;t believe anything can happen if they can &apos;t imagine themselves doing it .
 it &apos;s like they refuse to believe that people can have different personalities and have different reactions to situations
 that &apos;s pretty crazy they actually listened to you .
 people who aren &apos;t wearing a mask only care for themselves .
 alternatively when he says those people aren &apos;t wearing a mask you tell him they aren &apos;t in stabbing distance
 i’m lucky in that i don’t have to rely on the bus majority of the time ,  though i have used it a few times this year .
 the buses in my area will not allow a passenger on without a mask ,  and in my limited experience i didn’t see anyone arguing the policy .
 if i send you pictures of my cats is that actually what you want ?
 i saw a lot of folks say  &apos;don &apos;t let fear run your life !
  &apos; or  &apos;why are you so afraid &apos; .
 i just compare it to a seatbelt .
  i &apos;m not afraid of driving or riding in a car ,  but i still put on a seatbelt ,  just in case ,  just to be safe ,  even though they &apos;re a little uncomfortable .
  now i &apos;m doing the same with a mask .
 they tend to just double down on insisting it &apos;s not real .
 you can &apos;t rationalize like that with some covid deniers
 no you don &apos;t just look silly you &apos;re living in fear and living in fear is weakness !
 most people dont have the luxury
 my so used to do that when i used to rant about how terrible everything was .
  he &apos;d ask if i was cold and bring me a blanket .
  if i kept going he &apos;d get another one .
  eventually i &apos;d be draped in blankets and laughing at the absurdity of the situation .
  it &apos;s a pleasant ,  low-key way to indicate to people that you like them but are not about to put up with their bullshit .
 also it confuses the heck out of people who were prepared for something completely different ,  and that entertains the heck out of me .
  even when i &apos;m the recipient .
 do flat earthers not fly in planes then ?
 cause that technology requires the earth is round
 just last night someone said to me  &apos;hospitals every year around the holidays are overflowing with flu patients ,  so how can it be covid ?
  &apos; i said  &apos;you believe in the flu ?
  &apos; they shut up real quick
  &apos;oh ,  i &apos;m not wearing a mask because of the fake disease .
 i &apos;m wearing it because the government manufactured this pandemic narrative to get us to wear masks made out cloth that is laced with toxic chemicals that spread around like spores when we breathe out .
 the chemicals are meant to subdue us and make us more docile .
 now that everyone &apos;s wearing this toxic cloth ,  the spores are all over the place .
 my mask is made of a material that &apos;s resistant to those chemicals .
 it &apos;s a special kind of cotton .
 i highly recommend making your own mask from cloth you have at home so you &apos;re safe from other people &apos;s mask spores .
  &apos;you believe birds are robots ?
 pfff ,  come back to me when you &apos;ve seen a dinosaur painstakingly glue their feathers on .
 ooooooo i like this !
  &apos;psh as if we could ever escape the simulation and get to the real earth &apos;
 i’m very sorry about whatever the fuck her problem is .
 i hope your dad feels better soon !
 the toothbrush thing doesn’t work by the way .
 myth busters did an experience with placing toothbrushes in different places in a bathroom (including a cupboard) then testing all of them afterwards .
 faecal matter on all of them .
 and if it’s in the air ,  you’re breathing it in anyway my dude .
 i haven &apos;t yet heard any good counter-argument against the seatbelt analogy .
 it &apos;s almost like putting a thin piece of cloth over your face is not the dramatic debilitating sacrifice which transforms you into a zombie slave as claimed by the anti-maskers; who woulda thought lol .
 fyi you still brush with fecal matter unless your cabnet is airtight .
 check out the mythbusters episode .
 apparently their opinions aren &apos;t very valuable if they think that .
 i’m in the same boat ,  only 2 .
 5 months pregnant but my mil even called today to complain to my husband because we said if they are going to visit for christmas they have to quarantine and if they go to the extended family christmas celebration ,  they can’t come back .
 she says she’s frustrated .
 it’s like ,  of course you are ,  so i am and almost everyone else in the world but that doesn’t give you free license to do whatever the fuck want .
 i hear the argument ,  “you’ve gotta live though .
 ” umm ,  i’ve been pregnant before and didn’t drink ,  smoke ,  or take medications and instead suffered through months of sobriety and pain for the interest of the baby .
 it’s a short time .
 people are so short sighted and selfish ,  it’s astounding .
 lpt: add cheese and small extras (chicken ,  beef ,  whatever &apos;s lying around) ,  crimp the edges of the tortilla ,  and stick in a toaster on 2 .
 you keep your crimps tite ,  and you have 2-min quesadillas for days .
 to those with me ,  i welcome you !
 to those against me .
 op talked about how we cope with covid safety-idiots ,  not household-safety idiots .
 i am the latter .
 i’m high and drooling at this .
 i &apos;m cultivating mass !
 i hated them in summer ,  but now i think it &apos;s kind of nice to have a little face warmer .
 plus i end up blowing warm air into my eyes which relieves winter dryness .
 yeah ,  i walked to the grocery store earlier this evening ,  and wore it even when i was alone and outside because it was nice for keeping my face warm .
 it &apos;s nice to not get weird looks over it .
 i’m thinking i might just continue to mask up even after this is over .
  i like being in my own little bubble .
  no need to smile at everyone ,  fawning all over the place to make everyone else happy and so that they will accept me .
  masks make me invisible ,  which i find i really like .
 every time i’m watching something and they go into a crowded place ,  my first instinct is to think ‘yikes’ & then i remember the past where that was the norm
 masks don’t work .
 this one drives me nuts .
 it’s like ,  you know how surgeons have worn masks for the last 100 years or so ?
 it wasn’t because they all fell for some liberal conspiracy .
 we have a store where i’m at like that too .
 the employees don’t wear masks so all the people that don’t believe in masks shop there maskless .
 but it’s like the one store in town so all the other people either feel really uncomfortable in there or drive an hour to the next store
 holy moly i &apos;m glad i don &apos;t live in such a proud-to-be-stupid country .
 i live in australia and the vast majority of the people got on with it because that &apos;s what we had to do .
 now we have basically no covid .
 i wish you a speedy recovery !
 hey can i ask a question .
 do you guys still sleep in the same bed ?
 my partner and i rent a bedroom and god forbid one of us gets covid ,  there will be not be anywhere for either of us to sleep outside of our room so ,  is it doable to sleep in the same room ?
 i really like this term
 been doing this for at least the last decade now
 for what it &apos;s worth anyone who believes they are going to be chipped doesn &apos;t know the science behind actual chip technology .
 they think it &apos;s a gps .
 extra words because i &apos;m bad at acronyms
 what i would be inclined to suggest to these guys is: hey ,  you know how the government and corporations spends billions on facial recognition so they can track you in public ?
 who do you think is promoting anti mask information ?
 who do you think wins when you don’t wear a mask ?
 maybe there’s a chance to out conspiracy the conspiracy .
 seriously ,  all of the anti-mask nonsense reminds me of a toddler who &apos;s refusing to put on pants .
 hit the nail squarely on the head .
 only difference is these people are old enough to know better .
 and a large portion of them even have kids ,  too .
 kids that i hope grow up to realize how fucking narcissistic and shitty their parents are/were .
 a sliver of a difference is eventually all the difference there is ,  so i don’t tend to think in terms of “more/less” difficult - what challenges one to live with for is a simple thing for another .
 who struggles elsewhere .
 i’m sorry for your struggles ,  and respect that you’re still here to share the perspective .
 all i can offer is a perspective ,  but happy if it helps .
 joker huffs his gas for fun
 i had a close friend check in on me the other day because she knows i &apos;ve always struggled with depression .
 she said she &apos;s noticed a change in herself where &apos;s she &apos;s just not doing so well at this time ,  and she &apos;s sorry she never really understood it before .
 it was incredibly kind of her to make the connection and reach out ,  but i had to admit that i wasn &apos;t doing quite as bad as she suspected .
 my depression and anxiety may be slightly worse ,  but overthinking and isolating ,  and grocery shopping at 4am to avoid people is just more of the same .
 if i never watched the news ,  my life would probably not feel that different .
 make silly faces1 and wave all you want but hands off .
 1 when masks are no longer needed .
 as a kindergarten teacher ,  i can make plenty of funny faces even with a mask on .
  i had trouble at first but now i just exaggerate my expressions to a cartoony level and my students love it .
 there is no excuse for people trying to touch any children that aren &apos;t your own while out in public .
 yeah ,  like wtf people ?
 you &apos;re a stranger ,  i don &apos;t know you ,  i don &apos;t know what crimes you &apos;re comfortable committing when the law ain &apos;t watching ,  i don &apos;t know how stable you are ,  i don &apos;t want your gangly ass hands coming anywhere near my child you predatory cesspool .
 strangers getting all grabby with random babies weirds me out .
 like ,  even pre-pandemic world ,  i expected a lot more people trying to touch my belly unwarranted .
 not to be cornered in the bread section by an old man who demands to see the baby in the sling i’m wearing .
 and not to have to jut out an elbow to keep some grocery store worker from running their fingers through my sons curly hair .
 plenty of people are lovely and respectful ,  and wave when my son says hi — and i love that .
 but i am so ready to throw hands with the next person who gets too close .
 some asshole touched my kid .
 my husband has a christmas tree stand and i went to give him lunch .
 everything was chill and we were properly distanced .
 all of the sudden ,  dude appears right in front of me and tickled my kid before i could do anything about it .
 luckily he left right after and he was old .
 and i was holding my kid because holy shit i was pissed off .
 i haven &apos;t taken her into stores or anything to keep her safe since march .
 then that happened .
 now i will only bring lunch if there are no customers because i don &apos;t want to deal with that crap .
 i honestly think she &apos;ll be fine since it was brief ,  we were masked (not her though bc she &apos;s too young :() and i took her out of her clothes and washed her up when we got home .
 but man if she gets sick from that i &apos;m going to be so ,  so upset .
 i’ve been to the hospital a lot during this pandemic (high risk pregnancy & delivery + kids with non-covid sickness or injury) and i gotta give mad props to every hospital worker out there .
 keep doing what you’re doing ,  and i’ll keep doing my minuscule part to try to lighten your load .
 omg this is so my mother .
 she was like “it doesn’t concern me” or “it’s just a flu” .
 well imagine her face when she got symptoms and couldn’t leave bed because she could barely breathe and any kind of activity was a challenge .
 i think it got real for her when grandma died because she infected my uncle who then infected grandma because he came to visit when my mother was bedridden .
 suddenly ,  wearing a mask isn’t the government trying to make us wear a muzzle .
 suddenly ,  it’s all real .
 suddenly ,  it’s not a population control experiment .
 i should specify that grandma wasn’t my biological grandma .
 she was a mother of the uncle i mentioned ,  and he is a husband of my mother’s sister .
 we are just very close as a family members .
 i got it back in june and stayed home for a month and my entire family still thinks i just had the flu .
 i have to tell them i was just lucky i didn &apos;t have debilitating breathing problems .
 my family and aunts are foremost in making up reasons to gather .
 a year or so in precaution will not define most people’s “life” but exposing yourself to the elderly and sickly can have it “run their lives”
 they’re hearing the same things i’m hearing ,  just deciding to act differently .
 this is where i disagree ,  there are tons of people just guzzling down propaganda and misinformation .
 i had a good relationship with my dad .
 i even grew up with a chronic illness ,  had radiation treatment as a teenager ,  had to isolate back then because of autoimmune problems .
 and i thought he understood .
 he seemed to back then .
 but something changed in less than a decade .
 he just doesn &apos;t get it .
 and its ruined our relationship because he &apos;s been really irresponsible ,  tried to convince me to travel ,  sends me things he finds convincing but are just flat out propaganda .
 i just don &apos;t understand why that generation has just been so psychologically altered .
 i always thought he was smart and kind ,  but the disinformation really changed him and i don &apos;t know what to make of it .
 was he always this way ,  and this just brought out his bad qualities ?
 does the psychological war we are in really alter people on a fundamental level ?
 is this just what happens to some people when they get old ?
 i don &apos;t get it ,  but i hate it
 i have been so surprised and utterly speechless by the behaviour of people i considered smart ,  intelligent ,  educated people .
 i &apos;ve definitely cut a few contacts out of my life .
 to me it speaks more to the blatant ignorance for other people .
 me first ,  and as long as i &apos;m fine ,  to hell with everyone else .
 and refusal to amend your views based on new evidence .
 i can’t take the anti-maskers .
 my bf’s mom started wearing masks in public before it was recommended .
 she was made fun of for doing so .
 her doctor recommended her wearing a mask because she had a cancerous tumor the size of an orange in her lung .
 there is no way she would’ve survived with covid .
 i like this strategy .
 if you can &apos;t beat them ,  you join them and then beat them .
 my sister is an icu nurse who will be getting the first round of vaccines when her hospital has them available ,  despite there being a lot of risks .
 people keep blessing her for her hard work while denying her struggles amd obvious ptsd from what is happening because it &apos;s  &apos;not that bad &apos; .
 ive been losing my temper and have been throwing it in their faces by saying true american patriots wear masks and do whats best for their community .
 true patriots honor those working on the front lines .
 true patriots will be outraged that hospitals and healthcare facilities have been treating their staff as desposable during this whole pandemic .
 it &apos;s been a very trying time for us .
 most of the year it &apos;s not been so bad but with  &apos;cold and flu &apos; season starting ,  along with the fact that we live in a state that has had a huge surge in covid cases (mostly because of dickheads not taking the shit seriously) ,  it &apos;s starting to get a little harder for us .
 i feel really bad for my son .
 he &apos;s only 8 and hasn &apos;t played with other kids his age in months .
 and since his mom is a nurse who works with covid patients we &apos;re reluctant to let him play with other kids even if he wears a mask .
 thanks for your work - it’s really a hard ,  thankless job .
 i have an aunt who lives in a group home .
 their protocol (we found out later) was to lock them all in their rooms when someone had covid .
 things like that happen when there’s confusion and absolutely zero leadership .
 i resonate with this post .
 i &apos;ve struggled medically my whole life and had people feign support but a lot of those same people are not willing to take precautions in their own day to day life .
 then get sad when i won &apos;t see them .
 i &apos;ve stopped logging into social media other than reddit daily because i &apos;ve lost enough in 2020 .
 i was inpatient for five days with crohn &apos;s last month .
 i &apos;m on a new medication that obliterates my immune system and i also have a congenital heart defect .
 this isn &apos;t my first rodeo and i &apos;ve suffered worse .
 but if i suffered this much just to be taken out by some asshole months before a vaccine is available .
 the thought makes me so angry .
 losing friends i &apos;ve had for decades angry .
 i wonder the same thing .
 i will never be able to forget this anger or disappointment .
 i will never be able to forget that i was treated as disposable because i have underlying health issues .
 i don’t know where this anger will go but i know that i will not ever be able to see people the same way again .
 if i didn &apos;t quit drinking a decade ago i would deadass have killed myself by alcoholism this year .
 i don &apos;t know how you normies are doing it but god fucking speed .
 they are nurses in a mental hospital so pretty much the most stressful job there is in our workplace i think .
 it’s affecting me a lot more than usual lately ,  in the past month i’ve lost 32 patients and counting ,  and nearly all of them did all the right things .
 social distanced ,  wore masks ,  limited any time around others ,  etc and all it took was one selfish family member to put a death sentence on their head .
 at that point you call security to escort the fucking idiot out the door .
 but my mil was all  &apos;idk anyone who &apos;s had it .
 they &apos;re inflating the numbers .
 my favorite response is this: i don &apos;t know anyone personally who has cancer ,  but common sense dictates that there are people who have cancer ,  and there are people dying of cancer .
 i didn’t know anyone personally until now ,  but i didn’t ignore the fact that over a million people have died worldwide or the millions infected .
  i don’t understand how people have so little empathy for others .
 that amount of suffering breaks my heart .
 like fully throwing a fit ?
 just because you were wearing a mask ?
 goddamn i’m glad i don’t live in rural us
 sounds about right :/ i &apos;m in north idaho ,  almost everyone i know here has been harassed for wearing masks .
 i &apos;m glad i don &apos;t go out much these days because a ton of the people in this town have been acting totally insane all year .
 when the mask mandate (that only like half the people here follow) was announced i saw videos of full grown adults literally screaming and crying about it
 a table of people coughed at me .
 that should be a crime .
 my friend ,  your country is bizarre .
 where i live if you go to a big supermarket you will be  &apos;lucky &apos; to see just 1 person without one .
 why are masks made in to a political issue in the usa it makes no sense ?
 yeah they say shit like “i’m dying from a pneumonia not covid !
 ” and it’s like ,  you got that pneumonia because you have covid !
 i have no problem believing that .
 i was in an accident almost 5 years ago and have screws in my spine and chronic nerve pain - i still try to do things i &apos;ve always done and get punished for it (like lifting +5kg of groceries) .
 i &apos;m not sure why people (and me) are like this ,  it &apos;s like you are so used to things being ok that your stupid ape brain can &apos;t phantom things being different now - guess it &apos;s because if you were to accept it you would also accept you are less than you used to be and that you were wrong .
 i wonder what the response would be if you told that patient ,   &apos;we have found evidence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome presenting of the crown viral family that is impacting your ability to breathe .
 i will tell her exactly this ,  thank you  .
 you guys asked for an update ,  i finally got a hold of her ,  she &apos;s staying at my sister &apos;s to watch her cat while they &apos;re out of town for the holidays (they own property in the woods ,  the only other living creatures they will see besides wildlife are the free range cows from the ranch down the way) and they &apos;re in a dead zone so she has problems getting connected enough for a call sometimes .
 i told her many of the things you guys had suggested and mostly there was lots of crying .
 she thought i was mad at her (she &apos;s got a lot of anxiety and inner demons) so i was sending her silly videos and photos of my son all weekend .
 she loved them and just wanted to say over and over how much she missed us .
 we had a video chat and she got to play with my son for a little bit before bedtime .
 there &apos;s an amazon echo show sale going on right now ,  we &apos;re going to try to scrape together enough to get one for my son and one for her so they can see each other easily more often .
 thank you all for your kind words and advice .
 i &apos;m sorry to everyone who is missing family and friends this holiday season because we &apos;re all doing the right thing .
 it makes it even harder watching others break the rules and live the normal lives we miss so much .
 i fear for the next two weeks as the effects of these super-spreader thanksgiving gatherings begins to unfold .
 i &apos;m so exhausted of living in survival mode and i know i &apos;m not alone .
 unfortunately this isn &apos;t going to be over any time soon .
 kinda similar scenario happened to a friend of mine .
 he lives in a shared apartment and one of his housemates didn &apos;t believe in the virus .
 it &apos;s all a hoax and it &apos;s just a common cold etc .
 then one day ,  my friend got covid from his girlfriend and was tested positive for it and coughing pretty badly .
 suddenly the guy was all like  &apos;don &apos;t come near me !
 stay in your room !
 i feel like i shouldn &apos;t have to say this but don &apos;t cough on anyone ,  even for a joke .
 you may be asymptomatic and still contagious .
 listen: the answer is always yes .
 (leeroy is too cute and what a great name !
 i am always down for pics of pets !
 agreed ,  but good on them for using their “luxury” by taking a stand that could help protect other people at the business who don’t have the ability to walk out .
 if you are seeking logic from those who espouse that particular viewpoint i must warn you ,  you’ll leave dissatisfied .
 or if someone says masks are the government trying to control people ,  tell them the government put that out there so people can’t stop them from using facial recognition technology using ring and other security cameras .
 i could use this ,  my masks are homemade .
 then you start selling special spore protection masks .
 everybody knows birds don &apos;t even exist .
 this comment should be on a sympathy card .
 scott atlas is a comic book villan tier name .
 i think people fall into conspiracy theories as a coping mechanism .
 this invisible entity that has taken over our lives and shut everything down and completely out of our control is a pretty big mental pill to swallow .
 buying into these theories gives you an outlet for the anxiety and helps you gain back some control .
 i sort of take the high school gym class method of coping: you have to be here regardless so you might as well make the most of it .
 i have bought decent masks ,  limit my excursions ,  and keep in mind that things i want to do can wait until this is over .
 educated and intelligent simply are not the same .
 psychology plays into it so much .
  there are intelligent people who will ignore everything in front of their eyes and cling to whatever worldview aligns with what they want to believe because intelligence and education don &apos;t always go hand in hand with the ability to directly handle very distressing thoughts and emotions .
 also ,  be careful not to confuse education (and doctorates) with intelligence .
 there are plenty of incredibly smart people with multiple graduate degrees ,  but there are also plenty of people with graduate degrees who are only well-studied and educated in their respective field and lack common sense ,  street smarts ,  or any knowledge about any subject outside of what they got their degree in .
 there are also people who got graduate degrees from straight-up degree mills or terrible schools or who were allowed to coast through school for other reasons .
 even with doctors who have ,  of course ,  done multiple rotations that doesn &apos;t mean they automatically understand how their own mind is capable of twisting things to tell them what they want to hear or are experts in things outside their speciality .
 what it does translate to is others more willing to listen to them ,  as you pointed out .
 and it isn &apos;t uncommon for someone with a phd or md to assume they have more knowledge than they do .
  actually it isn &apos;t uncommon for the average person to do that .
  there was a study awhile ago (don &apos;t ask me to find the citation because it has been so long since i &apos;ve read it) where people were given a list of topics and asked to indicate their level of expertise .
 then people were given a smart phone to hold and asked to rank their expertise on the same list of topics .
  just holding the smart phone made people more likely to claim expertise in things that they previously did not have expertise in .
 we are very capable of fooling ourselves in regards to how much we do and don &apos;t know ,  especially when our minds want to be fooled .
 think about how much safer you &apos;d feel if you thought covid-19 was a hoax and the biggest threat in your life was shopkeepers trying to make you put on a mask .
 even if you translate your fear into fear of people who want to make you wear masks ,  that level of denial is still way more pleasant than feeling like covid-19 is looming and out of your control .
 that &apos;s precisely why anti-mask wearers make such a big deal about others trying to  &apos;control &apos; them by making them wear a mask .
 they know on some level that it is about control (all of us not having much control over a scary pandemic/ virus) ,  but they want to feel in control .
 covid-19 is something they don &apos;t have complete control over and feeling that is far too distressing for them .
 so they shift this to  &apos;i &apos;m in control of my choices &apos; which allows them to feel less disempowered in the moment ,  and  &apos;others are trying to control/disempower me by making me where a mask &apos; which allows them to channel that feeling of powerlessness in the face of covid-19 into powerlessness at an enemy they think they can fight back against by simply refusing to put on a mask .
 now ,  in their mind ,  they are the strong and independent fighter and free-thinker who knows better against the mask wearing sheep rather than the lost and vulnerable person at the mercy of a global virus that anyone can get sick and die from who does not yet ,  like most of us ,  have the knowledge to fully protect themselves .
 the truth is ,  while we are learning ,  we don &apos;t yet know everything there is to know about covid-19 and a lot of (though not all of) the learning that has happened has happened in non-traditional ways (aka ,  outside of a textbook or peer-reviewed study) .
 that &apos;s a really uncomfortable and psychologically distressing fact ,  especially for people who are used to being able to readily access information and learn everything about something .
 it feels so much better to say  &apos;i know this isn &apos;t a threat &apos; than  &apos;this may be a threat and i don &apos;t yet know enough about it .
  &apos;  anyone who isn &apos;t good at coping with unwanted emotions and instead seeks to avoid them (which is a lot of people) is going to be tempted by the feelings that come with  &apos;i know this isn &apos;t a threat .
 there was this movie called the ice storm with elijah wood and his character says something that i think about a lot:  .
 “because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies .
 like when you smell things ,  because when you smell a smell it &apos;s not really a smell ,  it &apos;s a part of the object that has come off of it ,  molecules .
 so when you smell something bad ,  it &apos;s like in a way you &apos;re eating it .
 this is why you should not really smell things ,  in the same way that you don &apos;t eat everything in the world around you because as a smell ,  it gets inside of you .
 so the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there ,  remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating .
 didn &apos;t they even have a toothbrush in the break room with a glass cover on it ,  and it still had fecal matter on it ?
 stuff is everywhere .
 there was a lot of resistance to seatbelts too when the government first started trying to introduce seatbelt laws .
 the similarities to the mask  &apos;debate &apos; are almost eerie .
 massive amounts of complaints saying it was government overreach ,  that they were uncomfortable ,  or even dangerous .
 do you mean a toaster oven because sticking a quesadilla in a vertical toaster seems like trouble
 nah man ,  butter the tortillas and pan fry .
 i &apos;d burn my damn house down using a toaster .
 good way to start a small grease fire in ur toaster .
 please don &apos;t throw water on a toaster that &apos;s plugged in even if its on fire .
 get a toaster oven like an adult .
 or a foreman grill/panini press .
 me too until i thought he said dick-shaped tater tots .
 tries to read comment but can &apos;t see through the fog damn glasses .
 we refer to it as the before times .
 this is my reaction also ,  but after remembering that was what it used to be like ,  i also think about things going back to that ,  and how nice that &apos;ll be
 my friend and i have a running joke of taking pictures of movies where people are in crowded spaces or touching a bunch of random things and sending it to each other with the caption ,   &apos;remember when we did this &apos; .
 there was a car thief in our area who got caught by a red light camera with his mask down under his chin .
 not the brightest thief ever .
 they &apos;re career criminals ,  not evil libruls .
 have some respect .
 it always gives me an extra giggle .
 i saw one where 2 guys robbed a gas station wearing their masks around their chins .
 so fucking sad .
 as if greedy hospitals and private practice docs trying to make ends meet would waste money on some shit that doesn &apos;t work ,  and do so for a century ?
 but viruses are smaller than the holes in the mask fibers .
 uuuuhhh not how aerosolized particles work .
 but they &apos;ll drop your o2 levels to deadly levels .
 as if there &apos;s been exacly zero asthmatic nerds becoming doctors ?
 maybe surgeons performing surgery on anti-maskers shouldn’t wear masks because it doesn’t work .
 i think what these people don &apos;t understand is that masks are supposed to protect others from you ,  not the other way around .
 ive got a freind whos mom made him come back from australia because she was scared australia wouldnt handle it well ,  boy was she wrong .
 i live in australia ,  and the number of people wearing masks has dropped .
 we aren &apos;t out of the woods yet ,  and a wrong move could ruin all the hard work .
  prevention is better than cure .
 uh ,  you can’t really claim that some australians aren’t proud to be stupid .
 lived and loved being there ,  but definitely saw it with my own eyes .
  you know ,  all countries have their bogans ,  who are proud to be so .
 yeah but y &apos;all are used to everything in the country trying to kill you .
 it &apos;s just another thursday for you .
 honestly if y &apos;all are sleeping in the same bed ,  odds are whoever wasn &apos;t infected first would catch it before the other person really started to show symptoms .
 from harvard medical school ,   &apos;emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms .
 i hate to be a debbie downer here but in all likelihood if you both sleep in the same bed every night then if one of you gets it the other probably will have contracted it before you even are aware of it .
 my wife was tested positive last month ,  we continued to sleep together because by the time she knew she had covid it was too late already (test took 10 days because they were overwhelmed .
 ) and it was not possible for us to stay separated ,  even more with our 5 yo son .
 so we slept together (though i &apos;ve spent two nights on a couch because she was too agitated for me to sleep) and luckily i &apos;ve never developped symptoms ,  neither did my son .
 but i guess it would be advised to sleep separately if possible and if you &apos;re diagnosed soon enough .
 honestly a really great response .
 30 years of driving and not a scratch here (apart from parking damage caused by others) .
 my instructor thought me to drive defensively and - this saved me numerous times and saved my ass from dying once- look ahead and back .
 not just two or three cars ahead but look ahead as far as you can to form an idea of what traffic there will be up ahead .
 check your rear view mirror often too .
 saved and saves me from getting involved in accidents as for example people not paying attention up ahead are easy to spot and avoid .
 the rear view mirror thing saved me from being crushed by a truck (lorry ,  big truck) at the end of a traffic jam .
 was able to get on the hard shoulder right in time .
 others weren &apos;t so lucky that day :-( .
 the sound of crumpling cars still haunts me .
 global global positioning system ?
 most people who actually believe the chip theory have absolutely no reason the government would want to spy on them .
  i’m sure our government has better people to spy on .
 and the data storage that it would need if it were global gps to actually be able to track you .
 not enough terabytes of data for police body cams ,  but somehow we have enough for everyone all day ,  every day ,  for infinite amounts of time ?
 or a general lack of critical thinking and self reflection .
 an optimistic one you are
 because if i was there ,  i would be a worry wart .
 that’s no fun when your at a party or a bar anxious as all hell .
 i’ll drink for now to the parties of next year !
 i get primally predatory whenever a stranger is near my kids .
 my internal monologue is always something to the extent of: .
 “i don’t know you ,  i don’t trust you ,  but i know and trust my ability to break those fucking fingers if you don’t keep them in your own personal bubble .
 then i see the semi-recent stories of strangers intentionally coughing on kids because they were pissed at the parents ,  and i know in my heart i would have committed a murder .
 seems like i’ve killed me mum and this isn’t a scamdemic .
 holy fuck ,  not to be insensitive but can you imagine killing your mom because mask hurty facey ?
 and then having to just live with that ?
 so how does she feel about wearing masks now ?
 yeah but they’re also reading/seeing the normal stuff too and then choosing to seek out the conspiracies .
 i’ve got one of those that tries to spew the craziness at me .
 to me ,  there’s just nothing to say to someone who wants to believe those things .
 i think the approach might be different from person to person though .
 i’m not even going to lie ,  i’m burnt out .
 so some of this is coming from choosing what’s best for me and some is from straight up apathy .
 who even knows anymore lol .
 the misinformation has convinced him you are the unkind one .
 you are being manipulative ,  and you don &apos;t live in the same reality as him .
 i hope she &apos;s doing okay that sounds horrid 
 another good line like this:  .
  &apos;i wear a mask because i &apos;m a christian .
 i care about people and don &apos;t want to contribute to more people suffering and dying .
 ive found saying  &apos;260 , 000 dead americans &apos; to be more effective  than  &apos;260 , 000 people have died .
 they need to hear  &apos;dead americans &apos; to care at all ,  and even then it barely registers .
 i’ve been a bartender for years ,  so i’ve seen how trash humans can be .
 this took it to a whole new level .
 i’ve almost completely lost faith in humanity this year .
 i &apos;ve been lucky enough to live in a legal state and can dampen my drinking by smoking .
 but yeah ,  if i lived in an illegal state still i doubt i &apos;d have survived this year .
 congrats on your sobriety friend ,  its an incredible achievement
 you &apos;d think nurses would know better .
 i ,  too ,  am angry af .
 during the first wave i was working as a float dns and ended up in a heavily impacted snf in upstate ny .
 26 years of nursing did not prepared me for what would happen .
 it’s was akin to what i think 3rd world nursing is like .
 70% of the residents were infected double  digit deaths and hospitalized staff members .
 i left that position because i had decided when i hit it big as a dns ,  i would never  ask someone to do what i was unwilling to do myself and i just didn’t want to do it anymore .
 my non nursing friends and my husbands family think that i have ptsd (which i might) but i am sorry ,  i am not going out for margaritas or coming to anyone’s house for any reason and no ,  you can’t come to mine .
 i go on absolutely essential errands and never directly after work .
 i don’t know how being cautious (ok ,  fine extremely cautious) during a fucking pandemic turned into being a sheep or living a fearful life .
 i am not afraid of getting covid ,  i just don’t want to and more importantly i don’t want to spread it to anyone else .
 laying  in bed with someone .
 while you are dressed in full ppe while they are taking their last breaths on facetime with their husband of 54 years sobbing sucks harder than you can imagine .
 why would you not want to wear a mask ?
 how did this become political ?
 fuck all ya’ll for just not being a good human .
 i wish you all the best .
 imo it comes down to a specific problem with empathy and ,  like ,  object permanence .
 they have a hard time conceptualizing that other people ,  who they have never met ,  are real people just like them .
 this is it exactly .
 even if you don &apos;t know someone personally ,  it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not happening .
 it is just infuriating that for many people ,  if it isn &apos;t in their bubble then it &apos;s irrelevant .
 the odds of knowing someone who has died from covid is extremely slim .
 not dismissing your argument ,  just saying that most people won &apos;t experience a death of someone they know .
 i walked by her ,  and her five young daughters ,    and she said  &apos;oh honey ,  you don &apos;t need to wear that .
  &apos; i said  &apos;its actually really important that we all do &apos; .
 then i walked away towards my car .
 she followed ,  screaming something incoherent about masks and being sheep .
 they were all maskless .
 the girls looked embarrassed .
 we actually passed her in traffic later on and she screamed out her window that i was a bastard .
 a true role model for her kids .
 i think it has been made a crime in a bunch of countries
 you do that to me ,  you get a fist to the face .
 not exaggerating ,  not trying to look badass here ,  but if you actually cough on me without a mask you’re endangering not just me ,  but my elderly parents and my high risk girlfriend and her family as well and just the thought of it has me seeing red .
 i refuse to let something like that pass .
 chances of that happening here in belgium are pretty low ,  but damn if it doesn’t get me mad that there’s actually people out there who do that .
 if spitting is considered assault why not purposeful ,  projected coughing ?
 people in my state have been charged with making terroristic threats for intentionally coughing on others .
 like ,  making a scene level coughing and yelling ,  though .
 it really makes zero sense ,  except when you realize the sitting president of the country is a conspiracy theorist .
 these people trust him because he &apos;s not part of the  &apos;deep state &apos; (a term that i think just means career politicians  ?
 ) so anything he says ,  they &apos;ll believe .
 i don &apos;t know when we got so polarized or why everything became political ,  but it sure is a tangled mess .
 our lack of education as a nation is starting to show i think .
 i &apos;ll also add ,  there &apos;s been a lot of economic problems for blue-collar workers with globalization ( &apos;they took our jobs !
  &apos;) ,  income inequality is absurdly high ,  and the moral landscape of the country is changing .
 people who were formally served by or bought into a  &apos;great america &apos; are feeling the effects of poor management .
 from all sides .
 so to put it simply ,  there &apos;s a distrust in the system ,  or at least the people who &apos;ve been running it for the last few decades .
 they see trump as the  &apos;outsider with some sense &apos; ,  so they trust him more than scientists (cause  &apos;doctors are all hacks anyway ,  you know ?
 not enough scientific education from the get go .
 evangelical christianity also a big determinant of people &apos;s entitlement .
 it is very sad and dangerous .
 like still living in the dark ages .
 i mean i live in the middle of the usa and can &apos;t remember the last time i saw someone without a mask on in public - although i see the occasional nose sticking out .
 why are masks made in to a political issue in the usa it makes no sense ?
 i have no idea and it &apos;s absolutely insane .
 but the comments in this thread are nothing like my experience living in a medium sized city in the middle of the country .
 i haven &apos;t seen anyone maskless in a store for months and no confrontations about masks whatsoever .
 it &apos;s not at all controversial .
 but based on reddit and news stories ,  i know it &apos;s not the same everywhere .
 it really does feel like one country living in two alternate realities sometimes .
 as for why ,  i think it comes down to trump &apos;s downplaying the virus in the spring coupled with the effectiveness of social media at spreading conspiracies .
 if we had a different republican as president ,  like a bush ,  i have to wonder how different things could be right now .
 i &apos;d like to think it would be more like australia (strong right/left divide ,  but largely put aside their differences to fight covid) .
 the saner states aren &apos;t like that .
 in mine ,  masks are mandated to be in any business ,  and people have been complying .
 i don &apos;t know any disease experts but i have a bunch of work acquaintances in china and was having to deal with the fallout when they all started going into lockdown .
 they were locking millions of people in their houses and rush-building emergency hospitals while our people were on tv telling us not to worry ,  it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
 my kid was pulled out of preschool in mid february because i was getting daily updates from my friends that were in the middle of it (i also have a trauma disorder that makes me hyper vigilant against perceived threats ,  so being bat shit worked out in my favor this time lol) .
 i mean after living through the mad cow ,  bird flu ,  swine flu  &apos;pandemics &apos; (not saying they weren &apos;t deadly ,  just not in proportion to the media coverage) i still feel i was reasonable to be skeptical of the  &apos;end-is-nigh &apos;-ers ,  at first .
 but this one turned out to be different and i admitted to everyone i professed cynicism to that i was wrong .
 probably more aggression ,  unfortunately .
 plus ,  i understand the sentiment ,  but overcomplicating a diagnosis just to  &apos;fool &apos; the patient goes against my oath as well .
 fortunately ,  though ,  it &apos;s not my responsibility to make a patient believe their diagnosis .
 if they choose to ignore my care or advice ,  i &apos;m free of any burden on their health that results in .
 and tell her thank you if you haven &apos;t yet ,   it &apos;s much more effective than  &apos;it &apos;s ok &apos; in making somebody feel their choice is the right one
 people like that don &apos;t give a shit until it directly effects them ,  like children .
 everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face .
 i don’t think they meant cough on them .
 just make a scene while coughing into your arm .
 sir ,  your username does not ask me to send you cat pics .
 fight conspiracy with conspiracy
 oh shit ,  my anti-government ,  anti-mask coworkers are going to love this
 damn ,  that &apos;s pretty clever .
 somewhat by a lucky coincidence ,  i bought a mask many months before covid became a thing because i would go to industry events and meetings and there were always signs saying they my film for advertising or promo material ,  etc .
 i didn’t like that ,  or the fact that people sometimes just took pictures and i happened to be in them .
 so i started wearing a mask .
 now i have a good reason and can feel more normal doing it .
 that &apos;s a massive brain move .
 and that &apos;s when the big bucks start rolling in
 or worked out in cross stitch .
 i mean i would buy it .
 seriously ,  i know a couple of people that could use this card .
 a kind of smelly smell .
 a smelly smell that smells .
 - eugene crabs ,  may 1st 1999
 according to my ex that &apos;s why you just lay the toaster on it &apos;s side !
 yeah no thanks i &apos;ll make my grilled cheese (or quesadilla in this instance) in a frying pan like a sane person .
 exactly my thought when i read this .
 instead of butter ,  sprinkle some cheese in the pan .
 hot damn them crunchy sons of bitches are delightful
  &apos;i enjoy having breakfast in bed .
 i like waking up to the smell of bacon-sue me-and since i don &apos;t have a butler ,  i have to do it myself .
 so most nights before i go to bed i will lay six strips of bacon out on my george foreman grill .
 then i go to sleep .
 when i wake up ,  i plug in the grill .
 i go back to sleep again .
 then i wake up to the smell of crackling bacon .
 it is delicious .
 it &apos;s good for me .
 it &apos;s the perfect way to start the day .
 if you &apos;re seeing dick everywhere you look ,  the problem may go deeper than you think
 those are better for burritos
 can i give you an awesome tip as a glasses wearer .
 snowmobiling ,  dirtbiking ,  skiing ,  combat deployments ,  etc .
  ,  with glasses (especially with full face protection which fogs up your glasses even quicker/worse) is a bitch -- until you learn how to treat your glasses .
 murphy &apos;s oil soap (the thick shit in the bottle you add to a bucket of water ,  not the spray crap) .
 a little dab on your finger ,  rub your finger and thumb together ,  then rub it all over your lenses ,  don &apos;t rinse them under water ,  just wipe them completely clean afterwards with a microfiber cloth .
 you literally will not get fogged up glasses for hours and hours .
 if you can &apos;t get your grubby little fingers on some murphy &apos;s oil soap ,  just use dish soap (does not work as well ,  but it works) and do exactly the same thing .
 small bit on finger ,  rub it all over both sides of the lenses ,  then wipe it off (dry) completely (so you don &apos;t see it at all) and you &apos;re mint .
 the long long ago
 this triple-infuriates me !
 burglary in general .
 the stupidity of not knowing that face masks is a disguise !
 they both don &apos;t block viruses but do block o2 molecules ,  which are apparently larger than the virus or something .
 laughing so hard at the asthmatic nerds part .
 i am that asthmatic nerd
 oh they understand that ,  they just hold beliefs somewhere on the spectrum between  &apos;i &apos;m invincible &apos; and  &apos;it &apos;s statistically unlikely &apos; ,  coupled with  &apos;that &apos;s their problem &apos; .
 i &apos;m in korea and in february everyone asked me if i &apos;d move back to the us .
 it seemed silly to give up my job ,  but in retrospect man i was right to stay here .
  &apos;all countries have their bogans &apos;  .
 this should be the global motto .
 you don &apos;t live long if you believe deadly dropbears are a labour conspiracy .
 yes ,  this is all great advice !
 another one that took me years to learn (just by maturing) ,  is to not make driving into a “competition” or power play .
 if someone is being a jerk on the road ,  let it go - and let them go ,  too .
 just tonight i was talking to someone about my commute ,  which involves driving on a notoriously dangerous road (17 between santa cruz & san jose ,  ca) .
 he said the other drivers scare him more than the road itself ,  to which i replied that the best way to deal with them is to get the hell out of their way .
 doesn’t matter if i’m going 80mph; if someone behind me wants to go 90 ,  i move tf over and let them go .
 not worth challenging them and putting both of our lives at risk .
 i’ll let them take their own risks without dragging me into it .
 this has motivated me to pay attention to my mirror in traffic
 global gps system
 you right ,  it &apos;s 2am and i got to the hospital at 5am ,  brain is dead  .
 they also typically post their trash conspiracies on data mining social media sites using their chipped up the wazoo smartphone that’s already harvesting and selling their data .
 why secretly chip you when you’ll buy the device with your own money and make sure it stays charged and connected at all times ?
 china created covid to hurt our economy ?
 no ,  china created the anti-mask anti-vax media to let us all get sick and die and weaken the economy !
 understanding fully that my pov is insensitive ,   but i hope it haunts these people forever at this point .
 it &apos;s one thing to have done all you can to be safe and have something go wrong anyways .
 it &apos;s another entirely to disregard all medical advice because  &apos;men on tv say covid a hoax ,  so i won &apos;t do the bare minimum to not be gross and spread a plague .
 can &apos;t scare me libs !
  &apos; until you indirectly kill your family .
 i have no sympathy left for these people .
 she now understands that it’s important to have one and actually wear it properly ,  not under your nose .
 she humbled much during this week .
 i could present my dad with a binder full of peer reviewed studies ,  and if it doesn &apos;t corroborate whatever trump said ,  then it &apos;s  &apos;fake news ,  &apos; or the researchers were bought off by the liberal propaganda machine .
 the mental gymnastics are astounding .
 she unfortunately passed away at the end of august .
 her cancer was everywhere .
 she was never covid positive though
 this is so good .
 “because jesus would be wearing a mask .
 what i learned from the pandemic is that not everyone should be a nurse
 i’ve been thinking about this a lot recently especially regarding the us election .
 the same people who don’t wear masks because “i’ve never seen anyone with covid” are also posting these pics on twitter of a trump rally beside a second picture of biden giving a speech to some family and friends .
 they always say “you cannot tell me that this man who can’t even pull a crowd was somehow elected president over our geotus” .
 one time it was just a picture of a trump speech to the army .
 there were a lot of people in the stands ,  but you kinda have to assume that most of them were there mandatorily since it is the military .
 the status was something like “but trump supposedly ‘lost’ the military vote” .
 these people legitimately have the brain development of a 4 year old and it’s just weird .
 how do you argue with someone who can’t understand that the wide ,  short glass holds as much water as the tall ,  skinny glass ?
 how do you argue with a literal child ?
 holy shit ,  the culture you have there will never cease to amaze me .
 i think i could at least understand her perspective if she simply wasn’t worried ,  but that woman was actually furious because you were taking a precaution that from her perspective was unnecessary .
 it’s like getting mad at someone for being too nervous to go on a roller coaster ,  like even if the fear is unfounded it’s not like it affects her personally .
 hang in there mate ,  keep staying safe ,  you’re doing the right thing .
 you and those poor kids all have my sympathy .
 based on a few replies i read i just want to clarify that i don’t mean to generalise to all americans ,  i’m aware that the majority of you are perfectly reasonable people .
 why are these people so angry ?
 i know one youtuber who was arrested for fake-coughing over all the deli meat for reactions .
 was like $20k meat thrown away
 it already was a crime .
 if you cough on someone ,  close enough to get spittle on them ,  in most countries that &apos;s assault .
 most people ,  under normal circumstances ,  would just go  &apos;bless you &apos; and let it be ,  but covid has changed that and in a bunch of countries it &apos;s been upgraded to some form of aggravated ,  afaik .
 deliberately coughing in someone &apos;s face would deserve a fist to the face even before covid times lol .
 not sure what &apos;s gotten into those people &apos;s heads that they can do that now .
 the silver lining is i think the highest upvoted comments are rather extraordinary circumstances .
 i &apos;m not a lawyer ,  but with the precedence set of people licking and couching on groceries being convicted of multiple felonies ,  one could argue that such protections should extend to our bodies as well; not just the food we eat .
 especially during a respiratory illness pandemic .
 though it should be other times as well .
 covid isn &apos;t the only thing that spreads like that and can be a serious health risk .
 social media also promotes this group think mentality and behavior ,  so it &apos;s a big reason why some people think trump is the anti-christ ,  while others think he was sent by god to rescue babies before they &apos;re killed .
 our lack of education as a nation is starting to show i think .
 i saw a woman in target with her mask below her nose .
 i said ,   &apos;excuse me miss ,  i don &apos;t know if you noticed ,  but your mask slipped .
  &apos; i &apos;ve never felt more alive .
 do you live in a metro ?
 i think people in denser places can &apos;t ignore the realities of covid as easily .
 it &apos;s their hospitals that are being overrun ,  for example .
 being bat shit worked out in my favor this time lol) .
 it &apos;s not paranoia if it works out for you taps forehead
 that’s cool that you have someone on the inside ;)
 i have definitely been doing this .
 back in january when i was pregnant and afraid of this new virus she and my best friend were the only one who didn &apos;t tell me i was overreacting .
 even my husband did for a while .
 they dont care about others period .
 if the virus is a hoax ,  and its all bullshit manufactured by rich politicians so their businesses and stock portfolios could get shit canned ,   then worst case ,  you wear a mask for nothing but demonstrate you care for others enough to forgo your pride and wear a mask .
 if its not ,  then you are a perpetrator in killing and crippling 250k americans cause you did not want to wear a mask
 but i still want them though please .
 there are some fabricated articles out there stating exactly this .
 you could look one up and share it with them .
 tell them antifa figured out the facial recognition part .
 since it was pre-covid ,  i wanted to ask what kind of mask you bought ?
 i am holding out hope it will be a sequined and bejeweled masquerade mask .
 my partner and i got super sick right at the end of december ,  and had picked up some of the cheap disposable masks in order to exist (we were out of town when it hit) .
 in january when we were feeling better i had some nice reusable filter masks in my digital shopping cart ,  just in case .
 but ultimately i thought  &apos;how often are we really gonna need these ?
  &apos; and didn &apos;t buy them .
 i guess the moral is you should make those impulse purchases ?
 i just commissioned my cross stitching friend to make this for me .
 fantastic idea ,  thank you !
 i’m so glad i read your comment .
 odorants aren &apos;t a special class of particles ,  they &apos;re just molecules that are volatile enough to get into the air ,  and that happen to be ones our nose can detect .
 you &apos;re correct that pathogens like bacteria and viruses aren &apos;t transmitted this way ,  but the particles that make it to your nose are some of the exact ones within whatever you &apos;re smelling .
 when you smell paint thinner it &apos;s because actual molecules of paint thinner are making it into your nose with all the same toxicity it normally has ,  not some special particle that carries its odor .
 sideways toasters melt .
 yeah i don &apos;t think we should take random quesadilla advice from this mad man
 oh lord that pan fried cheese under some bread or tortilla on the skillet is a whole other level .
 flavortown wants to visit that place .
 just don &apos;t stick your foot in it
 it definitely goes deeper .
 seems like a hard problem to solve .
 i actually already clean my glasses with dish soap but the effects don &apos;t seems to last too long .
 i’ve heard mixed reports of this damaging the lenses .
 iirc it was either something a protective film or blue light filter that some people claim is eroded by the soap ,  but i’ve seen others claim they haven’t experienced anything like that .
 ‘man if we wear masks in there people are going to think we voted for biden .
 i even heard someone saying that masks are bad and useless because they don &apos;t let the viruses out of your organism so you can infect yourself .
 don &apos;t laugh too hard and trigger an asthma attack
 i am very jealous of you .
 i always say  &apos;i &apos;ll rather have the idiots in front of me than behind me &apos; .
 because should i have to brake suddenly they are so close they &apos;ll surely hit me .
 and yes of course i &apos;m in the right and they &apos;re in the wrong if they hit me ,  but i don &apos;t feel like letting people ruin my car and day because  &apos;i &apos;m right &apos; is worth it .
 always ,  and especially if you approach slow traffic or a traffic jam ,  even more so in unusual places or at unusual times .
 a lot of people really don &apos;t pay attention on the road .
 phones ,  drugs ,  sleep deprivation ,  or simply not paying attention are way too common .
 fuck i had this convo with my father in law the other day .
 i &apos;ve had 17 people who work in my department come up positive .
 he &apos;s on the phone with a friend who mentioned their mutual friend just died of covid .
 i mention a coworker that just died of it .
 mother in law mentions the vaccine and how she &apos;s not sure if she &apos;ll get it because of stuff  &apos;she read on facebook &apos; .
 i try to gently inform them a little bit more about the vaccine and virus in general .
 he chimes in that it &apos;s being overblown just so they can put a microchip in everyone .
 i say  &apos;norman ,  norman .
 why would they need to put a chip in a vaccine when you two are carrying around a device that knows more about you than your parents ,  children ,  significant other ,  more than anyone ?
 you post every fleeting thought you have for christ sake &apos; .
 he responds with a  &apos;well that &apos;s just what i heard on newsmax yesterday &apos; .
 it was at that point i knew i was having thanksgiving at home with my toddler and their daughter .
 i thought it was bad enough he had rush and fox on all day ,  but jesus christ - this disinformation and propaganda is going to cause some huge huge problems sooner than later .
 of course that &apos;s when my mother in law said she updated her iphone and now thinks it is recording her because of a yellow light in the corner of her screen when she &apos;s on the phone .
 i just had to cut it short and say  &apos;ok son ,  time to go home ,  you can see your grandparents another time &apos; .
 may god have mercy on these morons and the collateral damage they cause .
 hey that’s actually possible when you consider 4 years ago russia interferes with the election through spreading false information
 does she feel any guilt for causing grandma &apos;s demise
 because they aren’t operating from a logical mindset ,  so logic won’t work .
 they’re operating from emotion .
 i have never met so many dumb nurses until the pandemic started .
 that woman was actually furious because you were taking a precaution that from her perspective was unnecessary .
 this explanation from another thread is informative: .
 according to the psychologists who study it ,  conspiracist ideation is often associated with low self-esteem and feelings of powerlessness .
 the conspiracist feels empowered by these beliefs because s/he becomes part of an  &apos;elite &apos; who know the  &apos;truth &apos; (what they don &apos;t want you to know !
 this also produces a confirmation bias where they seek the echo chamber of supporting evidence .
 contradictory evidence is dismissed because it is viewed as a personal attack by undermining the thing that gives them power and esteem .
 all of this forms a self-feeding cycle where they not only double-down on their beliefs but become prone to believe in other conspiracies .
 once their insecurities drive them across the initial threshold of irrational thought ,  each additional conspiracy becomes easier to believe .
 lack of opportunity .
 at least thats what i &apos;d like to think .
 i truly believe many are just assholes .
 trump gave assholes options .
 its not a simple problem .
  &apos;fake coughing &apos; only means forced coughing ,  the splutter still comes out ,  i &apos;m glad they made the decision to toss the meat and report him
 it was just a prank ,  bro !
 is probably what he said as he was being arrested .
 instructions unclear dick is now stuck in toaster .
 it &apos;s getting warm fast .
 will update later .
 i honestly forgot what this thread was about when i saw that y’all are talking about quesadillas
 today i got up ,  i stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot .
 i don &apos;t see what &apos;s so hard to believe about that .
 what happens when / if your mask floods ?
 don &apos;t you rinse your eyeballs in soap then ?
 but you &apos;re rinsing them in water ,  right ?
 next time clean them with your dish soap ,  rinse them and dry them .
 then rub just the dish soap on them on both sides (just a tiny bit works) and then wipe it off with a dry cloth .
 it &apos;s the tiny film of the soap that stops the fog .
 if you spend a good amount of money on your lenses ,  please be careful of doing this as the soap will eat away at the coatings and cause them to peel off ,  making your lenses more vulnerable to scratches and breaking .
 patchy coatings also make your lenses difficult to see through because it makes your lenses cloudy .
 the best thing to do would be to invest in anti-fog coatings on your lenses .
 this can be pretty cheap if you order online (sites like zenni ,  firmoo ,  clearly ,  glassesusa ,  eyebuydirect ,  goggles4u .
 just to name a few) .
 the coatings run you up about $15-$20 on top of your frames + lenses .
 but if you don’t want to purchase a new pair of glasses ,  just be careful .
 this is a handy trick but it might cost you your expensive glasses in the long run
 well that person doesn &apos;t need to worry about a mask dropping o2 levels ,  they &apos;re clearly not getting any to their brain anyway .
 like that old saying goes - cemeteries are full of people who had the right of way .
 one time i was stuck on the highway with these two jerks road raging on each other ,  swerving and brake-checking at high speeds .
 i just slowed down to under the speed limit ,  and let them get a safe distance ahead .
 not even worth trying to go around ,  and getting caught up in that bullshit !
 and just like that ,  a thread about avoiding covid became a thread about traffic accidents
 it &apos;s not just possible ,  it &apos;s been documented .
 i think she does .
 but grandma was an almost 91 year old woman ,  so in reality it could’ve been whatever because she was already very sickly .
 that actually explains a lot ,  i’ve never heard of this before .
 now if only conspiracist ideation weren’t killing thousands of americans i’d be excited to learn something new
 explains a lot .
 so what &apos;s the right way to frame a discussion if you have to talk to a conspiracy theorist ?
 convince them that wearing a mask is the real power move ?
 the biggest irony is that people who use the term  &apos;sheeple &apos; are most likely to behave like sheep .
 wish there were an easy way to solve this problem .
 maybe more widespread education in the fields of science and statistics for young children .
 by fake coughing i meant he wasn &apos;t actually having a coughing spasm ,  he was just a douche nozzle ,  who might even have been passing on his asymptomatic covid
 yep ,  biological terrorism .
 just have to be immature here and point out you said  &apos;toss the meat &apos;
  &apos;wanna know how i got these scars ?
 id assume the residue is so thin you wouldnt notice
 tbf ,  there was a time when wearing seatbelts got as many eyerolls as we get for wearing masks now .
 sadly ,  the analogy kinda works .
 i tried to explain that to her ,  but it devolved into the government spying .
 i was also then told that i didn &apos;t install norton correctly on father in law computer because he got a virus and norton made him pay 500 dollars to remove it ,  and his loving daughter had to help him because i didn &apos;t know what i was doing .
 i went to school for computer electronics and network administration .
 i explained that he got scammed .
 he explained that i just didn &apos;t install it right and his stay at home facebook wine mom daughter fixed it ,  and put mcafee on for him because he &apos;ll never use norton again because they &apos;re so expensive .
 my parents generation is by and large incapable of handling any of the technology in today &apos;s world it seems .
 it &apos;s like that blazing saddles scene ,  where sheriff bart is down because the entire town is dumb and racist .
 just simple salt of the earth people the common clay of the new west .
 also ,  thinking about it ,  the topics you &apos;re supposed to be cautious to bring up with strangers are politics and religion ,  because people are so inclined to get angry when challenged on them .
  i think that &apos;s because beliefs on those topics ,  for most people ,  are emotional and not based on enough evidence to solidly justify them .
 and even if one person has done a lot of research and is secure in their beliefs ,  so that they &apos;re not prone to rage when challenged ,  they &apos;re usually dealing with someone else whose beliefs are founded in a handful of half-baked youtube clips ,  and trying to reason with that level of critical thinking ends up being infuriating itself .
 if you have the patience ,  you &apos;re supposed to never directly challenge their beliefs ,  but gradually maintain emphasis on the important of critical thinking ,  and eventually ask questions about the evidence for specific beliefs ,  going gently to avoid triggering defensiveness ,  progressing toward the more wild beliefs slowly ,  never saying they &apos;re wrong but asking about the evidence for them ,  after you &apos;ve established a mutual understanding of the importance of critical analysis .
  (probably that would be more effective if you first used it to debunk left-leaning beliefs that are exaggerated or untrue ,  before pivoting to the stuff on the right .
 that &apos;s a lot of time and patience ,  though .
 i was waiting for this comment lmao
 sir this is a wendys
 plus ,  nothing wrong with a little eyeball soap .
 there’s actually an ad i’ve seen here in the uk a couple of times now that capitalises on this .
 a bunch of people sit on a chair and read out old protest statements about seatbelts like “seatbelts are a violation of my personal freedom” and whatnot .
 right at the end a bit of text appears at the bottom saying “silly ,  isn’t it ?
 wear your mask .
 there’s a similar youtube ad that i’ve run across a few times too .
 ooof ,  yeah it is .
 maybe let’s just not vote them into any offices of political power .
 yeah your username doesn’t give me hope lol
 hey if it’s good enough to wash oil off ducks it’s good enough for my eyes
 so i can move freely when time is frozen ?
 or am i stuck there reading ?
 cuz if it &apos;s the former what &apos;s the problem ?
 if the latter i can learn a lot of skills easily .
 or freeze time by touching clifford and having a nap .
 i cant see a down side either way
  &apos;hey could you hold these textbooks for me ?
 if you &apos;re a very slow learner and a reader ,  and of you touched a book in some other language ,  would you get old till you are done deciphering and reading it ?
 will you go from 10years to 90years in just the flash of normal time ?
 i get to take my time reading ,  absorb all the info ,  and i get enough time to actually read books instead of just skimming !
 so you are telling me that i can freeze time whenever i wish for however long and when i resume time i learn all the knowledge from a book of my choice ?
 hell yes sign me the fuck up .
 it gives me so many opportunities to be by myself .
 i like reading so if i really had to read something even if i accidentally touched it and hated it i would .
 i get to spend hours upon hours by myself and it’s a pretty good way to cheat on tests or steal money or whatever
 so if you accidentally touched a bible for example ,  you &apos;d be stuck frozen in time for like fifty hours ?
 i &apos;m a bit confused about the monkey &apos;s paw fine print of this deal ,  but it doesn &apos;t sound that catastrophic .
 yeah ,  you guys are right - fifty hours is a massive underestimation .
 that would cover the bulk of the old testament ,  but the whole thing is probably closer to eighty hours .
 but hey ,  supernatural speed reading .
 i can effectively teleport by reading a book .
 i am technically immortal as long as i read .
 there &apos;s all the time i ever wanted .
 so you &apos;re saying i instantly deeply and intuitively understand the information contained in the book ,  but as a penalty i then have to actually read the content ,  in the sense of passing my eyes over the actual characters on the page at a normal reading pace ,  even though i already understand it all ?
 sign me the fuck up .
 i would murder so many advanced physics and math books ,  it wouldn &apos;t even be funny .
  the actual reading part is like the least hard part of understanding most of that stuff .
 or hell ,  advanced statistics and machine learning .
 what happens if you touch an ereader/kindle ?
 there is like literally no downside .
 your downside is just the bonus ability to freeze time by touching books
 sounds like nothing but positives to me .
 sure i &apos;d accept it .
 do my bodily functions still work ?
 how frozen is time ?
 can i drink a beer while i read the book ?
 how far from the book can i walk to read the book until time unfreezes ?
 can i freeze time by touching a book ,  walk to another state ,  read it ,  and have traveled to that state for free and instantly ?
 how much can i interact with the frozen world ?
 do i still have to pee/eat/poo while time is frozen ?
 can i sleep or take naps if its a huge book ?
 does it matter if the content is the same/similar but its a different author ?
 like would two copies of the same book require me to read both cover-to-cover even if the only difference is that one of them has a different blurb ,  praise page ,  and a forward ?
 what about books i can &apos;t read because they &apos;re in a different language ?
 is this voluntary ,  or could someone potentially drive me insane by tossing a wheelbarrow of dictionaries at me printed by several different companies in different languages ?
 too many variables ,  i &apos;ll pass .
 do i absorb it as i read it or as i touch it ?
 because your question kind of contradicts itself .
 reddit ,  would you eat a banana for $1 , 000 , 000 , 000 with the drawback being that you know not everyone loves bananas ?
 op asks a question and then argues all the answers .
 i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m misunderstanding ,  but why would i have to read the book if i &apos;ve already absorbed the knowledge instantly from touching it ?
 well that’s not really instantly absorbing it then it’s just reading the book just time is freezes while you are
 um yeah ,  no negative to this at all .
 time control and infinite knowledge .
 i &apos;m guessing part of the curse is that if you &apos;re just moving books around or if you accidentally touch the wrong book getting the right book out of the bookshelf that you have to read both .
 it &apos;s a bit dicey ,  but also having control over time would be pretty sweet .
 do you age while time is stopped ?
 do you need food and drink and poo breaks like normal ?
 if i read a book ,  finish it ,  time starts up ,  i set it down for a moment to flush my full toilet ,  and come back to put the book away does time stop and i have to start all over again ?
 i gain knowledge .
 i have time to read all the books i want ?
 where &apos;s the tradeoff ?
 no one is asking the real questions .
 if i decide to read a novel while frozen in time ,  and i skip a line by accident ,  do i have to play waldo to find it again because theoretically i wouldn’t have read the entire book cover to cover ?
 can i put the book down and do other things while time is frozen ?
 because i would do a lot with that
 sure ,  as long as i actually integrate and understand the book .
 i’ll just listen to fiction on audio books .
 not a curse but a blessing so yes .
 that would be amazing .
 is there any upper limit on the  &apos;amount &apos; on knowledge i could gain through this power ?
 if not then that just makes it better
 my friends would think i was irrationally afraid of books .
 hanging out having a good time ,  perhaps drunk .
 “hey check out this book .
 stuck for the next 20 hours reading a damn book when i just wanted some chicken wings .
 this is another example of the type of question i’d like to ban from askreddit
 it would totally ruin browsing at the book store .
 would also be very nervous walking near unstable book shelves and/or libraries .
 so if you are forced/ required to read the book cover to cover before the world starts turning again anyways ,  what the fuck is the point of instantly learning about the book ?
 now you &apos;re just forced to read a book but the whole story has already been spoiled for you .
 this sounds very dumb .
 so basically i get more time to read ,  retain more information from each book ,  and can control time .
 this would be awesome !
 i’d be able to just keep a book in my pocket that’s short and each time i want to pause time i can just touch the book .
 what if you fall down an open manhole or have a heart attack and die while time is frozen ,  thus leaving the book in a state of being perpetually unread ?
 let &apos;s say you only speak/read english .
 you touch an ancient chinese manuscript that even modern literates can &apos;t read .
 how do you learn the language ?
 does it count if you just look at all the characters ?
 you could die before finishing it ,  and you &apos;d be lonely ,  frustrated ,  and bored until then .
 this post is over a week old .
 to address some repeating comments: .
 i &apos;ve already explained how you could (not would) still die .
 time doesn &apos;t stop for you ,  or else you wouldn &apos;t be able to read ,  meaning you age and need to eat/drink as well ,  and if time is stopped for everything but you ,  can you still eat things operating at  &apos;absolute zero &apos; on an atomic level ?
 how does time work for everything ,  including you ,  in this situation ?
 i &apos;ve already explained how the  &apos;ancient chinese manuscript &apos; was an extreme example .
 the same situation applies to anyone who can &apos;t read anything ,  people who can &apos;t read other languages (or even written word) ,  and people slow to learn .
 what does it mean to  &apos;read &apos; ?
 what if you physically ,  educationally ,  or developmentally can &apos;t ?
 hopefully this curbs the  &apos;but you wouldn &apos;t die/ ancient manuscripts is bull &apos; comments .
 i was hoping for more conversation on the  &apos;monkey &apos;s paw &apos;/ grey area aspects .
 that &apos;s what makes these posts fun !
 edit 2: this is what i responded to: .
 so i can move freely when time is frozen ?
 or am i stuck there reading ?
 cuz if it &apos;s the former what &apos;s the problem ?
 if the latter i can learn a lot of skills easily .
 or freeze time by touching clifford and having a nap .
 we &apos;re both looking forward to conversation ,  not just shooting down a premise .
 the downside is if you lose the book or something is preventing you from finishing it .
 you &apos;re kinda screwed unless the abilities allows copies of that book to count .
 imagine if you drop the book into a pile of identical copies and the ability does not count reading the copies .
 or even worse ,  the pages vaporize when you turn them .
 “hey a light on the dashboard just turned on ,  can you flip open the manual and see what it means ?
 like 99% of the time .
 “oh god ,  is that one in mandarin ?
 it &apos;s  &apos;instant absorption &apos; of the knowledge ,  so to other people it seems like you didn &apos;t age or anything .
 depending on how you interpret the scenario you may not need to understand/learn anything ,  you just need to look at each line .
 seems like instead of  &apos;instantly gaining the knowledge &apos; you can  &apos;gain the knowledge &apos; by literally needing to read the book cover to cover .
 nothing says you also need to understand or learn anything from it .
 its all fun and games until you accidentally touch an encyclopedia
 not to mention the ability to sleep anytime you want .
 if your feeling sleepy just open a book ,  sleep and then finish it when you wake up .
 the smartest thing to do in this scenario would be skimming .
 not to mention if you are ever running late just keep a pile of kids books around e .
 car ,  backpack ,  work locker .
 car you open the book get in the car and you basically beat all traffic as long as you don &apos;t hit a situation where even the all the lanes are blocked which in my case would be unlikely ,  sure i might have to drive on the wrong side of the road at lights that were red to get around cars blocking the lane but it &apos;s all good .
 it would mean if i wanted to go something but had to work the same night as long as i had 5mins before my shift i could be 2h away and still make it .
 not to mention i could fuck with people i don &apos;t like e .
 break into people &apos;s homes and wash all their underwear and socks before they have to start work ,  move their car keys and tv remotes and scoop up there cats litter for like a week so they think it isn &apos;t pooping then take a giant human shit in it
 as long as my only pair of glasses doesn &apos;t break .
 just bring children’s books in sealed bags and whenever you want to freeze time you just touch one .
 don &apos;t accidentally touch a phone book
 accidentally touches war and peace
 thanks for that power .
 maybe the only downside i can think of is picking up something really dry/boring and starting to miss people before you &apos;re even done with it .
 you could be wandering a nighttime winter world for months ,  thinking  &apos;gosh ,  i miss my friends .
 but anna karenina is just not doing it for me today .
 i wonder what would happen if you accidentally tried to use the power on a book in a language you couldn &apos;t read .
 would you be stuck frozen in time until you learned traditional chinese or whatever and managed to read the entire book ?
 imagine a shelf full of bibles falling on you .
 until a library shelf collapses on you ,  and you try to dig yourself out one agonizing moment at a time .
 upside: become the world &apos;s most knowledgeable theologian before age 30 .
 downside: develop a deep-seated fear of church
 my thoughts exactly .
 do i need to sleep ?
 can i still consume food ?
 is there some leeway in different definitions of  &apos;book &apos; here ?
 could you get away with just reading the book of genesis ?
 at least that &apos;s a story .
 imagine it &apos;s the phone book or something .
 you ever try to read the bible cover to cover ?
 it &apos;s fucking awful .
 i couldn &apos;t make it past like the third chapter ,  and this was back when i still kinda believed in the christian god
 wait is the cover to cover average reading time of the bible actually only 50 hours or did you just make that up ?
 nothing in the prompt about your own time / aging freezing .
 your glasses break in the middle of reading a book .
 i am technically immortal as long as i read .
 in a frozen world ,  so no benefits .
 it &apos;s actually a curse lol
 hell ,  just grab a book on speed-reading and become a master of that and you &apos;ll get through any book in no time .
 like you say ,  reading itself is quick ,  it &apos;s processing the information that takes time .
 it &apos;s probably not as a penalty .
 from the wording of the post it says that the stopping time to read it is how it works ,  not as an extra feature .
 so to everyone else it seems like you have instantly learned ,  but in reality you have stopped time to learn it yourself and it only seems instant to those who were frozen .
 that &apos;s not a book ,  it &apos;s a device to access books .
  &apos;time to read all the books in existence !
 you could always have a child book ,  the kind of stuff who take 5 minutes to read and use your power in an handy way
 it doesn &apos;t say if it &apos;s voluntary .
 so if you touch a long book you don &apos;t want to read that could be very annoying .
 it also implies you have to finish every book you start which could also be annoying if you start one and realize it sucks .
 if you touch a book in a language with an alphabet you can &apos;t read i &apos;m not sure if you ever get out .
 if my smartphone counts as every book it can access then i &apos;m trapped forever .
 if you keep aging ,  that would be a downside .
 all those hours that time freezes for others .
 it would add up over a lifetime .
 that was what i was thinking .
 surely you’re not absorbing anything if you have to read the book anyway .
 the question was poorly written .
 “you’re offered to freeze time when you read a book and only unfreezes when you’re done absorbing it’s knowledge ,  do you accept this power/curse” .
 i’ll never understand how posts get upvoted here ,  honestly .
 why did i have to scroll so far to find this comment .
 i was so confused .
 like how is that an ability ?
 thats how reading works .
 my assumption was you read it and upon finishing you have all the knowledge effectively logged in a usable for in your mind .
 how many times have you read something from a text book and not remembered it for a test .
 that’s a hard choice bro ,  i dunno .
 would you take a shit for 16 quintillion dollars ?
 like ,  a fresh banana ,  or one of those that &apos;s been in your desk drawer since friday and has started going a bit brown ?
 i have to think that op meant something different from what everyone is interpreting this as ,  because otherwise this thread makes no sense .
 i think they must &apos;ve meant that ,  once you start reading a book ,  that is the only thing that you do until you are done .
 no repositioning your body .
 no glancing around the room .
 certainly no taking a break and napping .
 your eyes scan and your fingers turn pages--no free will about it .
 then there &apos;s at least something to think about .
 but they really didn &apos;t communicate that if that &apos;s what they meant .
 yeah i don &apos;t see how  &apos;instantly &apos; is part of this at all .
 if i handed you ,  say ,  a graduate-level textbook on nuclear fission ,  chances are you would not understand it by reading it .
  (unless you happen to have the background knowledge necessary .
 )  the ability offered is that you would fully absorb the knowledge of \any\ book .
 repeatedly throws bibles at you
 would the toilet flush if time was frozen ?
 you only  &apos;instantly &apos; know what &apos;s in the book from other people &apos;s perspective .
 you still have to read the entire book yourself .
 it wouldn &apos;t be spoiled for you .
 they never said you had to comprehend the information inside the book ,  just read it
 they did say that you absorb all info in the book ,  so theoretically you should also know how to read the book if you absorbed all the info inside of it .
 if time stops ,  do you stop aging .
 lol you could not touch a dictionary or encyclopedia without having to read the entire thing
 wouldn &apos;t it just hover wherever you let go of it ?
  &apos;no sharon ,  i &apos;ll just google it like a normal person &apos;
 while not ideal ,  at least there &apos;s some benefit to that and you wouldn &apos;t have to do it again for that vehicle .
 now you have perfect working knowledge of basically everything in the vehicle .
  &apos;i know honda civic-fu .
 that might be a boring read ,  but car manuals aren &apos;t as long as they look .
 it &apos;s surprisingly a lot of pictures and most things that aren &apos;t easy fixes the book will just tell you to take the car to a professional .
 other people don’t enjoy this ?
 car manuals are a surprisingly fast read since they &apos;re mostly images
 yeah that &apos;s what i was thinking ,  if by chance you touch a book in that 1% or a book falls and hits your ankle between your pants leg and sock or some shit then ohh well get reading try make sure it doesn &apos;t happen again
  &apos;uh ,  yeah ,  i told you i &apos;m studying abroad next semester .
 why are you being so weird about this ,  i just need to tie my shoe ?
 ay it said you had to read it not understand it
 this is exactly why i’d say no .
 this is a fucking genies wish waiting to happen
 heads up: mandarin is a dialect ,  not a written language !
 it &apos;s all written in chinese :)
 so here is the caveat ,  it’s instant absorption of the information in the book ,  right ?
 if it’s in another language ,  and not a book about learning that language itself ,  wouldn’t you need to scour to find books on learning that specific language ,  touch them ,  then read them cover to cover ,  in order to be able to come back to the original book to read it cover to cover ?
 how long would that take ?
 especially if time is frozen .
 you can’t drive or ride a bike to somewhere that might have the books you’re looking for .
 you could only walk ,  right ?
 i’m certain that i’m overthinking this ,  but i feel like this could get very convoluted ,  very quickly .
 it &apos;s all fun and games until you need to rearrange your library .
 i get it ,  guys ,  gloves .
 you can stop telling me that .
 since it &apos;s phrased as an ability ,  accidental contact doesn &apos;t really sound like a thing that would screw you up .
 i have the ability to run fairly quickly .
 this does not mean that every time i move ,  it has to be at my maximum running speed .
 i have the ability to ability to lift a 50lb weight .
 i am not compelled to lift a 50lb weight every time i see one .
 i have the ability to drive any modern car - that does not mean i will break into yours and drive it away .
 i have the ability to freeze time by reading a book .
 if i don &apos;t want to read that book ,  i wouldn &apos;t use my ability on it .
 i &apos;m fine with being stuck in time once you choose to use your power ,  but incidental contact just seems to obvious for anyone to risk accepting that curse .
 or a book in a different language
 keep an emergency backlog of childrens books for quick escapes .
 i love how this is the first thing i thought of as well
 i actually thought time freezing would entail that you won’t get hungry ,  won’t get tired ,  won’t have to pee etc .
 basically everything stops except your ability to read the book you touched .
 “that &apos;s not fair .
 that &apos;s not fair at all !
 hey ,  a twilight zone reference .
 this was one of my favorite episodes in the series lol .
 he was a serious reader ,  but only had one pair of glasses ?
  obviously wasn &apos;t a boy scout .
 easy solution ,  put glasses front of your eyes but don &apos;t let them touch you .
 they won &apos;t fall down since time is stopped as long as you don &apos;t touch them
 depends on how strict a definition of reading we &apos;re talking about .
 blankly staring at each page for a few seconds might be enough
 now you have time to learn braille .
 find the simplest and most familiar text you know in braille and work it out .
 if i could find the harry potter series between rowling &apos;s name and the various book titles i &apos;d have 23/26 letters in the alphabet on the cover .
 as soon as i hit the first chapter title i hit 24 ,  and the first 5 words of the first book 25/26 .
 q is the odd letter out but between quiet ,  quite ,  quierrel and quidditch i am confident i could figure it out .
 the real question is ,  am i fucking aging in here or what ?
 i have had a long time to think about that episode and what i would do .
 that &apos;s my exact thought .
 get an easy book to read .
 oh i need 5 extra hours of sleep ?
 cool ,  i &apos;ll read a 10 page children &apos;s book .
 when i feel like it .
 ok ,  side effect of this power is a much much stronger power than the main power .
  just bring any pocket size book(s) along anywhere you go and touch it ,  win at gambling ,  grab money from anywhere .
 whatever you can think of .
 just always have a little booklet with you so whenever you are in some argument ,  you can tap your time freeze book to collect your thoughts and come off like some super fast witted intellectual .
 you can think of your responses while you read .
 dangerous though ,  imagine you touch a book with a page torn out .
 you could spend eternity alone ,  searching for that page .
 few people saying that pages don’t need to be present ,  it’s just the ones between the cover .
 so can you just rip out all the pages to unfreeze time then ?
 this ,  so much possibility to abuse this with nearly no downside .
 just carry a stack of short books with you to freeze time at will .
 only downside is if it &apos;s forced ,  and now you can never read your kids a bedtime story .
 possible loophole: memorize it and have a fake book prop .
 freeze time with extra steps ?
 to an outside observer that just looks like the ability to freeze time .
 sign me up as long as i don &apos;t age while frozen
 the downside for me is that i can no longer read to pass the time .
 because reading literally passes no time anymore
 have someone break books down into individual chapter readers and you could freeze and unfreeze time at will .
 i feel like if i was that bored i &apos;d just finish the damn book .
 there &apos;s no way to learn chinese from just looking at it .
 traditional or simplified (which are mostly the same ,  the latter just has a slightly lower amount of strokes for easier writing .
 hell ,  half the time you can recognize the other character if you know one of the variants) .
 it says read ,  not understand .
 you could even read a book in a language you know and not really understand it .
 (or if there &apos;s one word you don &apos;t know - would that count as  &apos;not reading &apos; ?
 ) i think you could definitely outlawyer the universe with this one ,  by simply examining every character/word .
 imagine trying to figure out which one touched you first ,  reading like 6 bibles and time not unfreezing ,  wondering if it’s another bible or if you accidentally missed a page in one of the 6 you think you’ve read .
 imagine swearing on the bible in court
 i believe that you if have allready absorbed all the informations from one book you won &apos;t have to absorb it (and freeze time with it) again
 wouldn &apos;t time freeze as soon as one touched you ,  allowing you to escape ?
 it doesnt take thaat long to read a book .
 and you actually learn stuff while doing it .
 i have a pretty hard time to imagine a book shelf which is sooo boring that i would have a huge problem with it .
 with reading lets say ten hours a day you are also getting really good at reading and faster .
 i love the idea that all you need to do to become the world &apos;s most knowledgeable theologian is read the bible a bunch of times
 i would think you would still have to do all normal humanly things .
 because you aren &apos;t stopped ,  it &apos;s not like your body goes on pause but you &apos;re still active .
 then that would imply your body breaks down faster in  &apos;real time ,  &apos; since your body is continue to work .
 so you could essentially age 10/20/30 etc years in a few hours of  &apos;real &apos; time if you touch enough books
 some people in this thread seem to imagine that time being stuck means literally everything but you and that books are stuck in place .
 like if a pile of books fell on you ,  you would be stuck under the books until you had read them all .
 i was thinking more like nothing moves on its own but you could still move stuff if you wanted .
 in which case you’d probably carrying around a one page book with you to abuse the power .
 it says cover to cover
 i tried it once and got to a bit where it was just a list of names ,  like who was the son of who and whatever .
 why is that even in there ?
 not a good read .
 there &apos;s some great poetry and adventures stories in there .
 lamentations and job offer interesting psychological insights .
 there &apos;s no rule about reading everything in a particular book (i &apos;ve skipped portions of moby dick and the league of extraordinary gentlemen ,  vol .
 iii ,  for instance) .
 part of it might be the particular translation ,  too .
 there &apos;s a reason people often like to read shakespeare ,  beowulf ,  or chaucer in a modern translation .
 (also ,  in the cases of beowulf and chaucer ,  there aren &apos;t many readers of old english and middle english around these days .
 i had to read it cover-to-cover for a required theology class at the christian uni i attended to appease my fundamentalist parents .
 we covered it in exceptional detail and my professor was a true expert (he translated several books of the nlt as well as several exotic translations) .
 the experience made it really clear just how different the priorities of most christians are from the lessons in scripture .
 and how many sermons i &apos;d listened to growing up were taking a microscopic piece of a story and filling the details in with opinions .
 in fact ,  it was ultimately the dissonance between what i read and what i &apos;d seen and experienced in the church that led me to renounce my faith .
 elements of socialism and acceptance of refugees and minorities are among the biggest discrepancies ,  but clearly the biggest of all is the superseding command to simply love other people instead of following the  &apos;letter of the law &apos; .
 preaching redemption and forgiveness ,  not fire ,  brimstone ,  and condemnation .
 ps  the historical context provided by my professor changed a lot of my perspective .
 for example ,  pederasty versus homosexuality .
 if my hypothetical kid wanted to apprentice with a greasy old welder and he said ,   &apos;sure ,  in exchange for his butthole &apos; i don &apos;t think anyone would say ,   &apos;that &apos;s a deal for me !
 comparing that situation to adam and steve or julie and eve next door who by the way have a remarkably low likelihood of divorce ,  is just apples and oranges .
 eh ,  it &apos;s not that bad .
 parts of the old testament are pretty dry ,  that &apos;s true .
 but i read the bible like 5x over 6 years and it was fine .
 lots of fun references ,  and entertaining stories .
 it &apos;s just intermixed with a lot of annoying genealogies and law codes .
 at some point i wouldn &apos;t mind writing an abridged version aimed at secular audiences that doesn &apos;t suck .
 if you still age ,  then there &apos;s barely any pros to this ability .
 all it &apos;s doing is forcing you to binge read everything you touch .
 the world is frozen ,  so you have to assume that it comes with immortality and no need for eating and sleeping .
  otherwise it doesn &apos;t give you the power to instantly learn books from the perspective of other people .
 it just makes you die the moment you touch an encyclopedia for the first time .
 i think it’s required that your own time can’t freeze; otherwise ,  you couldn’t read the book to return time to normal .
 you’d effectively be perpetually stuck in frozen time if you ever touch a book otherwise .
 that said ,  i think your other point demonstrates something more ambiguous about this prompt .
 if your own personal time remains unfrozen while the rest of time is frozen ,  do you age ?
 because if so ,  this is the opposite of immortality: you could read a book ,  spent 40 years in frozen time ,  and instantly appear 40 years older to anyone observing you (as their time would have been frozen while you aged) .
 when i read this ,  i interpreted it similarly to the person you responded to: that time overall would freeze ,  aside from my own personal time—and that i wouldn’t age while that time was frozen .
 but now i see that there is another way that prompt could be interpreted .
 the reading/length of the book is not what takes time when trying to absorb/understand concepts in math and physics books - it &apos;s common to breeze through a chapter only to spend hours on a page trying to take in a certain theorem proof or the like .
 i &apos;m still trying to understand if the prompt means you instantly get it ,  but then have to read it ,  or if it says time freezes until you read and absorb everything in a text .
  either way ,  sign me up !
  i &apos;d love taking a few solo weeks/months to work through a topology book or the like .
 idk if wifi will run ,  so only those you have downloaded and haven &apos;t read .
 let &apos;s hope people here don &apos;t build their kindle libraries like they do their steam libraries .
 your friends ,  why do you have so many curious george and clifford books you dont even have kids ?
 fuck it fold a sticky note in half and call it a book
 just keep a board book in your purse or backpack all the time .
 instant time stopping abilities .
 if the mechanical act of looking at the words means you gain the information in the book then it is an amazing gift .
 if you are required to learn and retain 100% of the information in order to unfreeze time then it &apos;s definitely a curse .
 even more so if you need to understand what that info means .
 maybe you could memorize the contents of a short book written in a language you don &apos;t speak ,  but if understanding is required then i hope that you are prepared to learn a new language from books alone .
 now is better to understand .
 so hard to make that call .
 in the one hand it &apos;s a little bit of money and we can all use for those little things we need around the house .
 on the other hand ,  i would be totally mortified if someone found out and said something like  &apos;you know ,  bananas are okay but they &apos;re just not my thing .
  &apos; or worse yet ,  comment on the little black nub at the bottom i would have to eat .
 can you imagine ?
 only if no one ever knew about it and the toilet washed me after .
 can you imagine how embarrassing it would be for other people to know you had a bowel movement at some point in the past ?
 oh obviously a pristine one .
 what kind of monster would ask someone to eat a banana that has some spots on it ?
 other parts of the banana you won &apos;t have to eat are the little strings under the peel and the brown nub at the bottom sometimes referred to as  &apos;satan &apos;s asshole &apos; .
 this is a serious question and i wouldn &apos;t want to include too many negative aspects to it and unbalance the delicate equation .
 this is correct because otherwise there would be no downside to make it a curse .
 for the outside world its instantly ,  i guess
 thank you ,  i thought i was the only one who was so confused om the  &apos;instantly &apos; part .
 how is it  &apos;instantly &apos; absorbing knowledge if you have to read it cover to cover anyway ?
 well you can’t throw a bible if you’re frozen in time .
 quickly throw the encyclopedias !
 satan: i gotta say ,  i &apos;m a huge fan
  society isn &apos;t destroyed .
  i go to the pharmacy and grab a pair of readers .
 read the book and then buy them on the way out .
 only if you wear glasses ,  and it’s not like glasses as a whole stop existing when time freezes .
 true ,  if thats so ,  its op ,  since i absorbed the knowledge ,  that means i must have gained an understanding of the language as well
 you have to comprehend it in order to  &apos;read &apos; it .
 otherwise you &apos;re just staring at artwork
 technically encyclopedias are volumes of books so worst case you have to read about every damn thing that starts with d .
 yeah ,  and i don’t think anything would be “preventing” me from reading or finding it after it gets misplaced seeing as the entire universe is literally waiting on me to read it
 i love the idea of floating books ,  time standing still ,  all obligations hovering ,  until i devour it cover-to-cover !
 yes ,  sign me up !
 now you need to read the entire internet
 user manual is not the same as a service manual .
 but the point stands - at least you &apos;ll know every light and button in the car
 “well ,  i have to go i have a standing up appointment .
 let me get my book insulating gloves
 answers in perfect mandarin
 do you know how to read mandarin ?
 and once you read it ,  you will understand it .
 but that also makes me ask ,  when its in moon runes and you don &apos;t know the pronunciation ,  how does that work ?
 don &apos;t ever touch the voynich manuscript
 monkey paw wishes
 i guess the instant absorption works by freezing time ,  looking at the book page to page until you &apos;ve read it and then the time unfreezes after you &apos;ve soaked everything in and while all this happens you don &apos;t age for some reason .
 is that what you were saying ?
 sorry english is my second language .
 imagine accidentally touching a book that is written in or even has a photo of a recognizable portion of an ancient ,  dead ,  and inconveniently exotic language that has only been partially translated ,  if at all .
 you actually may have to learn to sail/pilot a ship in order to break into places around the world in order to get the required learning materials to actually absorb the knowledge of the language if any is technically able to be imparted; this is even harder since literally nobody can teach you ,  or if the name of the language isn’t cited in or near the photo and you don’t recognize it and don’t even know where to start .
 fucking little toddler book with a derpy stock image of some shit in a museum got you on an impossible quest .
 still a fair trade off to a pretty sweet power .
 if a language is truly dead and lost to the ages ,  impossible to translate; would the universe give you a pass or would it come to a halt ?
 assuming that it only works once per book ,  you &apos;d get the chance to read all the books in your collection that you &apos;ve bought but never read .
 i &apos;d say it gets tough if you &apos;re a librarian because you have to read books that other people chose to read .
 oh shit i have 200 upvotes
 the gloves would be something mysterious about you as well like people know something is up with you but they’re not sure what and can’t prove anything
 be like abe sapien from hellboy ,  take off your gloves in some theatrical way and lay your had upon the book like your mentally fucking it for some reason then pick your head up all wise and dispel the knowledge of the gods .
 like in saiki k ?
 conceal don’t feel
 if op was a malicious entity looking to  &apos;monkey paw &apos; us then yeah ,  there are a lot of ways he could fuck us over with that description but since i haven &apos;t found op going more into detail about the ability and there is no malicious undertones ,  as it stands ,  the ability should not become a negative .
 the  &apos;negative &apos; or the  &apos;trade off &apos; of the prompt is already there: reading the whole book cover to cover .
 that &apos;s the thing op is wondering if we are willing to do for the ability to gain knowledge which btw i &apos;m pretty sure was the main draw of the prompt ,  not the time freeze which everyone else seems to have jumped for lol .
 myself included ,  i &apos;d want this power for the time freeze .
 could you reread it or will you run out of short books ?
 unless there is some internet source to generate random stories (counts as a  &apos;book &apos;) then you touch it and boom .
 i can still read the large print books !
 oh god ,  that one made me genuinely sad for him
 we used to watch the twilight zone all the time at school and this is the only episode i remember lol
 or could just go to a glasses shop ?
 surely they’re not all broken .
 or ,  take advantage of time being frozen and go somewhere like a mall where there &apos;s lots of people and try other people &apos;s glasses until you find a pair that &apos;s close enough to your prescription .
 or maybe you need to essentially study and memorize all details of the book .
 that would be a monkey’s paw to this .
 imagine having to memorize and internalize all aspects of harry potter in order to unfreeze time ,  including all of the character interactions and how they affect other characters and storylines ,  maybe even understanding all literary devices that are supposed to enhance the narrative .
 accidentally touches where &apos;s waldo .
 time stuck forever .
 to be fair it is much harder to gamble with the way the power works .
 you look mad sus from other people &apos;s perspective .
 you &apos;re at the blackjack table and between every hand you &apos;re picking up a new children &apos;s book for one an instance then putting it right back down .
 that would not fly at a casino and they would most definitely think you &apos;re cheating lol .
 i wonder if books are reusable .
 if the power is to  &apos;absorb the knowledge of the book by reading it &apos; ,  then that book is used up after you finished reading it .
 you don &apos;t even have to start reading right away .
 can just touch the booklet to freeze time then spend eternity researching for a valid argument .
 come back finishing the booklet and completely destroy your opponents .
 that sounds like a good twilight zone episode to me .
 that &apos;s not fair at all !
 there was time now &apos;
 reading the book cover to cover .
 it doesn &apos;t say all the pages have to be present .
 only wins in this scenario .
 unless a cover is missing .
 it &apos;s just cover to cover so i assume you only have to read what is physically between the two covers .
 i think the real issue would be touching a book in a foreign language .
 does it have to be that same book ?
 or can it be different copy ?
 you would not need to find the page .
  the power is about absorbing all the knowing in that book ,  not about absorbing knowledge that was on that book .
  otherwise the first book which was edited would get you stuck forever .
 you could always listen to audiobooks to pass the time !
 you could just read the book without touching it .
 the power says you know the book when you touch it ,  but does not forbid you from reading it .
 you could self publish each page as it &apos;s own book
 yeah ,  i suppose that would depend on whether or not you &apos;re allowed to do other things while time is frozen (like finding and reading language learning materials) .
 if you &apos;re stuck not being able to do anything at all but stare at the book ,  you &apos;d be pretty screwed with some languages .
 could maybe puzzle things out eventually if the language is related to one you know (e .
 if you speak italian and the book is in another romance language like spanish or french) ,  but with a difference as significant as that between english and chinese i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s any way you could figure it out even with effectively infinite time .
 which raises the question ,  would you still absorb the knowledge ?
 if you read a chinese book about physics ,  would you know about physics ?
 if not ,  is that purely because you don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re reading ?
 and if that was the case ,  what about if you read a book in your native language about physics but just don &apos;t understand the concepts ?
 would you fail to absorb that too ?
 subject matter beyond one &apos;s understanding may as well be a different language - it &apos;s the same end result .
 if so ,  this power grants you the ability to learn things you &apos;re already capable of learning .
 i think i &apos;ll stick to the slower way of doing things .
 it &apos;ll take me longer and cost me my edge over some people ,  but at least i won &apos;t get frozen for hours to days several times a week .
 but theoretically you &apos;d have an infinite amount of time because time froze .
 so wouldn &apos;t you be forced to finish reading it ?
 could you pick up another book and read it while time was frozen ?
 would your body continue to age when time was frozen ?
 would you live forever if you never finished the book ?
 so many questions ,  so little time .
 would you need to know what the characters sound like for it to count as  &apos;reading &apos; it ?
  ,  i know roughly what capire must sound like ,  even if i &apos;d have no idea what it meant if i hadn &apos;t just googled it to find an example (italian for  &apos;to understand &apos;) .
 i wouldn &apos;t have even the slightest clue how  would sound ,  though .
 they would all freeze in the air ,  only the first would touch you .
 plus ,  they would only need to be skimmed after the first time .
 calm down satan jesus
 imagen it being the first one you read ,  but some pages stuck together .
 but like if all the bibles fall on you the one that touched you first will probably fall down since time shouldnt affect it .
 meanwhile all the others will be midair .
 there are a lot of different versions of the bible
 imagine reading an eight hundred page medical encyclopedia from 1916 .
 that sounds so incredibly boring and time consuming .
 i mean you &apos;d spend hundreds of hours forced to read non stop to get unstuck .
 nobody had ever made it all the way through before !
 it &apos;s a bit sad how much truth there is in this .
 way too many people claiming deep religious knowledge and conviction haven &apos;t even read the book they claim to know the doctrine of so well .
 read it once and you &apos;ll be further along in bible knowledge than most .
 i think it would be a little more magical than that .
 like you wouldn &apos;t noticeably age and your cells wouldn &apos;t deteriorate during that time ,  not getting hungry or thirsty but you may depending on your reading speed and comprehension skill need to sleep from time to time .
 but then ,  what &apos;s the point of the power ?
 there &apos;s nothing stopping me from deciding to read every book i touch already .
 so if i read the front cover ,  turn it counter clockwise ,  read the spine ,  then the back - does that count ?
 honestly this reminds me of why i never finished the silmarillion .
 the  &apos;begats &apos; aren &apos;t page-turners ,  for sure .
 it &apos;s at the beginning of matthew and mark ,  the purpose is to show that jesus was a descendant of david ,  which fulfilled old testament prophecy about the coming messiah .
 lmao i got stuck at that exact section
 a lot of people get stuck on the book of numbers .
 this books primary purpose was to record the numbers of the jewish population at the time ,  and also helps trace the lineage of jesus .
 it’s there for reference ,  but i totally skipped it when i did my read through of the book
 i came to the same conclusion when i read it cover to cover .
 (technically listened to it) i realized that the sermons being told most of the time were half the story .
 then they would explain what that portion ment .
 but if you read the whole thing it may not mean that at all .
 i am glad i listened to it as it changed my entire perspective on what being a catholic means .
 plus ,  lets be honest ,  in the bible ,  gods mostly an asshole .
 i did enjoy the book of job though .
 i presume that you would be free to do things other than to read the book .
 you could for example ,  rob a bank frozen in time ,  then sit down on a giant pile of cash and read the book to restart time .
 i think the pro would be the instant comprehension ,  which i would definitely trade a few years off my life for .
 however ,  you would develop a fear for large books i would imagine .
 not only not age ,  but also not need to eat or sleep or perform any other bodily functions .
 your body magically remains in stasis while you reading ,  even though you can still move .
 of course now we’ve introduced more variables .
 we’ve just created infinite energy .
 are you impervious to fall damage ?
 i understood it as the second you touch it ,  you understand & know everything in it ,  but still have to manually read the whole thing anyway .
 otherwise this is a far less annoying curse (but still very punishing unless you’re careful) .
 uh it &apos;s for the plot
 it’s for other people’s kids .
 i like to read books to strangers kids .
 and why are my pants constantly falling down when i come over ?
 depend how specific your power is about their definitions of a book .
 if i was your power i would say  &apos;a book have several page ,  stop messing with me &apos;
 i’m crying at the thought of it .
 no ,  i’d have to pass .
 it’s not that much money anyways ,  and sacrificing my self-worth and any respect anyone has for me just to receive some convenient pocket change isn’t worth it .
 i read that as  &apos;take a shirt &apos; and was like  &apos;why are they washing the shirt in a toilet ?
 i need to learn to read .
 ppl keep saying this .
 have you ever read a boring book ?
 have you ever struggled to read through a chemistry textbook ?
 the pros outweigh the cons but there is still clearly a downside .
 or even getting slightly creative with it ,  imagine some asshole pushes you into a bookshelf .
 even if you like reading no one would like being forced to read 200 books in one go .
 even if you  &apos;absorb the knowledge &apos; (whatever the fuck that means .
 can you forget it ?
 if so then thats just what reading is) maybe the books are shitty and don &apos;t have any useful info .
 or maybe they &apos;re encyclopedias from 100 years ago and you &apos;re absorbing incorrect knowledge .
 there is clearly a downside .
 shelf of books fall on you .
 touching a yellow pages book on accident .
 touhcing a book in a foreign language .
 i would probably feel the need to have nearly my whole body clothed (assuming if a book doesn &apos;t touch my skin ,  prevents the time pause) just so that i don &apos;t get random events in which i have to read a 1 , 000 page book i accidentally touched .
 i can see a lot of maddening situations ,  that can happen repetitively .
 i mean some of my absolute favorite times are when i settle down outside in my backyard or on the beach with a book and a mimosa while my husband reads/plays on his phone/naps next to me .
 it’s unbelievably peaceful and makes me feel totally contented with my life .
 wouldn’t really be able to do that because he’d be totally frozen ,  so we wouldn’t be passing the time together anymore .
 i love to read and for sure sometimes feel like i don’t have enough time to do so ,  but honestly with this power i don’t think it would feel like a hobby anymore ,  but instead more of a chore .
 so there is somewhat of a downside to it .
 we learned hieroglyphics but that did not mean we understood the language till the rosetta stone was uncovered .
 another example - we come across aliens who know the same math we do .
 unless both sides can agree on notation and meaning ,  the knowledge will not be of much use .
 i can read spanish out loud in a very convincing voice ,  all the while i have no idea what i’m saying .
 i gotta say it &apos;s been a decade or so since i touched an encyclopedia .
 get to know the d
 i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a book ,  honestly
 at least it would be very easy to get revenge .
 i am supposed to have a back ,  sack and crack &apos;
 just put a cover over it before picking it up ,  then you aren &apos;t technically touching it .
 just let me leaf through a learn mandarin book .
 if not ,  you will
 if did say that you learn the knowledge immediately .
 in fact this superpower would be an absolute dream .
 just start by reading language learning books .
 then practice on the actual literature in that language .
 you could reach literary fluency in many languages in about a day’s time .
 my take on it is more about touching a book that is in a language you are not familiar with .
 if i touched a book ,  for instance ,  written in japanese ,  a language i have zero frame of reference to understand ,  i would absorb the knowledge of the information in the book immediately .
 but ,  i would not then be able to read it since i can’t read japanese .
 so would time stay frozen until i could get my hands on several volumes of books teaching me japanese ,  all the way from novice to expert so that i could then go back and read the original book that i had touched ?
 to further this ,  what if i touched this original book in japanese out in a cabin in the middle of nowhere ?
 how could i go about obtaining books on teaching me that language so that i could read the original text ?
 this could conceivably take years of my life .
 your question drives me to another question ,  when one of these replies said ,   &apos;if we need to read another book to learn a language for the first book &apos; .
 would time freeze twice ?
 depends on when you got those books .
 if you got them after you got the power ,  then you would’ve already read them .
 what if this was a librarian curse
 so i wouldn &apos;t have a line of books taunting me ?
 what &apos;s the fun in that ?
 you could wear gloves !
 you still  &apos;wouldn &apos;t have time &apos; to read it
 from now on you don’t have to buy books ,  you read them in the bookstore !
 or how about touching a book ,  after touching a book and not finishing the read ?
 touch a book ,  then another one ,  and another one .
 imagine meeting this person who has a seemingly endless knowledge about different books ,  never stressed about not studying enough ,  and always insists on wearing gloves .
 instantly ,  that person goes from just regular old smart person to someone who definitely has some dramatic secret .
 instant cryptid material !
 this is actually really smart ,  keep it really small an dit keep it in your breast pocket or something so it can easily be touched in any situation .
 use the book to freeze time and you can do whatever you want ,  exams cheated ,  escape dangerous situations ,  fuck with people because i so der how energy would react  when you push objects in frozen time ,  would they not move and the accelerate at the appropriate speed once time unfroze or is it a situation where it adds huge amounts of energy and speed when unfrozen .
 if that &apos;s the case you could produce technically infinite energy by getting proper equipment and setting up a system where you can push a turbine to generate electricity ,  meaning you could be rich or never hav eto pay for electricity again .
 run out of time to clean the house before your parents get home ?
 quick ,  touch a book and time will freeze and let you clean .
 then just finish reading the book and bam .
 yeah ,  but they didn’t specify whether you stop aging in the process .
 so you could get really old really quick relative to those around you .
 freezing time would be cool .
 but having a shorter life might not be .
 imagine if it &apos;s a book with a thousand pages ,  font size 8 ,  in comic sans .
 obligatory  &apos;monkey &apos;s paw does not give you what you desire in some twisted or inconvenient form but rather gives you exactly as you desire but as a result of horrible occurrence like the death of a loved one resulting in you gaining their fortune &apos;
 by daughter has a set of these tiny (about 2in x 1in) books in a littl case .
 there &apos;s about 12 books in it ,  and it would fit in .
 probably a cargo pants pocket .
 just keep a fanny pack or purse full of those ad you &apos;re good .
 go on /r/slavelabour and hire people to make 100 haiku ebooks ,  print those suckers off and enjoy .
 there are a lot of childrens books out there
 it turns out it &apos;s man !
 where is that reference from ?
 that was part of the story .
  he had an unusual prescription and had to have glasses specially made .
 to give a real life example ,  i have standard reading glasses ,  but my wife has astigmatism (the lenses in her eyes are asymmetric) and needs to have her glasses made specially .
 the city was destroyed by a hydrogen bomb .
 or just keep a pair or two of backup glasses like me ,  because although i am not a smart man i am smart enough to be aware of the fact 
 what if it &apos;s got a missing page ?
 book doesn &apos;t need to be obvious and you could experiment with what counts as a  &apos;book &apos; .
  you could have it in a purse and have a hand always on your purse ,  drumming your fingers nervously ,  and every now and then your finger accidentally touches the book sticking out .
 if you &apos;re a gentleman ,  similar idea ,  you just need it to be subtle .
 morever ,  in a world where this kind of power isn &apos;t known to be possible ,  frankly even if they suspect you they won &apos;t have the slightest idea of how you are doing it .
 you &apos;re thinking way too small .
 sit inside your hotel room ,  completely in private .
 walk to the casino ,  steal all the cash they have ,  walk back to your hotel room ,  unfreeze time .
 no one will have seen you ,  no one will suspect you .
 they &apos;re welcome to examine the book .
 get a ton of childrens books at your disposal
 you &apos;d have to keep a bag of like ,  a few dozen little short stories .
 i’ll be able to retort with more than “no u”
 this is what ben shapiro thinks he does
 ohhh wait does that mean there is a nap loophole ?
 i could tap a book ,  take a long nap ,  then read by myself ,  and only then need to go back to real life .
 or that one scary door episode .
  &apos;cursed by his own hubris .
 i’ve had eye surgery and now can’t read without (at least) magnifying reader glasses .
  because of this episode i have them stashed everywhere .
 that episode seriously made me feel depressed for a few hours afterwards .
 that episode haunted me as a kid
 could be in a foreign alphabet .
 sure you could probably mouth your way through spanish or french ,  but mandarin ?
 you could be stuck picking up a mandarin to english dictionary and have to read it all through again everytime you forgot a character .
 i &apos;d carry a 1 page book around with me .
 i &apos;d get to pause time whenever i wanted .
 another scenario could be reading an unfinished book since now the book isnt complete and never will be due to the time frozen for author .
 it says  &apos;read &apos; ,  not  &apos;understand &apos; ;)
 but then i can &apos;t listen to music while i read !
 i &apos;m griping with the small stuff at this point ,  though
 how do you read a book without touching it ?
 keeping in mind that ,  generally ,  when i want to pass time i &apos;m in a boring situation ,  like a waiting room or public transport .
 i suppose gloves could just about work (if that &apos;s not a  &apos;loophole &apos; that gets ignored) ,  but separating pages while wearing gloves sounds like a nightmare
 ooh this opens an interesting question of what counts as a book .
 you could keep “the chronicles of the time freezing sticky-note (written on the time freezing sticky note)” in your pocket to freeze time whenever necessary
 but don’t you want to have new and interesting things to read each time you do it .
 i can only read hop on pop so many times .
 how accurately you can pronounce something is a sliding scale; without a defined cut off ,  you can always argue it back to the extreme case where you don &apos;t have any clue at all .
 anyway ,  most chinese speakers do not know all the chinese characters by a long way .
 they would surely be subject to the same rules ,  so if they didn &apos;t know a character they could make the opposite argument ( &apos;but in english .
  &apos;) to justify their own non-entrapment .
 no ,  because you can read and perfectly understand a book even if you don &apos;t know how any of the words are pronounced .
 deaf readers ,  for instance .
 why would they even need to be skimmed ?
 you already know the book .
 this is the answer
 yeah ,  i &apos;ve read the bible like five times ,  after a while ,  you mostly just remember most of the stories ,  and you just skim over the  &apos;begets &apos; .
 this guy fucksreezes time .
 what if they &apos;re all different editions of the bible ?
 imagine accidentally touching a book in another language .
 well i thought that the comment was implying they were all the same version
 yeah ,  but the message is still the same ,  with the exception of the extra books in catholic and mormon bibles .
 i don &apos;t think different syntax would make a difference ,  but who knows in this imaginary scenario haha
  &apos;there &apos;s a whole shelf of tax law books right here .
 that &apos;s true for a lot of the laity ,  but not of priests (who typically need a smattering of masters degrees)
 ironically ,  the bible is one of the most censored book in history ,  by the church itself .
 back in medieval times ,  someone who wasn’t a clergyman was not supposed to read the bible
 okay ,  that would be a lot better if you didn &apos;t actually age !
 your employer doesn &apos;t count lost productivity during stopped time .
 maybe ,  but do you wanna risk passing off the magic book gods ?
 i swear the silmarillion is just the lotr bible
 it happens multiple times .
 there’s also the genealogy in genesis of adam to noah .
 there are many more i’m pretty sure .
 which doesn &apos;t even make sense ,  as it details the lineage from david to joseph ,  who did not father jesus if the immaculate conception is to be believed .
  so the lineage is of jesus &apos;s step-dad who he shares no blood relation with
 well ,  it is called numbers .
 a lot of people get stuck on the book of numbers .
 this books primary purpose was to show the lineage of jesus .
 what version of numbers did you read ?
 it &apos;s part of the torah ,  which predates jesus and jewish people do not recognize jesus as being the messiah .
 just carry around a back pack full of children &apos;s books .
 that &apos;s probably the only way i &apos;d reread ulysses ,  haha .
 i read it the opposite way .
 as soon as you finish the last word on the last page ,  boom it clicks and you 100% have it down .
 now i wonder if i would get hungry while reading ?
 some books are hella long .
 big red dog &apos;s had a very nice day .
 fold it in 4ths and write a word on each page then .
 “this book is over” .
 how often does a book shelf fall on you ?
 how often do you touch random books on accident with anything but your hands ?
 hell ,  how often does a book touch you anywhere besides your hands ?
 are you headbutting books all the time ?
 unless you’re already walking around in nothing but your underwear and wrecking libraries there won’t be much of a difference between what you do now and just wearing a pair of gloves .
 i know ,  but we are thinking too realistically considering what the power does .
 it makes whatever we read our own knowledge ,  could be that we don &apos;t understand the language but know what the book contains in our own language .
 could be that we gain an understanding of the other language itself .
 to add to this ,  i’ve read books in english where i don’t understand things .
 you can  &apos;read &apos; spanish because it &apos;s still somewhat phonetic and shares latin roots with your mother tongue  .
 chinese would just be a bunch of uncomprehensible squiggly lines .
 you wouldn &apos;t be able to even begin pronouncing them like you could spanish or french ,  thus literally impossible to read by any definition of the word
 i dunno - can you say you read lips because you watch the shape that someone &apos;s mouth is making even if you have no idea what they were saying ?
 in your case you are comprehending something about the words too ,  with no knowledge of chinese characters you can &apos;t even get as far as speaking the words .
 also the op notes that the ability is to  &apos;absorb information instantly &apos; which you can &apos;t do if you don &apos;t understand or comprehend what you &apos;re looking at
 is time still frozen ?
 the stanley parable is just too good .
 i have to return some videotapes
 from an outside perspective that is how your ability works ,  the reality is you are forced to read the book in a locked timespace .
 i think he means that you absorb it as soon as you finish reading it but to any outsider it seems as knowing it instantly because they won’t know the time had stopped .
 so you yourself get more time to read but do have to read and any other person thinks you know immediately
 i would argue that the knowledge in a book contains the knowledge of that language as well .
 you cannot gain the knowledge of a book without knowing its language .
 if you read the english version of the japanese book you touched ,  it would not be able to contain the nuances that the original japense version held .
 you lose little bits of the original understanding in even the best translations .
 books inherently contain the knowledge of the language they &apos;re written in .
 if that &apos;s the case what about a tech manual ?
 what about a book like slaughterhouse 5 where you can read it but not necessarily understand the message ?
 what about philosophy books ?
 this would get very complicated if we didn &apos;t accept complete understanding to be flexible .
 yeah but you get to live forever while time is stopped .
 the only way that it works as explained in the title would mean that you don &apos;t age .
 otherwise the power would be about  &apos;instantly absorbing the knowledge into an instantly growing beard .
  &apos;  touch a long book at work at 8am ,  and suddenly i have a 5 o &apos;clock shadow .
 then i accidentally touch another book ,  and i have two days growth .
   so yeah ,  it would kind of suck to have to walk a few hundred miles to a place with enough japanese language material for you to learn japanese ,  but at least time is frozen .
 if i had the power ,  my first stop would be a library .
 when i was a child ,  and i first came to understand that i would one day die ,  what made me most sad was that i would never be able to read every great book ever written .
 and that i wouldn &apos;t even have enough time to read every great book written yet .
 i am not going to sleep the night through am i ?
 you &apos;re a smart one aren &apos;t you
 somebody write a book about this .
 you know ,  coming into this thread i was really on the fence about this ,  but you people have sold me
 just some eccentric michael jackson wannabe .
 sounds mysterious on paper but for most people that &apos;s just gonna end up being the weird smart kid with gloves .
 want to binge the latest netflix season time to read  &apos;hop on pop &apos;
 print up a few dozen  &apos;books &apos; that only consist of a few words .
 carry some in your pockets at all times ,  and then be able to freeze time on demand .
 presumably for  &apos;balance &apos; reasons the world is frozen except for the book .
  uh ,  is your body &apos;s aging also frozen ?
  because that would be super bad if it weren &apos;t as to use this ability properly you would want to read for centuries .
 ah i get to achive my life &apos;s ambition of becoming an old hag
 can you still interact with things in the frozen time ?
 like go get food and water ?
 what happens if there &apos;s some sort of medical emergency that happens while time is stopped ?
 time probably doesn &apos;t resume so does your corpse suddenly teleport to wherever you died ?
 do you teleport every time you finish reading unless you finish the book in the exact same spot ?
 good thing i can read braille
 the twilight zone .
 but she wouldn’t be incapable of reading entirely if she used a prescription at least close to it .
 my so wears glasses and like all glasses wearers ,  has her rx updated every so often as she ages .
 she has several pairs of old glasses laying around and even if they aren &apos;t her current  &apos;correct &apos; rx ,  they are more than good enough to see with .
 who are all these people who never keep an old/backup pair of glasses ?
 thats like only owning one pair of shoes (by choice) .
  &apos;cover to cover &apos; do it wouldn &apos;t matter .
 i &apos;m pretty sure you could hack the system by ripping out all the pages actually .
 what counts as a  &apos;book &apos; .
 this was my first thought .
 how do you define  &apos;book &apos; are flyers and pamphlets books ?
 what about catalogs and magazines ?
 if those count do you have to literally read every catalog line ,  every ad ,  etc .
 what about essays ?
 what about e-books ?
 i read so many e-books .
 i &apos;d love more time to read ,  but i dont think ebooks would count so i &apos;d have to start reading paper books only .
 casinos won &apos;t care how you &apos;re doing it .
 if you acting weird leads them to even suspect you &apos;re cheating ,  they &apos;re gonna chuck you out
 they can also just kick you out without having to give a reason .
 board books galore .
  need a break ,  touch a baby book with like 3 words in it .
  enjoy the solitude ,  take a nap ,  catch your breath then read the book .
 become a publisher of short books of haikus .
 yea just keep gloves on all the time so you dont touch war and peace
 honestly you could become a superhero with a utility belt full of kids books ,  just tap them time freezes beat up the bad guy ,  finish reading the kid book ,  time unfreezes .
 you’re faster than the flash
 good thing i can read braille .
 this is a much deeper reference than usual .
  &apos;my eyes aren &apos;t that bad ,  i &apos;ll just read the large print books &apos;
  &apos;picked up a korean unabridged dictionary by mistake .
 that was a long couple of centuries .
 wait ,  if you instantly absorb the knowledge of the dictionary from the moment you touched it ,  you wouldn &apos;t have to re-read it again ,  right ?
 just pick up the dictionary ,  and you are instantly fluent in the language .
 (then spend a few monotonous days reading it to unfreeze time)
 you have to read the book ,  not understand it .
 unfinished books aren &apos;t published ,  and since you know your limitations ,  you &apos;d never begin an incomplete book (as in read a draft by an author when it &apos;s incomplete) .
 there wouldn &apos;t be a back cover ,  though ,  would there ?
 i &apos;m pretty sure this power will help you understand any book .
 you wanna read a book in foreign language and understand it ?
 ok ,  just touch it and glaze past the pages ,  then you gain the instant knowledge and understanding
 easy solution ,  pick up a kindle or the like .
 no physical book to touch ,  no freeze
 realize you said that .
 something like nitrile gloves would probably work .
 the textured ones .
 or ,  if it’s not required to be a book you don’t know yet: just tape some bills together ,  you‘re gonna need at least some cash on your endevour anyway .
 fuck actually reading things at that ,  i have the powers of a god in my hands that are bound to getting over reading a book
 it doesn &apos;t say you need to know it to unfreeze time ,  it says you need to read it .
 you can read a book more than once ,  even if you know everything in it .
 i &apos;m also confused if the power grants full and complete knowledge simply by having read it ,  or if the implication is that by reading it you learn the information .
 i could read a book on advanced mathematics ,  but not understand it .
 what if it’s a different translation ?
 does that still count ?
 sounds like we already have this ability then ,  with the exception of knowing what is in a book .
 we can all freeze time !
 i can &apos;t think of any value to be derived from from  the book of numbers .
 my from begat a from
 is this a day after tomorrow reference ?
 i always figured that gods must be incredibly bored - they &apos;ve seen it all and they &apos;re going to see it all an infinite times because ,  well ,  gods .
 so if you come up with something that breaks the norm ,  something new ,  something imaginative - they like that .
 people in that era really cared a ton about genealogy i guess .
 you can’t hardly blame them .
 it’s not like they sat down and wrote the bible with people anything like us in mind .
 christians have the tanakh as part of our holy scriptures as well .
 obviously it came before but if you’re a christian you believe many parts of the old testament were put there by god specifically to point forward towards jesus .
 a huge part of the claim is that he fulfilled hundreds of old testament prophecies .
 the person you’re replying to has their knowledge of numbers displaced ,  they’re referring to something that happens in the gospels ,  but the general idea of the old testament having a specific meaning in christianity is not nonsensical .
 all it takes is somebody pulling a prank and writing a 1000 page essay in a small clifford book and your screwed lol
 clifford lore is deep and upsetting if you think too hard about it .
 the canonical reason why clifford got so big is because emily loved him so much .
 no other dogs or other creatures in universe have grown super huge .
 this forces us into one of a few cases .
 clifford isn &apos;t a dog ,  he &apos;s some kind of cosmic being that feeds on human emotions .
 this is unsettling primarily because it suggests the possibility of similar beings that are less benign ,  but this is still the most agreeable interpretation imo .
 emily isn &apos;t a normal girl but some kind of cosmic being whose love is reality bending .
 in addition to the weirdness that such beings can exist ,  this also suggests that emily doesn &apos;t love anything but clifford ,  which is sad for her family and friends .
 it also hints at a horrific idea of emily falling in love with someone and uncontrollably or forcibly transforming the body of her beloved .
 dogs in the clifford universe can be physically transformed by love ,  but emily is the only person who sincerely loves her dog .
 that &apos;s sad ,  and also makes love for a pet a kind of terrifying force .
 any being in the clifford universe can be physically transformed by love ,  but the only true loving relationship among any beings is between emily and clifford .
 that &apos;s sad and makes true love terrifying again .
 i will not be accepting corrections on my objectively flawless interpretation .
 yeah you’d have to at least understand the text as written if you were absorbing the knowledge .
 although maybe not be able to carry on a conversation in those language since your power is only limited to knowledge absorption and not language acquisition
 i love this game so much ,  i &apos;m really not a gamer ,  but i love this game so much i &apos;ll buy it again when it comes to the switch ,  despite already having it on pc .
 this will be the first game i &apos;ll have two copies of
 yeah me too i have a redbox to return
 this guy gets it .
 now it &apos;s just a freeze time whenever you want agility
 you have a stack of books you plan to read ,  you set them down and slip off your gloves .
 a person passing behind you at the library trips and knocks you forward .
 as you fall ,  instinct betrays you and you stretch out your arms in front of you ,  cursing as the stack of books topples ,  sending unread tomes flying around you - years worth of words flutter around you ,  you land in a pile of scattered pages .
 which did you touch first ?
 your heart skips a beat as you take in the magnitude of your error .
 how many combinations do you suppose there are of a dozen books in a stack ?
 then you die of old age before learning mandarin .
 whoopsie ,  sorry about that ,  universe !
 that’s a great answer and pretty much exactly what i was looking for !
 to gain the knowledge contained in that particular version of the book ,  the nuances of the language the book is written in would have to be understood and ,  in turn ,  inherently part of the breadth of knowledge gained from touching it .
 bravo and cheers !
 hang on though ,  the instant absorption works in that time freezes ,  you read it (with whatever inherent comprehension ability you have) and then when you &apos;re done ,  no time has passed .
 you have not aged and no one around you suspects you spent essentially an entire day reading a book .
 i think more info might be needed on the absorbsion part because it is ambiguous at best .
 the way i read it you &apos;re just reading a book ,  and gain whatever benefit from reading the book you would have gained had you read the book without time freeze power .
 it would not activate on a book you can &apos;t feasibly read
 just wear gloves while writing .
 very true and a brilliant comic because really ,  if superheroes were real there powers would be so much better utilised in situations other than beating up crooks in one city ,  in one country .
 ooh sorry your computer works fine but the server can &apos;t respond always times out .
 torrents though ,  well if your a super hero who &apos;s going to complain about a little piracy .
 or just get children’s books .
 like goodnight moon .
 it has a total of like 50 words lol
 imagine going blind while reading and having to learn braille by yourself ,  blind with no one to help you .
 if anyone is thinking that actor looks familiar ,  his name is burgess meredith and he played the penguin in the original batman tv series ,  and he was also rocky &apos;s trainer mickey in the rocky movies .
 oh man that’s like ,  my literal nightmare episode !
 it made me so upset that poor guy .
 all he wanted was to read .
 i remembered watching this episode as a wee child and being legitimately very upset for him .
 i thought they just pulled it from netflix ,  at least in the us .
 you are correct: my wife can read without glasses ,  though it is very difficult for her and she would have to strain her eyes .
 i gave that example to demonstrate that not all glasses are created equal ,  and that while most people could make do with off the shelf glasses there are some who cannot .
 i have worn the same pair of glasses since 2010 .
 however tomorrow i go in for an eye exam with an option for contact lenses and i &apos;m finally going to go to zenni optical and get me a number of new pairs of glasses so i can finally stop wearing this pair that has served me for so long .
 however to their credit they have lasted me this long with only minor scratching and absolutely zero breaks .
  but they can &apos;t take your winnings unless they can show to a court the way you are cheating .
 and if you play for high stakes you could win a lot of money before they conclude you are winning too often to be chance .
 or just cheat enough for a steady edge instead of trying to win every hand .
 after you already won .
 they can stop from continuing to gamble ,  they can &apos;t take your winnings .
  that &apos;s a real book ,  and that &apos;s the whole thing .
  it &apos;s called  &apos;bed time &apos; .
  i &apos;m not sure what the alligator is doing there either .
 feels like i &apos;m activating the winter soldier or something .
 children &apos;s books would essentially become magic grimoirs with incantations
 do you not get tired or hungry in this frozen time ?
 write your own haikus .
 we can publish them ourselves .
 touching one stops time
 better to get it out of the way upfront !
 why should i believe you ?
 “eh ,  saw it coming .
 yep ,  just read all the words .
 who cares if you can &apos;t make out a single word ?
 you &apos;ll still absorb all its knowledge .
 reverse monkey paw ,  boi !
 small nitpick ,  you &apos;d also need to read a grammar textbook because it &apos;s not just words themselves that you have to know
 you &apos;d be god at scribble ,  but i think most don &apos;t teach you to build sentences ,  nuance ,  and such .
 are you familiar with the tale of genji ?
 it ends halfway through a sentence in chapter 52 as though the author forgot to finish it or died (it was written over 1000 years ago) .
 i don &apos;t think it would matter if the author was finished writing it or not ,  only what &apos;s currently between the covers counts .
 even a blank book could be finished by looking at all the pages .
 unfinished books are published if the author has passed
 easy ,  learn how to bind books with your newly acquired free time .
 where are you seeing all these books with front covers but no back covers ?
 in the event such a volume does indeed exist ,  would the last sheet/page/leaf/whatever not be promoted to  &apos;back cover &apos; status by virtue of being at the back and also covering the rest of the pages ?
 actually makes sense .
 this is one of those cases where it &apos;s a question of how literal the superpower is .
 you read the first page in a kindle book .
 the kindle freezes .
 you can never access the second page .
 you are trapped forever .
 goodnight moon would forever be in my back pocket .
 i think this is an important distinction to note ,  if i had to comprehend it myself then i don &apos;t want the power but if simply reading all the words gave me the knowledge i &apos;m in .
 different wording ,  so have to reread .
 i mean ,  you can &apos;t expect reading the kjv to give you knowledge of the niv .
 as i mentioned in another comment ,  this is why i’d like to eventually re-write the bible for secular audiences .
 there’s no reason for anything but a broad overview of numbers and similar books ,  and genealogies could be literal ancestry charts and not lose much .
 when the kids are in the library trying to find stuff to burn ,  the librarian is arguing if they should burn books by freud and the one kid points to the references/legal section and says that line to get them to stop .
 later you can see all the piles of tax law books they were burning .
 yeah but i wonder when it &apos;s going to get this update that &apos;s it &apos;s been in the works for 2 years now .
 odds of winning powerball are a meager 292 million to 1 for comparison .
 all of you 144ers .
 perhaps the cruel twist of the monkey’s paw that granted this wish is that the order matters when in a nested time stop .
 it could be that each additional book is treated as an addendum to the previous one .
 one of the conditions was “cover to cover .
 ” if that’s the case ,  you’d have to read all 12 books in the order you fell into the time stop or else you do not gain the knowledge and time remains frozen .
 it’s a philosophical exercise dealing with magic and time stops .
 there’s more than one possible answer .
 a simpler version would be a book on advanced mathematics .
 assuming you knew nothing about math ,  absorbing the knowledge of the book would also give you the knowledge of the simpler math needed to do the advanced math .
 1+1=2 isn &apos;t written in the book ,  but you need to know that to understand the book .
 i was just thinking that this is almost like a r/writingprompts
 it &apos;s not fair at all !
 first book is about braille
 i get my  &apos;readers &apos; from zenni (i have a slight astigmatism)  .
 they have been great (if a bit slow to arrive) .
 my optometrist was reluctant to give me my pupillary distance at first ,  i think because so many people have moved to mail-order options ,  lol .
 the winter toddler
 on the bright side ,  if you chose to use your ability on this book ,  you would absorb the knowledge of the book instantly ,  and know what the alligator is there for .
 goddammit hurry up and understand what the alligator means ,  time is at a standstill until you do !
 instructions unclear ,  assassinated the prime minister of malta
 the only spell it would be capable of is time freeze .
 can you travel with the book while time is froze ?
 you could pull off some omae wa mou shit
 this is starting to get very code geass-like .
 if time is frozen you could eat any food that doesn’t require time in preparation .
 and if you get tired - take a nap without losing time
 they say a million monkeys with a million typewriters and long enough time would eventually at random type out every combination of everything that could ever possibly be written .
 so don &apos;t start reading that before the monkeys stop typing .
 is it really reading them if you can &apos;t even understand the symbols though ?
 you &apos;ve still finished the book ,  if not the story
 it wouldnt have covers anyway if it wasn &apos;t finished
 i like to bind ,  and be bound !
 i think i would keep a supply of short novellas around so i could touch one ,  take a 3 hour nap ,  read the book in an hour ,  and then continue on my day .
 i bought a copy of the book  &apos;god is disappointed in you &apos; which is supposed to be a layman retelling of the bible ,  but in true bibliophile fashion i have yet to read it .
 i think i would like to have a copy of the bible that is literally just  &apos;the specific instructions you must follow to lead a biblically sinless life (not accounting for the inescapable original sin) &apos;
 as a librarian myself ,  i freely admit that there are books in the library that i could burn without qualm in a life or death situation .
 at least at first .
 at some point i will start to freak .
 the website says it &apos;ll come in 2021 ,  but they also said that it &apos;ll come in 2019 and 2020 so .
 you don &apos;t need the exact combination ,  just to read the first book first ,  second book second ,  etc .
 you &apos;d only have to read every book 12 times in the exact same order .
 you &apos;ll eventually read them all in order and you &apos;ll only have to read a total of 144 books .
 i have 12 books .
 i read all 12 ,  and so am guaranteed to have read the first book .
 now i do it again ,  so i &apos;m guaranteed to have read the second book .
 keep going using that ,  and at most you &apos;ll read each book 12 times ,  for a total of 144 reads .
 though likely it &apos;ll be less than that .
 amazing and valid point right here !
 this adds more questions and doesn &apos;t resolve the logistics issue at play .
 if the mechanism is that time freezes until you finish reading the book ,  and you don &apos;t have the capability to read the book ,  is time simply frozen in perpetuity ?
 i hope this gets a story
 eh ,  saw it coming .
 things get strange beyond .
 i thought we may have issues with our optometrist but when i asked after my girls got their eye exams he said it was already on the card ,  and sure enough ,  it was .
 when i asked about it his exact response was  &apos;it is your medical data ,  not mine .
 so if an eye exam place gives you shit ask them how they would like to defend refusing to give a patient their medical data to a judge .
 then find a new place .
 20 years ago that many pair would have set you back a couple of grand easy .
 now with online options ,  i can get that for a little over 100 bucks with light lenses ,  anti-scratch and antireflective coatings ,  and the works .
 shipping is generally a bit long ,  but otherwise ,  i am looking forward to it .
 but if time is frozen then would you still need to eat or would everything just freeze while you read and then be exactly how they were before ?
 it was the best of times ,  it was the blurst of times ?
 yeah ,  you can  &apos;read &apos; in a foreign language but not understand anything you just read .
 i see you &apos;re also a five star man .
 i need my tools !
 oh shit ,  now you made me want this power .
 my life would improve so much with 3 free hours of sleep each day .
  &apos;yeah ,  he comes in a couple of times a week .
 he generally picks out a few children &apos;s books using fireplace tongs ,  puts them in this big jar he carries around for some reason ,  pays for them and leaves .
 now we’re using this power to its fullest potential .
 i just hope we stop aging during this time too .
 i once went camping with a bunch of friends and was using a paperback book to start the fire .
 one of my buddies was aghast as he is a librarian and demanded i stop .
 in my defense it was a james patterson novel that my aunt tried to sell at a half price book store and they declined .
 i’ll write it ,  might take some time tho there are plenty of other things i’d like to get around to doing lol
 hey ,  look at that weird mirror .
 i &apos;ll take a futurama reference anytime ,  anywhere
 i think our own metabolic process would be immune to the time freeze ,  it &apos;s too complicated a process to even move without space-time involved .
  so i think yeah you &apos;d need to eat and sleep as your own cells were behaving normally .
  what happens when you take a piss or worse ,  i dare not speculate
 \- damn ,  i warned you not to start reading  .
 love me some simpsons deep cuts
 think of how much money you would spend on food .
 if you can sleep etc in this time freeze it stands to reason you could get hungry as well .
 wait but that begs the question of what happens to your body when time is frozen .
 assuming you can still move about that means technically your body is still aging .
 so youd be growing older then everyone else each time you touch a book .
 am i allowed to answer if i &apos;m a guy ?
 because i ended up becoming  &apos;the excel guy &apos; in my office .
 all of my spreadsheets are exquisitely color-coded .
 my grade 9 science teacher forced us all to do it .
 he said that by colour coding everything you understood the material better because you had to think about it longer to colour code it and understand what other things it was associated with .
 not just zone out and go into transcribing mode .
 he also made us do end of unit study guides .
 they had to be colour coded ,   a set amount of drawings ,  and unit words and definitions .
 the drawings were doodles based on things in the unit .
 he would mark them and hand them back before the test which was great because he knew if he needed to help us with something before we bombed the test .
 he was also a mma fighter with cauliflower ears and not the type of guy you would expect to demand rainbow coloured notes .
 there &apos;s a lot of people asking for examples so i &apos;ll make one up this afternoon .
 there &apos;s a pm at my company that does this .
 no idea how the hell she has the focus and time to take such detailed technicolor dream-notes during meetings but i &apos;ve never had a problem with getting any relevant info from her so ¯\\\_()_/¯ .
 gotta respect note taking game like that .
 we all became bullet journalists
 certain law school prep guides teach you to take notes on court opinions using different colors .
  90% of first year law students show up with 4 different color highlighters .
  by the end of the last year ,  few still use them .
 in legal practice i have developed color coding for notes of the cases i &apos;m working on .
  i have not yet found a way to put a heart over the  &apos;i &apos; in my filings .
 i used different ink and highlighter colors to compensate for terrible add .
 i work in a chemistry lab now .
 sometimes i’ll still use brightly colored pens to record my results for fun ,  but i don’t ever switch between colors/color code anything anymore .
 all the different colored ink/highlighting helped me remember my notes come exam time ,  so now that i’m out of college ,  i don’t need to switch between colors .
 i lowkey miss color coding and taking notes sometimes ,  though .
 i will never forget sitting in class and asking the girl sitting next to me for a pen ,  and she turns back to me with a straight face and says to me  &apos;what color ?
 thank you for the award ,  that marks my first (but hopefully not the last) !
 i still color code based on class .
 each class has a color .
 this color includes the folder color ,  the pen color ,  the sticky note color that the assignments are written on and placed in my planner on the date they are due .
 i also teach intro statistics to undergraduates .
 where i also color-code parts of the equations and the values that get inserted to the equation ,  so the students can see where the numbers come from more easily .
 edited to change kids to students .
 that was a poor word choice on my part .
 i work in it ,  and yes .
 i still have all those colors and still use them all in my day planner .
 i &apos;m a medical lab technician .
 i took notes with a million different coloured pens in college ,  up until two years ago .
 i graduated at age 41 .
 just bought myself a nice new set of gel pens .
 real talk: multiple colours really helped me categorize and compress complex ideas into things i could remember .
 it helped a lot in understanding the material and studying for tests .
 i think they &apos;re teachers now ,  and yes ,  they still use all those colors .
 i work in an office setting now and do still like to use different colored pens for things ,  if the situation allows it .
 i don’t know if this will make sense to anyone else ,  but i love colors .
 i especially like the idea of colors being associated with ideas ,  personalities ,  names or themes .
 “oh ,  today is monday .
 i think orange is a good monday color .
 pink is friday .
 green is wednesday .
 ” i love how windows 10 allows me to change the colors of tiles so that my computer seems more like “me .
 ” i am constantly changing the colors of my apple watch face .
 i think i have a problem !
 eta: the thoughts and discussions being shared here have been very interesting and eye-opening !
 thanks for the silver as well .
 :) i do just want to add that i am fairly certain i do not have synesthesia .
 i know someone that does and from my very limited knowledge of it ,  it isn’t a voluntary association of colors like mine probably would be .
 i always automatically like to associate stuff with color or mood ,  but i don’t know that it happens involuntarily .
 think of what i do as more of what happens in the video game persona 5 ,  where each character has a color associated with them intentionally .
 i love that kind of stuff !
 my wife did this when we were in school and she still loves using multicolored pens for everything she can .
 she even uses her own pretty colors for writing in the labels for things at work .
 you can always tell work that was done by her from everyone else &apos;s .
 a true ray of sunshine .
 i told my wife about all the upvotes on this comment and she is thrilled about all the attention :) .
 edit 2: (1/27 7pm) thank you so much to both of the kind strangers who awarded this comment !
 never thought it would blow up so much !
 the wife is happy :)
  i &apos;m now a professional scientist and it makes my lab notebook pretty ,  plus frankly often it &apos;s really helpful to have multiple colors .
  i also like having a bunch of colors for seminar speakers because it somehow keeps me more interested to choose a different color for a different speaker .
 honestly though ,  the core reason is the main reason i enjoy multiple colors is because i often feel the secret to success against procrastination is negotiating with your inner five year old .
   &apos;ok ,  you need to write these notes ,  but if you do you can choose what color to write them in !
  &apos;  you might as well find a little happiness in the world where you can .
 unfortunately not allowed in the line of work i chose .
 so now i use 50 different colored post-it notes .
 improvise ,  adapt and overcome .
 i am a med student now .
 also i am failing because i no longer have time to use fancy pens and prepare colorful notes for all my classes .
 i’m one of those girls currently in college .
 i don’t do it because i’m organized or anything ,  i just fucking love buying pens/markers and otherwise i can’t pay attention to my notes .
 it’s aesthetically appealing to me ,  which immensely helps encourage me to actually take notes .
 i have a few friends that do that ,  one of them is studying to be a doctor ,  moved the colored pens to a tablet to easily switch colors .
 another wants to become a sign language translator(keep forgetting the actual term)
 a guy classmate of mine did this .
 one of the smartest in the class .
 his notes were fantastic .
 he &apos;s an engineer now and has a great family life from what i see on his fb .
 jason if you &apos;re reading this you rock my dude !
 they migrated to /r/fountainpens and use 50 different inks with 100 different pens now .
 i &apos;m a high school english teacher and there &apos;s a big correlation between note taking skills and success in my classes .
 color coding notes definitely helps .
 i mostly write everything in purple now ,  but sometimes i use other colors and i like colorful post it notes .
 i am working towards being a kindergarten teacher .
 i’m almost 35 ,  in college ,  and still using multi colored pens
 slow down ,  if you want a copy ,  message me .
 edit 2: i &apos;m sorry if i don &apos;t get to everyone ,  there &apos;s a lot you guys asking .
 hope you understand !
 have a nice day :) .
 i color-coded my notes .
 i have ocd and it makes everything feel neater and easier to flick through .
 if you want ,  i &apos;ll give my system as i found it to be very useful ,  maybe you will too .
 oh ,  and i am currently unemployed but due to the recent birth of my son ,  james ,  i &apos;ve been looking into jobs :) .
 or ,  an alternative way .
 i use black for titles and subtitles ,  as ,  for me ,  the title isn &apos;t that important .
 the dates are written in a subtle color ,  because the focus should be on the stuff below .
 i &apos;m not focusing on the title ,  more on the definitions ,  key words ,  diagrams ,  instructions etc .
 blue is the most used ,  as that &apos;s usually what i use for simple stuff .
 red is used for diagrams ,  definitions and instructions and research shows that red helps with more detailed information than blue .
 also ,  red is cool .
 i highlight key words in pastel pink because it looks pretty with blue and highlight in pastel orange because fire and shit .
 as for the summary ,  i write it in grey with a black border .
 it &apos;s a lot but i mainly just focus on aesthetic more than anything .
 i paint for a living ,  so i switched from pens to paint .
 the gel pens were fun but impractical .
 i stick to basic ink colors because it &apos;s easier to read things with a strong constrast .
 but i have sharpies in every color because doodling is fun .
 i &apos;m an engineer with dyslexia and adhd .
 i took notes with tons of colors and still do now .
 the colors help me stay organized ,  keep track of numbers and not mix up information .
 i keep  &apos;like with like &apos; categorically and have a whole notation system .
 a friend recommended i try it in college and it helped me go from c &apos;s to b+ and a &apos;s .
 i &apos;m good at  &apos;picturing &apos; notes and the colors helped to guide my brain to the relevant information in my memory picture ,  if that makes sense ?
 in all one color it just looked like a jumbled mess .
 either way ,  yes i still use colored pens as a 30 year old adult engineer 
 my cousin did this in hs ,  she is now a very organized and successful nurse .
 i went from being in school to be a grade school art teacher to stay at home/homeschooling mom to now finishing up a graduate degree in computer science and have job lined up as a software developer .
 and yes ,  i still use all those colors (and elflord in vim because colors !
 and it’s the easiest for me to read) .
 this reminds me of a girl in one of my college classes .
  it would be inaccurate to say she took notes .
  she took transcripts .
  she would write down everything in class .
  everything the teacher said ,  every quote from the book that we read .
  even every rabbit trail the class went down ,  she &apos;d be taking meticulous notes ,  including asking students for their first and last name so she could attribute the quotes properly .
 our mid-term  &apos;exam &apos; was a 10-page paper .
  she spent 30 hours on hers and got a 97% .
  i spent 2 hours on mine and got a 93% .
 i was much happier trading that 4% of my grade for 28 hours of my life .
 i had a friend who used to do that .
 one of the smartest people i knew .
 she is married now and has a kid and is a stay-at-home mom .
 i knew a guy who would take color coded notes in class .
 then immediately after class go through them and then do even more advanced color-coding with added references and stuff .
 he was probably the hardest working and smartest guy i &apos;ve ever known .
 and he grew up in a small village in venezuela and now is a us citizen and officer in the navy .
 made me embarrassed that he is a better speaker in two languages than i am in one .
 it &apos;s my time to shine !
 i really sucked at taking notes .
 i failed out of 7th grade .
 i scraped by in high school .
 i got into the lowest tier university in the state only because they automatically accepted anyone with an act score over 21 .
 then i flunked out .
 i eventually did graduate with a degree (that i never used) ,  but it was with a 2 .
 this is just to demonstrate how awful i was at note-taking ,  studying ,  anything involving recording and retaining information of the academic persuasion .
 then i decided i was really tired of living below the line of poverty and got a master &apos;s in science .
 this required being at the very least passable at recording and retaining academic information .
 this is where the copious color-coded pens came in .
 and the color-coded highlighters .
 and the color-coded sticky notes .
 and the color-coded accordion folders .
 i was finally able to properly record information in a way i could retain ,  which led to my appointment as research assistant ,  then contributions to multiple academic publications ,  and ultimately a dream job at the r&d division of a certain computer company .
 colored pens got me out of poverty  and gave me the ability to help provide for my family .
 tl;dr i now work as a researcher at a computer company .
 i am now paid to study .
 i still have all my pens .
 bold of you to assume that &apos;s a girl only thing .
 i don &apos;t write much anymore but i still use coloured pens for my personal notes .
 the colour depends on my mood .
 when i used to keep a meticulous fitness agenda ,  everything was colour coded .
 i have a bag of scented markers and a bag of rainbow pens i keep in my office for when i attend work meetings .
 also not a teacher but i am a director of a facility that serves kids .
 they now work for the fbi as it analysts .
 they are all called penelope garcia .
 ended up in med school so not doing bad i guess ?
 i do still continue color coding everything in college as i did in high school and before .
 my case of synesthesia lets me  &apos;see &apos; words ,  letters and certain concepts in different colors .
 by using the same colors to actually write the words or underline them i solidify the memory links in my brain and it helps me remember things .
 i also take graphic notes with arrows & double lines or write in groups of small areas ,  etc so that i can clearly categorize things i need to remember .
 if you &apos;re a visual lerner this helps a lot !
 4 colored pens are an absolute must for my job to keep organized .
 on my assignment sheet anything ordinary in black ,  code status in red ,  things i need to do in blue ,  lab results in green .
 then i &apos;m at peace .
 i &apos;m a dramatic artist and i used all the pens just for that .
  my teachers hated me for giving them rainbows of notes and work but i always wrote them a little key on the back of the paper so they grudgingly accepted it .
 except one math teacher who liked and looked forward to my stuff .
 i &apos;m now a dog boarder and my schedules are so colorful only i can decipher them .
 i still art but not as much unfortunately :(
 we all have bulletjournals now
 wife did this as a kid ,  through high school and became amped in college .
 but now she &apos;s a teacher and writes in different colors for a living .
 we &apos;re currently moving out of the country and she can &apos;t part with pens she doesn &apos;t even use .
 she managed to smuggle them into her carry on bag .
 as a guy who has been doing this for almost 7 years of uni now ,  i can say that its absolutely worth it .
 pleasant looking and well organized notes go a long way to make reviewing material 100 times more enjoyable
 i am still in school ,  i used to get straight a’s ,  but now im not even straight .
 i spend to much to asking girls to borrow their pens .
 im (m22) in university and this year im trying to really improve my studying and note taking outside of lectures .
 so ,  i decided to do 3 coloured notes with red blue and black pens because all i the girls i know take notes like that and they all have much better gpas than i do
 i graduated with my phd .
 i still have a love of extremely neat notes with color coding and fonts and neatly drawn graphs .
 my licensing exam study binder was a thing of beauty and i actually wound up making a power point presentation for last years residents on the exam and study tips ,  complete with several personalized memes .
 this shit brings me so much joy :)  .
 i still have about 8 different colors of pens in my office ,  although now all my reports are typed and have to conform to a particular aesthetic so i &apos;m stuck .
 i do ,  however ,  now have a handmade stone pen courtesy of my father in law and a very cool fountain pen made from trimmed branches of a 100 year old olive tree that my husband gifted me .
 so no more neat colors but my love of excellent writing materials lives on .
 i was exactly this girl ,  i had about 50 glittery coloured gel pens ,  and for each school assignment i would choose 5 random different ones to write and decorate my notebooks with .
 20 years later ,  i &apos;m a graphic designer and illustrator !
 i still love making things nice and colourful with cool typography .
 i basically did not change at all ,  i just have slightly better taste now .
 not a girl but in my business law class during undergrad we were allowed to use our notes for the tests .
 it was much easier to color code everything so i could find it quickly if i needed to reference it (different colors for terms ,  cases ,  outcomes ,  etc) .
 i’ve been unemployed for about 6 months
 homeschooling sahm here .
 i use one set of colors for my personal planner (each person has their own color ,  bills have one ,  holidays and birthdays share one ,  family and community events have their own ,  and finally the animals have a color .
 )  school planning has another set for each subject
 formatting an excel doc and making it look pretty is one of the most satisfying feelings in the world .
 i never took the colored notes and my handwriting is atrocious ,  but i made up for it in excel design .
 i once had a girl tell me  &apos;your spreadsheets are sex &apos;  .
 i think she meant sexy ,  but somehow the misspelling made it so much better for my ego .
 worked with a guy who gave me shit about playing video games .
  turns out he had a spreadsheet of his spreadsheets .
  who &apos;s the dork now ?
  great guy ,  though .
  you can always trust the excel guy .
  well ,  unless he &apos;s got a spreadsheet of his victims ,  but how common can that be ?
 you are the it departments worst nightmare .
 your visually appealing excel spreadsheets make people daisy chain needlessly complex and pointless formulas ,  in an effort to attempt things that should be done in a database ,   .
 their  &apos;creations &apos; then become unusable and they complain at us for not supporting their usage .
 haha loving the responses and differing perspectives ,  rip my inbox though .
 edit 2: thank you for gold kind stranger
 i &apos;m just commenting to give you a tip .
 (if you dont already) ,  please for the love of god include a color key as to what they represent .
 there is nothing worse than looking at a spreadsheet someone else did and wondering  &apos;what does green mean &apos;  &apos;why are some orange and others pink &apos; and stuff like that .
 as a colorblind person i hate you
 but did it work  ?
 my us gov teacher tried this and we fought so hard on it .
 i eventually ended up telling him that i &apos;d make a study guide when he made a test i couldn &apos;t pass without it and he got me transferred to his ap course and i got destroyed .
 thanks ,  mr harris
 i don’t take notes with colored pens but i do highlight textbooks with different colors .
 usually it’s yellow: key ideas ,  pink: definitions ,  and blue: theories .
 it helps me understand the content to have to pull back and really think about everything in context and decipher what are the key ideas in this text
 the physical act of writing something down reinforces the encoding to memory .
  however ,  it often only gives one pathway to it .
  by making the learning multimodal ,  you are adding multiple areas of encoding ,  and creating links between the nodes where the memory resides .
 i was a stem/premed major and then grad school .
  and weirdly ,  almost everyone i knew that was getting a &apos;s had similar learning strategies .
  a lot of them used colored pencils .
 i &apos;m looking down at my desk and i have a red/blue pencil right next to me (its different colors on both sides) .
 i print out papers i &apos;m working on and use it to mark things up these days -- i used to do it on my tablet ,  but this is actually quicker .
  in the end ,  little things like this make you more efficient .
 then again ,  it &apos;s monday and i &apos;ve been on reddit all day ,  so what do i know about efficiency !
 what an awesome teacher !
 “technicolor dream-notes” is the best phrase i’ve heard all day .
 a good pm is solid fucking gold .
 if she ever moves to another company ,  follow her there .
 i move that the term “bullet journalists” replace “war correspondents” .
 i was looking for this comment !
 i take notes on my computer at work ,  so i take out my pen obsession on bullet journals !
 pilot precise v5 extra fine is my pen of choice these days .
 you won &apos;t be disappointed .
 and we’ve expanded to include washi tape as well as pens .
 surprised not to see r/bulletjournal further up
 save that for any judge with an i in their surname .
 i had a law school classmate who tried to claim that her highlighting/margin notes actually made her used conlaw text book more valuable ,  because she did well in the class .
 i replied to the list serve and offered my book for cheap because i got a bad grade .
 neither book sold because the school started using a new edition .
 you mean legally blonde was a lie ,  and no one submits their cv on pink scented paper ?
 same but i kept it up throughout law school and beyond .
 i also use color coding in my paper calendar to differentiate between docs due ,  research due ,  meetings ,  etc .
 i recently learned how to color code certain emails in outlook based on sender or topic .
 it &apos;s really helpful and so much more fun than boring black or blue ink .
 prep guide for law school: .
 sell your soul in exchange for the forbidden knowledge .
 don &apos;t bother reading the terms and conditions .
 regret not reading the small print .
 ¿endless case law ?
 when you took the time to color code during class ,  did you ever become seriously behind as the teacher moved on ?
 if so ,  how did you compensate ?
 also have horrible adhd .
 when i was in college ,  i had to write notes by hand ,  even for things that the professor said i didn &apos;t need to write down .
 because if i let myself stop taking notes ,  i &apos;d stop paying attention ,  and when he switched back to the important shit i &apos;d forget to start again .
 i also had to doodle a lot in the margins .
 ironically ,  doodling helped keep me present in the moment instead of off in my own head .
 it kept keep me grounded to the real world .
 but ,  one of the funny things i would do a lot ,  was write what the current time was in the margins .
 so for a block of notes i &apos;d have like 11:45 written in the margin ,  then 12:00 in the next section ,  etc .
 i didn &apos;t even really realize i was doing it ,  but one day i loaned my notes to someone to copy and she laughed because she thought i was doing it on purpose to keep track of how long the professor spent on each subject to categorize by importance or something .
 nope ,  just trying not to start thinking about how the universe works in my sociology class .
  &apos;what color and do you need a matching highlighter ?
  &apos; was my go-to response in college .
 i forget not everybody is as color coordinated as i am !
 i don &apos;t know why that made me get a little misty-eyed .
 i was totally that girl .
 whenever i ask my wife for a pen i have to specify  &apos;preferably no glitter &apos; .
 half the time she only has pens with glitter in the colours anyway .
 she &apos;s 40 and absolutely the girl who took notes with multiple colours .
 she &apos;s also super organised but laid back and amazing .
 which of these 47 shades of red would you like ?
 you &apos;re my favorite type of math teacher !
 all of the teachers who used color to help me learn math were the ones who actually got stuff to stick .
 where i also color-code parts of the equations and the values that get inserted to the equation ,  so the kids can see where the numbers come from more easily .
 you are the type of math teacher i wish i had .
  i would have probably been better at math if mine did that .
 your students must love you as a teacher !
 i don &apos;t think i ever expected to find organization hot but here i am
 i &apos;m a lab technologist and i studied the same way .
  using the different colors to write important information really helped it stand out in my brain .
  plus ,  anything that makes studying even a little more fun helps !
 random question: do you have any advice for someone that is going back to school a little later in life ?
 was it a challenge for you ?
 were there any emotional challenges ?
 (yes ,  i am also a teacher .
 yes ,  my desk drawer is a rainbow of pens .
 and i have adhd ,  what is this thread ?
 i cant believe we are all teachers .
 this hit me really close .
  the only job i love and where my stationery obsession doesn &apos;t look awkward .
 feels good to be a teacher ,  i love it tbh .
 not a teacher but an administrative assistant and yes i have all the colors and use them _
 yes i am and yes i do
 teacher chiming in .
 i use different colours when writing notes for my students and i have lots of fun doing it !
 on wednesdays we wear pink
 i do the same thing with colors for days/moods !
 monday is usually brown because it’s monday ,  but my favorite day is wednesday (usually purple) .
 i don’t think it’s bad at all !
 do you also color-code your lab notebook binding colors ?
 that’s a hugely popular thing to do in my lab ,  haha .
 still in phd program but the goal is to use each color of lab tape to mark a notebook before you leave .
 most people end up with 5-6 notebooks ,  and it looks awesome walking through the bench rows .
 if i may ask ,  what line of work are you in that prohibits the choice to use different colored pens ?
 yeah i &apos;m only allowed to use black ink to sign off on stuff for most of my work ,  so i have different colored highlighters and post its and i just focus my pen energy on buying my favorite kinds of pens ,  instead .
 i do have a whole bunch of colored ones for home ,  though .
 had to switch to typing for my notes and i still take longer than others .
 anki &apos;s great for discrete memorization ,  but i just get so much out of making my own notes .
 i still hoard pens ,  markers ,  colored pencils ,  and post its .
 my color coding still exists with expo markers when i &apos;m white boarding biochem or something .
 also a doctor here .
 i gave up trying to make pretty notes after like two months into the semester each year .
  never really made notes in med school classes as such after that .
 i used to append my textbooks like a maniac tho .
 my robbins and cotran path looks like unicorn vomit .
 i highly recommend doing that .
 i did attend this exam prep class for pharmacology once .
 we did all of pharmacology in 60 hrs over 5 days .
 ended up with 600 pages of multicoloured pretty handwritten notes ,  repetitive strain injuries in my wrist and calluses over my fingers .
 the colours were absolutely worth it .
 11/10 would always make notes like that .
 don &apos;t let med school suck the colours out of your life .
 use them wherever and in any form .
 coloured pens ,  highlighters ,  post its .
 make it fun and make it work for you .
 adapt ,  improvise and overcome !
 also ,  btw ,  pastel highlighters are the shit .
 like for real ,  they will change your life .
 sign language translator -- interpreter
 between this comment and the bullet journaling one ,  i &apos;m feeling awfully called out by this thread right now .
 so many pretty inks and pens ,  and journals to use them in ,  so little time .
 teachers do approve of it .
 my teachers used to tell my i’d fail either high school and/or higher education because i was wasting too much time on my colors .
 an autocorrect-induced typo that apparently is telling beyond reasonable doubt that i don’t know my grammar
 i wonder if the students who just enjoy school and want to put time/effort in are the students that color coded notes .
 not the notes themselves that help ,  but the type of student who takes them will likely be successful regardless of the color ,  and students who don &apos;t take the color coded notes don &apos;t care as much ,  and therefore wouldn &apos;t be as successful
 what are studying in college ?
 also ,  you &apos;ve got this !
 if you want ,  i &apos;ll give my system as i found it to be very useful ,  maybe you will too .
 i &apos;m honestly very interested in what systems are used ,  because i &apos;ve always wondered about that .
 as i said elsewhere on this thread ,  i definitely see the connection between art and color-coded notes ,  because sometimes i would look at some of my classmates &apos; notes ,  and it felt as if i was looking at a pollock painting .
 she probably got a lot more out of it than 4% of a grade .
 like ,  knowledge and stuff .
 the reason you &apos;re in class .
 that being said ,  i would probably also choose the 2 hour 93% .
 (this isn &apos;t supposed to be snide .
 i just like to remind people that the point of classes is not to get an a) .
 i can only imagine that calendar in their kitchen .
 marking up drawings - red for add ,  green for delete ,  blue for notes to drafter and pencil/black for notes to self .
 unfortunately most of my co-workers are stuck in their ways and only use red to mark up drawings .
 that &apos;s all well and good if this was 1990 and the drafter sat next to you .
 unfortunately it &apos;s 2020 and the drafter is likely someone you &apos;ve never met located in a different time zone .
 it &apos;s entirely on you if your drawing comes back with  &apos;move this !
  &apos; written in the middle of the page .
 took notes by hand all through law school in the same colors (though rarely used green) to annotate running a outline/algorithmic summary of the relevant area of law .
 people who don’t use more than one color are missing out .
 pilot v5 extra fine master race .
 thank you this made me smile
 the real trick is getting the conditional formatting juuuuust so .
 then ,  when you enter new data ,  it’s already color coded
 it’s also one of the easiest ways to impress people at the office and have them call you “excel wizard .
 actually ,  something  &apos;is sex &apos; is an actual expression that i &apos;ve heard before .
 it has more oomph to it ,  so people sometimes say it instead of sexy .
 generally ,  to have the effect described by your last sentence .
 bold of you to assume my company has an it department ,  or would be willing to switch to using a database .
 oh ,  man ,  then you &apos;re going to hate my macros and userforms .
 this is me ,  but our it department won &apos;t give us any db software so the war rages on
 i was both the it-lady and the excel-sorceress .
 my company refused to allow me to use databases .
 we used excel for everything .
 some of the accounting people had excel files that would make super computers tank .
 it was a fucking nightmare .
 shit with like 100+ sheets in 1 workbook ,  with tons of formulas ,  pivottables ,  so on .
 i bet that people that do that also don &apos;t label their axes when they make charts .
 at least for uni level math ,  a 4-color ballpoint pen can be a freaking lifesaver ,  since you often sketch multiple functions in the same graph ,  or do different vectors in 3d ,  etc .
 i and pretty much everyone else used it all the way thru school .
 don’t forget about orange for important dates !
 i wish they wouldn &apos;t but my unis tended to encourage drawing ,  visualizing ,  mnemonics ,  memory cues ,  and the  &apos;rubber duck debug &apos; (though they don &apos;t call it that) for distinctive encoding to make recall easier .
 physically writing things down (copying a textbook or notes over and over) is considered dated and doesn &apos;t help a lot of people since it can be done mindlessly and is now discouraged .
 i can &apos;t picture anything in my mind so writing things down mindfully works best for me and i go ham colours to help me break down sections .
 my violin teacher used to tell me laziness is efficiency and musicians are some of the laziest people out there .
 that &apos;s one big thing high school should teach .
 how to study and organize notes .
 it &apos;s also why a lot of people who can coast through high school without studying or taking notes struggle in post secondary .
 josie and the astounding technicolor dream-note
 i wrote my note ,  with golden lining .
 bright colours shining ,  wonderful and new .
 and in the east ,  i was still drawing .
 but the world was boring .
 any pen won’t do
 i’ve found there isn’t much in the middle ground for pms and a good one is hard to come across .
 either they’re great and a project runs so smoothly you don’t even notice they’re operating ,  or they’re horrible and even a small fuck up daisy chains into a major issue because they don’t catch it and/or have contingency plans .
 had a competing gc years back that totally missed an under counter plug mold until the entire kitchen was done .
 $30 part and $75 in labor ,  but it’s code for a kitchen island (can’t drape cords over walkways in kitchen ,  have to have plugs on island) .
 had to remove an entire huge counter and thereby undermount sink ,  disposer ,  filter ,  faucet ,  etc so electricians could get to it .
 $100 turned into about a $5 , 000 mistake all because he didn’t catch it until inspection time .
 my partner is a pm and i always wonder if he &apos;s good at it .
 i only know home-him ,  whose eyebrows i pluck and farts i endure .
 i have been a pm for a decade ,  recently promoted to associate director .
 i mentor new pms at my company ,  and my advice is to document ,  document ,  document .
 taking accurate and detailed notes is critical to this .
 does that mean wankers are palm pilots ?
 dad level pun with callous undertones .
 i hate myself for upvoting you .
 i was one of these girls and wanted to be a war correspondent when i grew up .
 mmm the v5 is so smooth and satisfying
 just wanted to chip in and say that writing with pilot pens literally gives me a high .
 i haven &apos;t found a better pen ,  and always use those and ones from the asian stationary store near me
 uni-ball signo 0 .
 i tend to write on the small side so having an extremely fine point pen is beneficial .
 plus a lot of the things i write are immediately handed to other people and a smudge can drastically alter the text ,  so the smudge resistance is a big plus .
 i &apos;ve gone through boxes of these pens ,  and i doubt i ever finished a single pen before discovering these .
 if somebody finds one of my pens at work they immediately bring it to me because they know how i feel about them lol
 why doesn &apos;t the faq post on that sub start with  &apos;what is this ?
 uuwwuuu hello iito-san !
 (‿) look at my kawaii case file !
 do you like donuts ?
 i have some in my briefcase i can share with you .
 don &apos;t get glitter on you !
 oh ,  here ,  let me help .
 uuwuuuu can i touch it ?
 save it for the judge !
 most colors mean you shouldn &apos;t say it
 most colors mean don &apos;t say it
 maybe my all-time favorite michael scott quote
 man i love the office ,  thanks for reminding me
 i actually enjoyed buying books filled with notes .
 most of the time it just made me feel smart ,   &apos;wait ,  this idiot that had the book before me didn &apos;t already know this ?
 what a dumbass &apos;
 the library near my house actually does sell annotated books from the local schools for more than the normal copies (but they aren &apos;t textbooks ,  more like novels assigned to middle and high schoolers .
 gotta be honest  .
 old annotations in used books saved my ass more than once during cold calls lol .
 what a roller coaster of a comment there ,  counselor
 so a lose ,  lose ,  win as michael scott would &apos;ve said .
 submitted a lab report on curry scented paper ,  but thats cause i packed the printer paper next to the spices when we moved .
 i review job applications and resumes in my work .
 yes ,  people submit them on colored paper and with festive choices of ink .
 scented would be a new one for me ,  but i &apos;m still holding out hope !
 now wait a second ,  this sounds like a warlock lawyer i made as a backup character in d&d .
 1) lie sit down .
 2) try not to cry .
 still waiting in 5 .
 student loans are a bitch .
 i would write my original notes and only switch colors every now and then during the lectures .
 after class ,  though ,  i would recopy and reorganize my notes very thoroughly ,  and that’s when the color coding would take place .
 it’s honestly a great system- i never really had to study because i could remember my notes so well after doing this .
 not op but i used coloured pens for similar reasons .
 i didn &apos;t use them all in class .
 class was for quick notes and following handouts .
 note revision -- making detailed notes from the class notes and textbooks -- was when i could bust out my best handwriting and pretty colours and draw nice diagrams and stuff .
 people don &apos;t understand the importance of note revision and studying from the texts .
 in high school you don &apos;t learn that because most people can skate by if they just pay attention in class .
 but you can &apos;t do that once you get to college .
 not op but i didn &apos;t really copy things in class; the color coding was just a way to occupy one track of my brain (and also to make my notes easier to read ,  add makes big blocks of similar text incomprehensible) .
 with add my brain is constantly running three tracks ,  and if one of them isn &apos;t occupied i &apos;ll get distracted .
 so i kept one of them in writing things down ,  one for the color coding and one listening to the teacher .
 i wrote down key points from the board and also what the teacher said ,  but never ever copying bc it &apos;s boring and my brain just doesn &apos;t want to pay attention .
 it’s funny you mentioning needing to doodle to keep your attention because i remember hearing about a study where they were looking for new ways to keep the attention of children in class because they can be fidgety and such .
 the best method they found to keep their attention was to keep them blindfolded but let them doodle on paper while listening to the teacher .
 although you might not have been blindfolded ,  i still think it’s interesting that even at higher academic levels doodling can help students pay attention .
 i always have a giant note file open when i &apos;m doing anything at the computer (such as programming) .
 i open a new one at the beginning of each year .
 it &apos;s usually formatted in some simple way ,  such as markdown (also (used) by (reddit) in the comments) so that i can use automatic syntax highlighting .
 i very rarely refer back to something i &apos;ve written down ,  although it &apos;s nice to know it &apos;s there .
 the main use of it is to put some structure into my thoughts .
 i make lists with multiple indentation levels ,  some highlighting ,  writing down pros and cons .
 most importantly after getting distracted for the nth time i can still just look at my notes ,  see what i had just been writing ,  and then hopefully continue where i left off .
 i doodled often while taking notes in high school .
 if i didn &apos;t i would get sucked into the fantasies in my head playing on repeat .
 some of my old notes have all of the margins covered in overlapping doodles .
 i also doodled on tests in classes where i knew the teacher wouldn &apos;t lose their shit .
 they helped me to think out a problem if i was having difficulty with something .
 i drew an entire scene once on the back of my test while working through a problem on scratch paper .
 your username adds volumes to your comment
 i didn &apos;t know that was something others did !
 what do you mean matching ?
 like green pen green highlighter ?
 or green pen and a highlighter color that goes well with green ?
 amy santiago wants to know your location
 no kidding ,  that &apos;s so smart ,  i &apos;m going to have to do that .
 where were you when i was trying to get my head around mathematics at uni .
 well fuck now i &apos;m mad at most every math teacher for not thinking of this ,  its a brilliant idea .
 probably wouldn &apos;t have changed much for me ,  but thie would be a game changer for others ,  especially for people who struggle with math
 i &apos;m colorblind so i hate all of you .
 seriously though ,  i can get like yellow and blue highlighters and that &apos;s it .
 i &apos;m a first year lab tech student and i love my coloured pens !
 i never used colours in high school but now that studying is so important they add some fun and whimsy to arduous note-taking .
 first of all ,  the stuff that made it easier: my husband was working full-time ,  we were able to pay rent and everything on his income ,  and i had just got a small inheritance from my grandmother .
 i went to school on that and only needed to take out a small loan at the end .
 i had gone to university and flunked out in my early 20s .
 i found there were a lot of things that made school easier when i was older .
 first ,  my time management skills were way better .
 when i was younger i procrastinated doing the boring stuff (like studying) because i wanted to do fun stuff .
 now i have the perspective to understand that the fun stuff will still be there after i &apos;ve done the work ,  and that i &apos;m doing this work because i want to so i &apos;d better do it right .
 i went to a community college for a two-year degree (and could have gone to the local university for another two and made it a bachelor &apos;s ,  but the associate &apos;s was the minimum to work in the field and i ran out of money) .
 community college is great because there are no dorms ,  there &apos;s no campus party life ,  and people generally don &apos;t go there for prestige or because it &apos;s expected .
 they go there to pick up skills and certification and get to work .
 it &apos;s very no-nonsense and you don &apos;t have the emphasis on partying and all that kid stuff .
 i think there were two people in my class who were older than me ,  but very few of them were fresh out of high school .
 overall ,  it was emotionally a really good experience because it proved to me that i do have skills and ability to do this kind of thing (which i didn &apos;t have when i was younger) .
 this is the proof that girls who used colour pens will eventually become a guy .
  did some teaching .
  was always fascinated by writing implements ,  especially fountain pens .
  started ordering nice ink from noodler &apos;s .
  mostly using japanese pentec and pilot pens in green and purple at the moment .
  it &apos;s all true .
 i always wondered -- do the colors signify something ?
 in other words ,  did you have an overarching system that you followed when choosing the colors ?
 my gf was teacher ,  now she manages a boutique hotel and still uses all the colors for reports .
 during brekkie this morning she created a guest departure chart for the cleaning crew and she color coordinated the arrivals and departures for the week .
 i have adhd too ,  colored pens are a must
 my wife is a lawyer .
 she uses blue and black ink on actual original contract documents .
 everything else she writes ,  her notes ,  markups of documents ,  messages to coworkers (or me) ,  is always pink ,  purple ,  green ,  sky blue ,  red ,  whatever other colors she can find .
 she also takes all her notes on blue or pink paper .
 her admin has to pull all kinds of back office dealings and outright fraud in order to keep her properly supplied .
 haha ,  i &apos;m not a teacher !
 i worked at an engelineering firm .
 all my pens are coloured !
 you can &apos;t sit with us !
 use a better colour for monday to make it better ,  dont make it twice as bad by giving it a bad colour :)
 wish that was a real sub
 at a previous job ,  the only color allowed was blue .
 i worked at a manufacturing site in operations ,  and in order to maintain iso certification ,  only blue was allowed .
  also ,  if you had any other color even in your purse it could be a write up .
 no one ever checked ,  so unless you were a dumbass and pulled it out ,  no one ever knew .
 also ,  white out was a huge nono .
 having whiteout at your desk would mean an instant audit fail ,  so anyone caught with it was instantly fired .
 wasn &apos;t even allowed in the building .
 not op ,  but: i use blue ink only for work .
 blue ink is original ,  and our records and property divisions would have a fit if i signed/initialed anything in hot pink or neon green or something .
 some people use black ink ,  but it &apos;s more difficult to tell when it &apos;s a copy .
 i don &apos;t even carry black pens in my bag or clipboard .
 i have one mechanical pencil for sketches ,  a red ultrafine sharpie ,  and a china marker that i carry in my gear bag for when i need options .
 i use different colored sticky notes at my desk to somewhat color code .
 yellow for everyday shit ,  but green are the important things .
 am in the law enforcement field .
 i buy my own pens because i &apos;m picky .
 quartermaster only gives out the worst plastic black ink crappy pens .
 i also buy my own blue twin tip sharpies .
 these are the best !
 the ultrafine point is amazing for labeling swab boxes and little stuff .
 the fine point is great for signing tape seals on my evidence and the bigger stuff .
 improvise ,  adapt and overcome .
 any company with a high-end quality system like aerospace or medical manufacturers have all kinds of documentation control requirements ,  often including limitation to blue/black pens for photocopying and clarity
 my wife is an intern this year ,  and did almost the same thing in med school .
 she didn &apos;t record the lecture ,  but typed them up ,  and had some app on her ipad that let her highlight ,  and make little notes in different colors .
 once she found that app she was so much happier
 luckily we don &apos;t have to go to lecture in my med school .
 we can use any resource we want .
 but if we do want to view our lectures we can watch them online which is way better for taking notes .
 her labcoat is tie dyed so i wouldn &apos;t be surprised lol
 we all start out with a $20 pilot metro and a bottle of ink and before you know it ,  you have 4 shades of blue ,  3 reds ,  4 other random colors and can &apos;t decide which pen to load which ink with because they all have character and each ink only matches with a specific pen .
 then you are trying to justify a namiki to your significant other by saying  &apos;it &apos;s just a few months of saving .
  &apos; despite purchasing an aurora two weeks ago .
 because you wanted to try a pen with feedback .
 ask me how i know .
 and let &apos;s not get started on the paper criesintomoeriver
 color-coding meant that i knew how to categorize stuff ,  which which in turn means i had to understand it first .
  to me it was a more active way of taking notes ,  other than going full auto with my hand writing without any help from the brain .
  just general it/desktop support/network administration stuff .
  i appreciate the vote of confidence !
 every time i &apos;ve offered ,  it usually ended up with them telling me to fuck off lol .
 i &apos;d be happy to lend it you ,  of course ,  if you don &apos;t mind :)
 lit up like a christmas tree
 would you like me to pm you my work nipple ?
 the sweet sensation of conditional formatting and data validation working together while inputting new data is something i &apos;ll enjoy forever
 not quite there yet though .
 gotta use vba to create a gui for all the other people who want to use the document ,  so they don &apos;t delete things or ruin the formatting .
 because they will fuck it up .
 share your spreadsheet !
 i would also like in on this spreadsheet
 this is exactly what me and my girlfriend tried to set up last semester with no luck .
 i am a 2nd semester business admin student so i’m just starting out ,  but stuff like that is one of the end goal :)
 share your spreadsheet with us .
 give us the template !
 wait there &apos;s more of us ?
 happy to hear im not the only one obsessed with making my spreadsheets easy on the eyes .
 i am so intrigued by your spreadsheet ,  would you mind sharing ?
 that &apos;s where i &apos;m at .
 each project uses a massive excel sheet with tabs for every month ,  columns for every day of the month ,  rows containing the 400+ items  .
 and a matching parallel grid for their cost effect .
  they all reference each other and compile on the yearly split by months page ,  then again on the main summary page of the sheet .
 it &apos;s sooo slow ,  even on my gaming computer at home .
 instead of typing in the item number and then a quantity ,  you scroll and scroll until you get to the item then trace across and try to line it up with the day of the month .
 no way to build a history of that item without scrolling through each tab and recording it yourself .
  drop one thing in the wrong cell and it &apos;s all fucked and there &apos;s likely not a way to figure it out besides repopulating the entire month/day with the field recorded quantities .
 the it grunts hate dealing with it ,  we hate using it ,  there &apos;s database softwares designed especially for this .
 but no  &apos;excel works fine just use it &apos;
 exactly as i expected .
 yes ,  yes we will !
 sqlite on a shared drive ,  the ultimate tool in shadow it
 i never used colors though high school and most of college ,  because using multiple pens was too much of a hastle ,  but i recently started using an ipad and use mutiple colors in onenote .
 not having to switch what is in your hand ,  and still using a writing utensil the size of a regular pencil is amazing .
 studied electrical engineering at uni .
 the 4 colour pen helped a bunch when taking notes
 mma guys need to know how to keep doing stuff that works and stop doing things that don &apos;t work ,  or else they get beat up .
 this comment is the best part of your story
 if it’s not too much trouble ,  could i ask for a more in-depth explanation of your teacher’s method ?
 i’ve been employing a lot of organizational and productivity techniques that i’ve read about ,  but i haven’t come across much on color coding except for more obvious purposes like by section .
 i really enjoy techniques that make me slow down and analyze what i’m doing ,  and the manual process you describe here sounds right up my alley .
 and if you don’t have time to explain it ,  it’s no worries at all .
 thanks for sharing !
 did you end up joining the marines ?
 that &apos;s me you &apos;re talking about !
 turned out i couldn &apos;t play modern warfare 2 all the time and pass calculus .

 thank you for your creativity !
 who ate the cost ?
 home-me and work-me are basically the same ,  which means i have found a wonderful career .
 not gonna lie i thought it was prime minister  lmao im so confused
 snaps fingers into finger guns:   yes
 i love the g-2 and have told my coworkers that taking one off my desk is an offense that comes with swift retribution .
 that &apos;s a bit redundant .
 most stores are stationary .
 try out a fountain pen .
 you might just orgasm from the experience .
 because they appreciate their obscurity
 this is the reddit equivalent of a car crash you can &apos;t look away from .
 the dick emoji at the end slayed me ,  as if the rest wasn &apos;t already ridiculous lol

 i hate it ,  but it &apos;s brilliantly done .
 why do you exist ?
 seven years dungeon .
 if the gwove down &apos;t fitsu ,  you must aquitso .
 i un-ironically love this comment .
 between kobe dying ,  the impeachment trial ,  coronavirus ,  and a shit ton of personal bs i &apos;m dealing with 2020 hasn &apos;t been great .
 except for this right here ,  this is great
 why are you the way you are ?
 what did i just read
 i lost it at  &apos;do you like donuts ?
 he really was a genius at times .
 i enjoy the insight into what other people think is important in the text
 forty two year old reading a 5 year olds textbook
 we have a term for people who make excellent notes on a subject useful for learning from ,  and that term is not student .
 the important difference here is that only the publishers win for negotiating a successful monopoly resolution .
 10/10 would hire the person with the curry resume over a resume of equal achievement that just smelled like paper .
 the fuck kind of mad packing system do you have ?
 best resume i ever got was for an art student applying to be a gallery assistant ,  and all of the sections of their resume were in bubbles floating around the page .
  and under  &apos;special interests &apos; it just said  &apos;cheese .
 do you discard resumes because of this ?
 i used this technique through hs and college .
 pay close attention and take brief notes in class .
 read text and revise notes .
 use a condensed outline or note cards to review/study .
 generally ,  after going over/revising the notes in different formats ,  very little studying was needed and i retained the info much longer .
 i never really had to study .
 that was how you studied .
 detailed revision of learned material -a .
 i would do an adapted cornell style for my notes when i would recopy my notes .
 i’d fold all of my pages in half- one column for lecture notes and one for supplementation from the text .
 i had a teacher in early elementary school who taught all of us how to knit and how to spin with a drop spindle (and let us during class) .
 very effective fidget tools ,  plus you &apos;re actually making something .
 no op but i always did constrasting colors: .
 highlighter w/ pen: .
 yellow w/ purple
 green pen ,  black highlighter .
 do i have to teach you 8th grade statistics ?
 amy was talking on my tv as i read this lol
 i crammed stats this way .
 it was stupid but i passed .
 use pens of different thickness and texture .
 calligraphy ,  fine point ,  brush pens .
 i &apos;ll make you into a graphic designer yet .
 thats just science folks
  &apos;are gel pens turning your children trans ?
 lpt: can &apos;t afford to transition ?
 just write notes in different colors and become a teacher !
 the pilot hi-tec c gel pen is amazing .
 it &apos;s fabulous for spencerian script .
 it cost like $2 and makes everything i write look like a victorian love letter .
 varying degrees of importance .
 some of my teachers if something popped up on the board in red or pink chalk ,  it and everything around it &apos;s vicinity was highly important .
 importance and categories .
 either titles/explanations/summaries or types of things
 claim in one color .
 examples in another color .
 analysis in a third .
 til that people use the word brekkie in casual conversation
 might as well use fountain pens and ink bottles if she &apos;s going to change colors often .
 from now on ,  i &apos;m calling all my ee friends engelineers .
 i came into this thread thinking  &apos;ofc people use colors ,  how else can you throw a quick look over several pages and find the specific type of note you &apos;re looking for etc ?
 some people using hard to read colors ,  but still using the same color all day based on their mood that day is alien to me ,  even as someone who used to be a multicolor note taker .
 white out or correction tape doesn &apos;t exist in my office .
 single strike through and initial all mistakes .
 i trained as a physicist and learned to keep an old fashioned lab notebook (which ,  among its many uses ,  can serve as an legal document/record and must be surrendered to the university or other authorities if required) .
  in addition to the standard lab notebook rules ,  e .
 pages must be permanent and numbered (no pages could be torn out) ,  it was drilled into me that i should never ,  ever use wite-out; instead ,  i must draw a line through the mistake in such a way that the original was still legible ,  and annotate ,  initial ,  and date the mistake .
 i was quite surprised to see during grad school the number of researchers who didn &apos;t bother to keep meticulous notes or maintain a proper lab book (paper or digital) .
  i have no idea how they could be sure of their methods ,  previous work ,  settings ,  etc .
  if i were a pi ,  i would have been annoyed as fuck by such lax practices .
 i used to work for a cpa/professional auditor who advised me to keep purple pens on hand for original signatures .
 she said you &apos;ll always be able to tell at a glance if you &apos;re really the one who signed it ,  since almost no-one will have a purple pen around to fudge your signature .
 and no-one will kick up a fuss since it &apos;s basically a blue pen .
 i thought it was a silly rule until i had a co-worker take meeting notes in silver gel pen .
 you could only read it if you held it at a certain angle with the light .
 it was very pretty ,  though .
 i take my notes in red ink so everyone knows i &apos;m a bad hombre
 roll in with emerald green pens .
 just standard enough so that nobody can censure you ,  but just odd enough that it &apos;ll piss off the sticklers
 that checks out ,  since the marines would probably be eating all the different colors .
 a lot of the federal government requires black pen .
 in science lab notebooks we have to use black pen .
 charts on the other hand .
 i &apos;m a software developer and i can &apos;t stand typing notes and i insist on using ultra fine ,   .
 i just don &apos;t retain anything i type ,  ever .
 i will forget about this post as soon as i hit save .
 i went through a panic phase of trying to find a note taking strategy that worked for me .
 i just couldn’t stray from using color !
 i’m glad your wife found something that worked for her !
 where can i go to study where i can tie dye my labcoat ?
 because looking at the same white for the whole duration of the lab with everyone working monotonously is getting to me .
 yes ,  because my mind doesn &apos;t work that way .
 i &apos;ve never used multiple colors before .
 but i do think ,  if i had a system ,  it might make life easier .
 i appreciate it very much !
 show us the spreadsheet haha .
 also ,  i think this means you two are kindred spirits .
 hope the rest of your relationship is equally wholesome !
 begins chant spreadsheet !
 give us us sheet
 spreadsheet fan reporting in .
 listen to this woman/man !
 yeah there are definitely formula errors in that spreadsheet .
 then you haven &apos;t presented a sufficient project plan to the business stakeholder that adequately spells out the risk and cost of maintaining this excel sheet .
 i love spreadsheets .
  i can get them to sit up and dance through macros .
  i &apos;ve written bonafide full blown applications using vba when i &apos;ve had to out of necessity ,  but it &apos;s not my first choice .
  either it &apos;s dance card was too full and wouldn &apos;t be able to get to our demand in 6 months to a year (read 2 years to never) .
 or it wasn &apos;t going to allow a user to host their own home brew database application .
  sure ,  that &apos;s allowed .
 so say hello to my ldap ad authenticated excel application with complete user and action logging ,  synchronized off-sheet data storage ,  guided and validated user workflows ,  data access governance ,  automatic email notifications ,  and real-time reporting and visualization .
  they even supported limited multi-user access  which ,  let me tell you ,  was tricky to implement in excel !
 it shoulda given me the tools i needed .
  instead ,  i had to invent them with the ones they let me have .
 may i introduce you to mysql .
 it &apos;s free and not difficult at all .
 i would stay away from oracle since you need to pay for it and i hear it &apos;s a nightmare to work in .
 pretty much let &apos;s you query a large database super fast .
 well at least nowadays you can filter and sort by colors ,  which helps some .
 the nice things with a four color ballpoint pen is that you have all the colors in one single pen ,  takes maybe half a sec to change color to green/blue/red/black .
 by the end of my first calculus class ,  pretty much everyone (100+ students) were using them ,  just because they made taking copying the professors sketches and graphs so much easier .
 same in linear algebra ,  since so many concepts was explained as 3d pics the professor sketched - it &apos;s a lot easier to make a picture of for example two intersecting planes make sense if you can do the planes in different colors .
 i &apos;m chuckling like an mma fighter gets sparkly ,  colored pens from his trainer for note taking and strategy .
  &apos; yells the large mma fighter very excitedly .
 maybe the teachers at my school would improve their teaching methods if i force them into mma fights .
 sounds like worth a try
 hey ,  you &apos;d listen too if an mma fighter was making you take notes .
 they &apos;re all graphic designers now .
 he said he wrote with crayons ,  not that he ate the crayons .
 staring: mark anthony .
 my gel-pens they fell in to darkness .
 i was left aloooooone .
 i love the thought of the prime minister of a country furiously taking technicolor dream-notes in a cabinet meeting .
 i used to use pilot g2s ,  but i switched to pentel energel ,  5mm 0 .
 5mm needle point .
 the ink seems to flow a bit smoother than the pilots (i &apos;m left-handed so have to push rather than pull going right ,  which may contribute .
 oworder in the court !
 believe it or not ,  jail .
 i tried so many times to stop reading ,  but i was powerless .
 in this case ,  however ,  we are the victim .

 i got a used copy of the great gatsby that had every single mention of color highlighted ,  which made me go look it up ,  and turns out ,  it is an important theme in that book .
 no man ,  that &apos;s a guaranteed way to feel stupid .
 kids these days are learning this and i don &apos;t know it ?
 huh ,  the elementary school kids i work with always hand in homework that makes me want to send a note home and tell them their dealer has shit weed .
 toss everything non breakable it to various adult diaper boxes my mom got form her pharmacy .
 that &apos;s outstanding ,  in such a bad way .
 folks applying for creative/artistic/media jobs are my favorite for this reason .
 unless the application asks for a portfolio of creative work ,  please don &apos;t use your resume as a demonstration of your skillset .
 and under  &apos;special interests &apos; it just said  &apos;cheese .
 i have so many questions .
 my work is in employment compliance ,  so that would be a bad bad bad idea .
 i definitely chuckle about them though !
 it makes me wonder what they were thinking .
 when i get a stack i immediately toss half into the trash because i don’t want unlucky people working for me .
 when we are actively hiring ,  we have a legal responsibility to keep the documents on file for a few years .
  resumes collected for a specific job are kept in a dated folder and destroyed when the time comes .
 when we are not actively hiring ,  or someone is applying for a job that is definitely not open or doesn &apos;t exist ,  we do not have a legal responsibility to keep the documents .
   our company guidelines suggest a 1 year retention for the recipient ,  but it &apos;s just a guideline .
 when we get an awful resume ,  we have a good chuckle and then we file it in the appropriate place .
  usually with a politely worded sticky note on it saying  &apos;fuck no .
 thats still a lot of studying imo .
 my technique of looking at notes 5 minutes before a test probably wont work for higher level college classes though .
 bro i still use the cornell style for any notes that it would fit .
 do i have to teach you 7th grade statistics ?
 it &apos;s all folks ,  not just science ,  men are becoming women because of colored pens every .
 destroyed by facts and logic
 its big brain time
  &apos;why rainbows are making your kids gay &apos;

 0/10 ,  didn &apos;t work ,  just got insane dysphoria
 here &apos;s my problem: let &apos;s say that i tried to color code my note-taking by degree of importance .
 i feel like i would get bogged down on whether a particular entry is important enough to use the designated color ?
 do you know what i mean ?
  &apos;is this entry really worthy of red ?
 you should go to australia .
 fuckin every word is abbreviated .
 i moved to australia when i was 20 and i thought people were going to be speaking english .
 me ,   &apos;i &apos;m going to mcdonald &apos;s ,  you want me to get you a breakfast burrito ?
 shane ,   &apos;oi maccas fair dinkum mate !
 had to ruck up early for the physio and me ute was out of petrol so stopped at the servo and asked the sheila if they had brekkie but noooouaahho just lollies so ive been getting aggro &apos; .
 what the fuck shane ?
 none of the sounds that just fell out of your head were words .
 do you want a breakfast burrito or not ?
 yes ,  they &apos;re called australians .
 i do ,  in casual conversation with my dog .
 easier at that point to use a dip pen .
 with gmp compliant dating .
 i went to school for biochemistry ,  and proper lab notebook etiquette was drilled into me .
 i had classes that would spot check my lab notebooks ,  and those were part of my grade .
 i &apos;m in an entirely different line of work ,  and my notes for meetings are meticulous ,  whether hand written or typed .
 unless my grandma decides to go on a fraud spree .
 purple &apos;s her favorite color and the only color she ever writes with .
 i went to a notary who wanted to have us sign in blue ,  but the documents specifically said black ink only .
 she was surprised .
  &apos;basically a blue pen &apos; that &apos;s genius .
 pharmacists in australia use purple pens only .
 - no other health professionals can  (should) use them .
 i’m an attorney and after having a new hire with the firm send out letters in other attorneys names i switched to a custom blend of green and blue ink for my signature .
 it looked like regular dark blue ink at first glance but if you looked at it under light you could tell a slight turquoise tint to it .
 pens aren &apos;t made of delicious wax though ?
 they eat crayons and use post it notes to remind themselves of which crayons to eat on which day .
 i don &apos;t work for the us government ,  but the government i do work for prefers blue pens ,  because it helps differentiate original paperwork from copies .
 it &apos;s not an actual ban on other colors ,  though .
 she now carries a rainbow of g2s in her scrubs .
 with a pocket protector of course .
 she &apos;s still the nerdy girl she was in high school and i love it
 anywhere ,  just say you had a rainbow incident in the lab and refuse to answer any follow-up questions
 i have to find my old notes and system sheet so it may take a while but i &apos;ll let you know what it is as soon as i find it :)
 i write in cursive and it looks good ,  but my print is ass cheeks .
 it looks like someone just learning letters other than g ,  h ,  and q
 the chicken scratch of a dying man with dementia .
 at least it &apos;s not a dying doctor with dementia !
 we want the sheet
 it really says something about ms access that excel is a more feature-complete database kludge than is access .
 oracle owns mysql .
 depending on how your company plans on using it ,  it could be free or you have to pay out of your ass .
 a truly free alternative is mariadb .
 it &apos;s a fork of mysql and maintained by some of the original developers of mysql ,  after that soulless shit corporation oracle bought it .
 you can’t write formulas against colors though .
 he’s not even the it departments worse nightmare .
 he’s anyone’s worts nightmare that need to do any sort of analysis  on the data .
  &apos;why are you using a pink pen for striking strategy ?
  &apos;it &apos;s my power colour !
 octavian disliked that

 it &apos;s also a comment that &apos;s a bit hard to miss considering the number of awards it has .

 nothing else like meeting your lawyer to discuss your court case just to see her pupils slowly turn into the scary shape of hearts and then get corrupted by her overwhelming .
 when you &apos;ve finally came to ,  you &apos;re no longer normie and you ask her for the watch order of fate while handholding her soft delicate hands .

 we need to recall all of our deep space probes so that we can engrave this on them .
  we need the aliens to understand what they &apos;re getting into .

 house of leaves comes pre-highlighted .
 my parents let me play with my parakeet while doing my homework .
 he liked to sit on the end of my pencil .
 it was revolting thing to do and my school made my parents make me stop .
 i guess the neighbours immediately know not to mess with a person that moves in with 50 boxes of adult diapers and a backpack .
 did anyone ever send you their resume in a box with a shoe in it ?
 and a note saying  &apos;just want to get my foot in the door .
 back in the early 1990s ,  this was common career advice .
  and it worked back then ,  in my experience .
  machine readability wasn &apos;t a concern ,   either ,   so formatting was focused on eye appeal and standing out ,  while still looking professional .
  it was a form of personal branding .
 so probably you &apos;re dealing with a candidate who is following antiquated advice - either an older person or someone whose parents are offering advice based on what worked for them last time .
 let &apos;s rephrase: have you ever hired anyone because of this ?
 i know you’re (probably) joking but do you shuffle them first or do they appear in the order that people applied in ?
 if you &apos;re the unlucky one that could backfire
 they were a game changer for me !
 my apush teacher required the class to do them for a grade on each unit .
 i absolutely love the cornell style .
 i’m forever grateful to that teacher for showing them to me
 now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  i need to leave a snide voicemail about kindergarten statistics .
 ahh that explains the lgbt flag

 bold of you to assume i &apos;m good enough at taking notes for that to be anywhere near my biggest worry .
 and every singly crossing through needs a reason ,  even if you obviously just wrote the letters the wrong way around ,  needs reason: spelling error 
 makes me think of the poem warning ,  by jenny joseph:  .
    when i am an old woman i shall wear purple .
    with a red hat which doesn’t go ,  and doesn’t suit me .
    and i shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves .
    and satin sandals ,  and say we’ve no money for butter .
    i shall sit down on the pavement when i’m tired .
    and gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells .
    and run my stick along the public railings .
    and make up for the sobriety of my youth .
    i shall go out in my slippers in the rain .
    and pick flowers in other people’s gardens .
    and learn to spit .
    you can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat .
    and eat three pounds of sausages at a go .
    or only bread and pickle for a week .
    and hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes .
    but now we must have clothes that keep us dry .
    and pay our rent and not swear in the street .
    and set a good example for the children .
    we must have friends to dinner and read the papers .
    but maybe i ought to practise a little now ?
    so people who know me are not too shocked and surprised .
    when suddenly i am old ,  and start to wear purple .
 when it comes to choosing ink colour i hear my articling supervisor telling me to always use blue ink because that way it &apos;s easier to tell at a glance if a document is an original or a photocopy
 so the military has a hard-on for black ink .
  i worked with people that the mere sight of blue pen would cause great distress .
  some forms even says  &apos;black ink only &apos; .
 i was working for an old crusty officer who was former enlisted .
  he was getting ready to sign something in blue ink .
  i politely informed him ,   &apos;sir ,  that pen is blue &apos; .
   he laughed and gave me the  &apos;rest of the story &apos; paul harvey style .
  allegedly ,  the first generation copy machines could only  &apos;see &apos; black .
  if you filled out a form in blue and copied it ,  you got a blank form as the output .
  he then said this hasn &apos;t been a problem since like 1975 ,  but we still say black ink only .
  we &apos;re just monkeys repeating what we &apos;ve been told .
 okay ,  but what about the gold plated holographic rare blurple pens ?
 i’ve never seen this (never noticed this ?
 i’m going to go to the pharmacy tomorrow and observe the pens .
 as if a marine could tell the difference
 and make up and sign your own nda stating you can &apos;t talk about it .
 that way you &apos;re not actually lying when you say the nda you signed doesn &apos;t let you talk about it .
 technically ,  dyeing clothes is a chemical reaction .
 write a book on your system after explaining it to us .
 of course only if you &apos;re into writing as much as you &apos;re into colouring .
 keep it as a side job/hobby .
 i &apos;m at my day job ,  so this is a discreet operation !
 thankfully ,  no one questions spreadsheets
 and even then it wouldn &apos;t let publish as access db .
  i &apos;d be allowed to keep a local one  &apos;if i absolutely needed it &apos; but would be against policy to have it somewhere where other people could access it .

 he sat and he stared at the screen with a sigh -   .
 a hitch in his chest and a tear in his eye -   .
 a feeling that lingered -   .
 a longing to go -   .
 a notion ,  emotion of sadness and woe .
 he sat and he stared and he felt it within -   .
 the rising of terror ,    .
 the sickness of sin -   .
 the panic ,  the loathing ,  the hatred ,  the dread -   .
 the endless abundance of horror ahead .
 he sat and he stared till he knew it was true -   .
  &apos;twas never as heinous a vision to view -   .
  &apos;twas never a comment so filled with dismay .
  &apos;it &apos;s dreadful ,  &apos; he whispered .
 i can &apos;t look away .

 well turn your phone sideways then ,  no excuses !
 it was absolutely common then .
 it reminds me of the business card monologues in american psycho ,  and we just don &apos;t worry about that kind of thing anymore .
 machine readability and keywords are way more important in today &apos;s hiring market .
 i have not ,  but i am not the person who decides who to hire .
 i look out for trends of discrimination ,  implicit bias ,  pay inequity ,  etc .
 both in the specific file and also in long-term organizational trends ,  and i approve their hiring requests if they appear to be ok .
 if the departments want to hire the person who submitted a rose-scented resume on glittery pink paper ,  who am i to judge ?
 this is a really old joke ,  like pre-internet old .
 my installers at my current job hate me (not really) .
 i enforce the gmp compliance because i refuse to be held responsible for failing an audit .
 had one guy refuse to fix it .
 all i had to say to his boss was that if they weren &apos;t going to fix it ,  i had to send it to pn (global compliance officer that everyone is terrified of) .
  wouldn &apos;t you know i had the corrected document 10 minutes later .
 that was nice thanks !
 my mum loves this poem .
 it hurts that this is the first time i &apos;ve read it and felt it resonate ,  probably because i &apos;m now in my thirties and have caved under the pressure to be a  &apos;proper adult .
 isn’t this where the red hat society came from ?
 (also ,  i love the red hat ladies in my town ,  they’re a goddam hoot .
 yeah ,  in college i worked at a hobby lobby for a few years (before they got too super weird) .
 at this time ,  the red hat ladies ,  stemming from this poem ,  were a thing .
 to be a member ,  you had to be over 65 .
 if you were between 55 and 65 ,  you could be in the pink hat society ,  like a junior league .
 older ones had red and purple everything .
 juniors got pink and lavender .
 scrapbooking was all the rage then ,  among the suburban set ,  and they had stickers ,  3d stickers ,  all that paraphernalia .
 and these ladies ,  as one big entity ,  were insane .
 they begat the “can i speak to your manager” karen .
 maybe today’s karen evolved from the red hats .
 maybe they walked to she could run .
 either way ,  i hated and dreaded when “red hat society” showed up on the sale list .
 there were certain branded items that would be on sale ,  very specifically with their official branding sticker on it or whatever ,  but these old bats would figure anything that was red and purple was now on sale .
 candles not even affiliated ?
 random pottery thing on the other side of the store ?
 the entire valentines aisle (typically red and pink) ?
 on sale ,  duh (and not for the valentines sale) .
 and god help you if you weren’t as excited about ringing up the 150 different sheets of fucking stickers that lined the bottom of their basket ,  half of which contained other sticker sheets that did not have the red hat branding on it .
 at that time (and to a degree ,  it’s still like this) ,  hobby lobby didn’t have scanners for ringing up merchandise (something something saved money) .
 so you’d have to basically have the store memorized ,  know by heart what’s on sale or not ,  and then manually punch in the price of every thing .
 including the 150 sheets of fucking stickers .
 at my particular store ,  the manager was a great guy ,  my colleagues were a wonderful bunch ,  and not in that fake weird christian way that chik-fil-a is ,  we were just a good group .
 we could just run issues up the chain to him pretty quickly ,  before they’d try to stab us with their knitting needles .
 but holy hell did i hate red hat sale week .
 tl;dr: the red hat poem gave me flashbacks to my time being berated by venomous little old ladies as a cashier at hobby lobby .
 i’ve got other hobby lobby stories too .
 it was a fun time .
 this was one of my mom’s favourite poems .
 i love it ,  thanks for posting it .
 also protip ,  if a document is meant to stay in your office/won &apos;t be seen by a client ,  you can write an identifying mark or note in yellow neon highlighter and it won &apos;t show up in black and white photocopies .
 you have to get to level 5 to even be able to see blurple .
 that takes years .
 it &apos;s hospital pharmacists as far as i can tell .
 i &apos;ve worked in a few retail pharmacies in aus and never seen them use purple pens .
 i was disbarred but now i &apos;m a lawyer in another world !

 yes sorry - to clarify this is for clinical pharmacists in hospitals .
 sounds like the name for a new hit anime .
 thanks kind redditor for the gold ,  although i dont know what to do with it
 congratulations ,  you &apos;ve now replaced the obligatory  &apos;fresh sprog &apos; post with something worse .
 are you fucking sorry ?
 “fresh sprog” is just reddit version of posting “first”
 i don &apos;t appreciate ,  no ,  being called out so ,  whilst i am simply a random passer-by .
 i &apos;ve never seen you so territorial ,  sprog .
 i &apos;ll show that crank what &apos;s what .
 that was also nice !
 i &apos;m gonna break a leg so i can see this for myself brb
 egypt and ethiopia are close to going to war due to ethiopia building a dam on the nile river .
 ethiopia is diverting some water and limiting water flow to egypt .

 does ethiopia have the military strength to take on egypt ?
 i don’t know much about ethiopian military but egypt gets over a billion dollars a year in military aid from the usa and have the largest standing army on the continent ?
 wow this got a lot of attention .
 to clarify i was talking hypothetically .
 as some good commenters have pointed out an actual ground conflict between the two seems unlikely as egypt would have to either get the permission of sudan and s .
 sudan to move troops through their nations or would have to invade them as well .
 thanks for all the great responses !
 egypt &apos;s biggest asset is the suez canal .

 probably a dumb question ,  but where do comets come from ?
 where are they going ?
 jesus had to scroll down for an hour to find some good news .
 thanks for letting us know !
 more apocolyptic symbols !
 hey ,  i hope this is okay to ask here ,  i dont come across an astronomer every day lol .
 so the last few days i have noticed a really bright planet rising in the west after sunset .
 skystracker says it &apos;s venus ,  but i have never seen it so bright !
 might it be due to reduced pollution ?
 i live in a large city in the us .
 plagues ,  wild fires ,  locust  .
 i know things like this happen but definitely getting some apocalypse vibes
 i thought you were joking .
 this is unreal .
 what’s next ,  frogs ?
 um ,  just one horseman at a time please
 earn it is only on the table because of covid-19 .
 there’s no way they would try this if we weren’t distracted .
 it &apos;s amazing to me .
 the simple fact that this is impossible to implement .
  but that &apos;s not enough to stop them .
  it &apos;s one of the most disruptive acts i have ever seen .
  bunch of old dumb people making rules without even remotely understanding the implications .
 am i the only one who sees earn it as the obvious follow up to the death of net neutrality ?
  &apos;oh we can take this and nobody can stop us ?
 well ,  let &apos;s take it a step further !
 still actively following this one ,  and was my response to the first time this question was asked .
 did you see she reportedly thought the kids were zombies ?
 this whole case infuriated me .
 still following this one .
 so sad about the gannon stauch case ,  i was following that one pretty closely since it was a kid in my friends neighborhood .
 i half wonder if she didn &apos;t shove that poor girl into one of the geysers in yellowstone .
 we &apos;re still getting decent coverage here in boise ,  but i can imagine not elsewhere .
 related: evelyn boswell’s remains were found and her mother remains in jail on false reporting charges ,  but still no charges in the death .
 hopefully they’re working hard to build a solid case .
 i work in the oil industry .
  this is huge right now .
  its honestly just about the same as the coronavirus for us .
 hours getting cuts people losing their jobs etc .
 all due to oil price and not coronavirus .
 us shale is paying the price .
   even without the virus ,  it would kill our economy .
 yes ,  it did start before coronavirus ,  but the impact happened at the same time .
 i &apos;d argue right now that if covid wasn &apos;t happening - neither would the oil price war .
 they can only drop the price of oil super cheap because demand dropped through the floor .
 i think we &apos;ve all known for awhile that dude &apos;s going to leave power in a casket and not a moment sooner .
 to be honest i &apos;m not so much afraid of putin being in power longer ,  i &apos;m more afraid of when he finally kicks the bucket and leaves a power vacuum behind .
 i &apos;m not a fan of the man myself but he &apos;s better than a warmonger arrising and creating the cold war part 2
 there is actualy public vote about it in russia that has been postponed becouse of corona
 - afghan officials say 25 were killed and  .
 eight more are wounded in an attack on the sikh temple in the nation &apos;s capital .
 - it appears multiple gunmen stormed the temple complex while there were approximately 150 people inside .
 - a sikh who took cover says the militants went room to room ,  shooting and throwing hand grenades .
 - the islamic state organization has claimed responsibility
 aw man ,  bombing the sikhs ?
 i know it &apos;s isis ,  but c &apos;mon guys
 yes ,  but wasn &apos;t this precipitated by covid-19 ?
  or is there another scandal i &apos;m not aware of ?
 its fucking disgraceful .
  politicians shouldn &apos;t be allowed to own stock .
  i mean this is blatant but it makes you wonder how many more subtle buy and sells were done on privy information .
  a few people talking about blind trusts ,  that’s probably better than not owning stocks .
  assuming they don’t get to choose when to buy and sell ?
 even weinstein getting coronavirus barely seemed to be a blip on the news radar .
 weinstein was confirmed to have the coronavirus ,  were you talking about that or his sentencing ?
 weinstein was in the news .
 for testing positive for coronavirus ;)
 and also bans end-to-end encryption ,  if you know anything about internet security you know that would be devastating to literally everything that &apos;s based online in any way whatsoever
 they pulled it off successfully with the patriot act against terrorists ,  so why not do it with pedophiles ,  despite immunity being granted to the rich ones ?
 wait ,  the name of the bill doesn’t actually tell you what it is ?
 it also ruins encryption and basically sacrifices the foundation the internet is built on
 there’s gonna be a very large amount of lawsuits over this seeing as it violates the constitution
 saw it on bbc news top stories this morning ,  then was quickly pushed down the order
 well that’s just messed up .
  big fan of that app too .
 technically that happened a long time ago .
 he’s still cured (as was expected) like 3 years later .
 he was cured in very much the same way cutting somebodies leg of cures athletes foot .
 the procedure is waaay more dangerous than having hiv ,  and the curing was just a side effect of the cancer treatment .
 its hitting pakistan too ,  and china is prepping to send 700 , 000 ducks to stop the locusts .
 easy to control ,  and one duck can eat 200 locusts a day
 i have seen it in the news i don &apos;t know how bad it is but it doesn’t look good
 don &apos;t locust storms happen relatively often in certain parts of africa ?
 government:  &apos;time to start taking more civil liberties from our people !
 has something recent happened on this front ?
 i can &apos;t seem of find anything about it
 i hate to hear this
 seriously ,  who the fuck is going to win ?
 so ,  does the pandemic help republicans or democrats ?
 never thought i &apos;d be thankful for a pandemic !
 the money that went to reputable organisations will still be handed out for awhile .
 those orgs know that the need lasts a lot longer than the news spotlight and public attention .
 even worse for the tourist towns that are now not getting any traffic over easter and likely until at least summer .
 one of my family members is involved with the red cross .
 it’s taking a while to give the money to the ones in need as they are shuffling through thousands and thousands of applications  daily and a lot of them are scammers trying to get free money ,  so trying to decipher that is what is hard .
 they’ve helped a fair amount of people but it’s just taking a while .
 all the workers have been trying their hardest .
 shame media portrays such a bad picture of their efforts .
 its fucking stupid .
 what i’ve heard is that companies that continue to use end-to-end encryption will be stripped of their section 230 protections (they will then be responsible for any illegal shit found on their platform) which will really fuck up every social networking platform because there’s gonna be illegal shit on there .
 companies that comply and remove their e2e encryption will keep their section 230 protections but essentially open up their platform to a host of security vulnerabilities .
 as a cybersecurity enthusiast ,  i should point out that a ton of its supporters seem very uninformed on the benefits of e2e encryption .
 it’s a stupid idea .
 for those wondering why the government is even considering this ,  its because the bill supporters claim it will “bring child predators to justice .
 ” it’s a stupid idea that won’t work and i honestly don’t see how anyone with the slightest bit of clarity could think otherwise .
 wouldn &apos;t this kill online banking ?
 this is just like stupid old politicians demanding apple add a backdoor to iphones .
  &apos;we promise we &apos;ll keep the keys safe !
 encryption can be used for bad things ,  but that applies to literally anything .
 call me stupid but would this affect anyone outside of america ?
 i work in cybersecurity and this is literally one of the dumbest things you can do for your economy .
 every large company is expected to encrypt any data that is personal ,  confidential ,  financial ,  employment ,  and the list goes on and on .
 they will refuse to work with other countries ,  they will refuse to offer lots of online services such as banking .
 most jobs that are work from home right now due to covid require vpn and in-transit encryption ,  so that would go away and bring up unemployment another 10-15% .
 hell ,  under ccpa regulations in california you are legally compelled to use in-transit encryption .
 it’s absolutely inane to believe you can ban that and expect all to be well and dandy .
 what is the argument for this ?
 i’ve only seen people say why it is bad .
 if it’s so bad ,  what are the politicians saying to make it seem good ?
 the chinese government is getting more heavy handed now that everyone &apos;s attention is focused elsewhere .
 hey ,  nobody can say he doesn &apos;t embody florida though .
 better than a subtle dosing male escort i suppose
 wow ,  that sounds like a south park episode .
 azerbaijan ,  turkmenistan ,  kazakhstan ,  uzbekistan: “it took you this long ?
 i couldn &apos;t find any news about zelensky or anyone else extending their term .
 can you share a link ?
 don’t spread misinformation .
 where is the sources that zelensky is trying to do this ?
 putin you read about everyday in the news ,  but haven’t seen this information about ukraine .
 sad days for an irish man  ,  i feel sorry for you  .
 i know what you feel like mate ,  here in bavaria (the place with the oktoberfest) the beergardens are closed .
 the pubs were closed for paddy’s day .
 if that doesn’t hammer home how serious this situation is ,  not much else will !
 it &apos;s even crazier to know that there are ones that &apos;ve been open for hundreds of years ,  and might even have stayed open for both world wars ,  besides all the others .
 im moving straight away
 the pandemic really covered up the global warming effects .
 not to mention the human effects on the planet .
 this will bite back worse than the pandemic ,  just a thought .
 so did kanye actually ask her permission and taylor was bsing or was it the other way around ?
 thats not news ,  its always been like that .
 prince charles is isolating in balmoral with covid-19 .
 andrew is isolating in windsor with rebecca ,  14 .
 my sister has been living in the uk and i was visiting like a year ago ?
 before it all came out and we saw a random standup comedy making jokes about that ,  what i &apos;m saying is the public (in the uk at least) pretty much knew he was a shady creep .
 we have a play house outside in our backyard and my little brother left his elmo doll in the play house during a storm .
 the play house flooded and elmo was submerged so we had to go on a rescue mission to get him .
 2036 actually ,  or at least that &apos;s what somebody else said .
 what &apos;s going on in south america ?
 and getting coronavirus !
 didn’t know a lot of his sons .
 but i did like coward of the county .
 i’m not illiterate .
 also the petition to get pornhub criminally investigated for hosting rape and underage content reached 500 , 000 signatures .
 i’ll get downvoted for saying it but it was being talked about before all this hit and would probably be talked about now if it hadn’t .
 \shrugs\ a lot of old folks retire in florida .
 i guess it makes sense .
 i had a similar experience .
 we were taught that so far we haven &apos;t found any planet besides earth that &apos;s capable of sustaining carbon-based life so therefore aliens don &apos;t exist .
 given the presence of that qualifier ,  i thought it was pretty obvious to ask about non-carbon-based life .
 but nobody took my question seriously .
 nah ,  egypt is second strongest arab nation .
 its arab nation not arabic  .
 i gotta stop scrolling reddit after 2am
 but most of the ships don &apos;t belong to ethiopia .
 if egypt stopped letting ,  say ,  chinese or greek ships through because they had cargo from there ,  the world would be up in arms over restraint of trade .
 do these things actually do anything ?
 much easier for him to tell which direction is upstream now .
 pardon my lack of knowledge ,  but for those of us uneducated folks what &apos;s crispr ?
 and how is it doing this .
 it &apos;s been getting better and better for years .
 since the ban of cfc &apos;s to be precise .
 this would not be news even without covid19 .
 important side note: the ozone layer has nothing to do with the greenhouse gases layer .
 to quickly distinguish between the two ,  the ozone layer filters out harmful uv rays ,  and is necessary for life as we know to exist on earth ,  this was being destroyed by cfc &apos;s however since the ban of ,  it has been slowly replenishing;    .
 the greenhouse gases layer is mainly made of co2 ,  the one of the main products of combustion (aka burning) ,  thickening this layer causes global warming (averagewise) which causes climate change ,  erratic weather patterns ,  and extreme weather events .
 this layer is still getting thicker
 don’t leave the doorframe !
 it &apos;s very likely that the corona quarantine helped the death toll to be lower than it would be in usual circumstances .
 there was a church where the ceiling fell off almost entirely and it being on sunday morning it would likely already start to fill up with people then .
 it also knocked out a bunch of hospitals ,  right in the middle of corona .
 a 15 year old girl died .
 yeah ,  the people that get out there to treat patients are some of the world’s biggest heroes .
 i can’t imagine how scary is must be to be living in a place with an ebola outbreak going on .
 thank god it’s all over now .
 that was the last bit of positive news i got before all this started happening .
 currently ,  the youngest known case is 9 years old .
 someone said that was the number of views where as the actual number of people was 10k to 30k .
 that &apos;s still hellish and i still want to do something about it but i do prefer factual numbers even when it &apos;s messed up stuff .
 i don &apos;t want to lose more faith in my fellow man
 a very eerie detail i read in one article is how in search engines popular in south korea such as naver ,  there was a sudden peak in people browsing how to delete the type of account required to join to rooms without leaving any tracks .
 sorry for my language but some people are fucking disgusting pigs
 yeah it &apos;s terrifying looking at how many members are involved .
 it &apos;s really horrible stuff .
 like seriously ,  nightmares are made of some of the things that these inhuman assholes forced young girls to do to themselves .
 the  &apos;man &apos; man is apparently still yet to be identified or caught though they have some leads .
 seriously scary stuff .
 because they can &apos;t technically  &apos;ban &apos; encryption .
 they could probably force app store owners (google ,  apple) to not allow apps that use it ,  but they cannot  &apos;ban &apos; the technology .
 well ,  yes insane ,  but also completely clueless when it comes to technology
 real talk ,  they likely knew about this for a long time ,  and were waiting to find a time to close it .
 this is the best time to do a lot of infrastructure maintenance .
 other than groceries and deliveries ,  i haven &apos;t seen many people out .
 people are still going for walks/jogs ,  but we &apos;re giving each other massive space .
 friend of mine works in accounting and he said his company is planning on seeing a massive spike in fraud with all the bankruptcies expected to occur .
 people tryna sneak under the radar so to speak
 in spain here - tldr .
 this originated in 2001-2 when saudi arabia donated 100 mill to the king ,  and there was suspicion of it being a bribe related to construction of high speed rail there (suspected by spanish intelligence services) .
 it went to tribunals but tribunals ruled there was no evidence it was a bribe .
 since then the king abdicated (2014) ,  new evidence came up (that tied past king to a company offshore) ,  and it &apos;s gone to trial again (past wife of juan carlos brought evidence forth in a divorce case then in appeared in a newspaper) .
 for what it &apos;s worth felipe (the current king) has renounced his inheritance (unsure if all of it or just the 100 mill from that company) and made it so the old king does not get paid anymore by taxpayer money (paid close to 200k yearly before) .
 e: juan carlos &apos;s lawyers defend the 100mill was a gift without any  &apos;quid pro quo &apos; - because of course they do .
 e2: checked a couple sources ,  felipe renounced to all his inheritance from his father
 don &apos;t you mean  &apos;spanish courts refuse to open an inquisition .
 spanish here ,   never knew that .
  thanks ,   another reason why we dont need a king in spain .
 he took a bribe from saudi arabia when spain was building a trainline from meca to medina
 i am indian ,  and i can confirm that the british take ages to leave .
 well yes ,  but no .
 we have officially left ,  but there is one year under current eu regs ,  etc as new trade deals and all the rest of it are thrashed out .
 i &apos;d guess that will be extended now .
 we’re right now in a one year “transitional” period ,  where our future terms with the eu need to be ironed out ,  otherwise we properly leave in jan 2021 trading only on wto rules (bad idea) .
 of course ,  the transitional period could be extended ,  but boris has maintained he won’t extend it .
 he did however ,  say he would “rather die in a ditch” instead of extending the leave date past oct 31st 2019 ,  and yet he’s still alive .
 dude me too and i &apos;ve never been this hyped over a comet .
 this will be the first time i &apos;ve seen one apart from meteors .
 nope ,  it &apos;s definitely venus !
  it &apos;s actually at peak brightness right now- you may have not seen it before because it has a multi-year cycle and doesn &apos;t often get this high and bright .
 don &apos;t forget the major earthquakes .
 as someone interested in spirituality and ancient philosophies i just want to offer a different take on this whole thing .
 the modern take on the apocalypse is  &apos;everything goes to shit &apos; which is not what the original definition meant .
 the word apocalypse literally means  &apos;unveiling &apos; ,  and i think that even though we are seeing a quick short term decline ,  after these trials are over we could very well see humanity rebound from the suffering and leave this age of confusion ,  hypocrisy ,  lies ,  anger ,  and authoritarianism ,  and enter an age of truth ,  love ,  light ,  compassion ,  and understanding .
 after the black plague ,  europe saw the death of feudalism and the birth of a free peasantry ,  and eventually the renaissance .
 very good things can happen after very hard and painful things have happened .
 this has shown to be the case countless times in history .
 and this will not be anywhere near that bad as far as disease outbreaks go .
 if it &apos;s any consolation ,  i &apos;m saying this as a person with a degree in biology .
 i &apos;m not trying to spout superstition ,  but to instead spread an outlook that i feel is extremely valuable in today &apos;s day and age .
 i was walking in the late evening along a storm drainage lake near my house .
  the ground was covered with thousands of small frogs .
  so i suggest anyone who &apos;s a first born buy some mutton and smear the blood over your door .
 or if you have kids .
 that &apos;s not how the apocalypse works
 that &apos;s a fair point of view .
  maybe another good /r/askreddit thread could be what are people trying to sneak by with all of our attention elsewhere .
 i thought the same about when they were trying to make changes to cookie policies and back when coppa was passed:  &apos;this can &apos;t happen ,  it just doesn &apos;t work the way they would expect it to &apos; .
  but here we are .
 thank you for the lengthy write up ,  which actually explains more than just  &apos;convoluted case ,  look it up &apos; others have been commenting without providing any links .
 after her arrest ,  bail was set at $1 million .
 she &apos;s got the 10% needed for up-front costs to bond out but none of the bail bondsmen want to accept their money to come post bail on her behalf .
 one of the bail bondsmen (bondswoman) said she would post bail if lori showed some tiny proof of life for the kids .
 needless to say ,  bail was never posted and she &apos;s still locked up .
 i have a lot of sympathy for criminals and inmates .
 i &apos;ve been arrested numerous times ,  served time in federal prison ,  and have met a lot of people along the way .
 a lot of these people have made simple mistakes ,  were part of nonviolent/victimless crimes/have severe mental health issues .
 but i &apos;ve got no sympathy for someone like lori .
 kids are innocent and there &apos;s no reason for anything like this to ever happen .
 whenever i hear about her case i sometimes wish women &apos;s prisons were as violent as men &apos;s prisons can be .
 this sounds like it’s gonna be on netflix
 an that she bought her wedding ring with charles vallow &apos;s amazon account 17 days before tammy daybell &apos;s death .
 she was here on kauai hiding out for a while .
 but everyone on the island was rude to them because we didn &apos;t want them .
  &apos;where is the kids &apos; they &apos;d get asked everywhere they went .
 i haven &apos;t been keeping up since they left kauai though .
 have they found the kids at all or at least what happened to them ?
 i hate to ask ,  but what happened ?
 that &apos;s likely it .
 there &apos;s got to be a good reason why the fbi is asking for information about that yellowstone trip with tylee .
 yeah not at all .
 the company will be perfectly fine without him ,  and i &apos;m certain they will always listen if he comes back .
 if anything ,  it shows he feels the company is in great hands and that he can walk away .
 i mean he could go the north korea route having him as supream leader for ever and the person running the country just be like the prime minister
 to be fair there really hasn &apos;t been a many times in russian history when they weren &apos;t a borderline or straight up dictatorship and or authoritarian regime .
 business as usual for them .
 fucking assholes are at it again .
 most sikhs are literally the nicest people .
 they have being kind built in to the religion and have rocking beards and turbans .
 ok so not all sikhs are nice .
 that &apos;s a given .
 stop being so angry please
 this and the oil  &apos;war &apos; are both reactions to the coronavirus .
 neither would &apos;ve been likely to occur at this precise time in the virus &apos; absence ,  but the underlying issue would &apos;ve likely occurred later on .
 they should probably have to have a blind trust
 /r/conspiracy  thinks he doesn &apos;t have it and he is going to  &apos;die &apos; and get a bunch of plastic surgery and escape to europe or something .
 hope he survives so he can rot in jail instead of getting the easy way out
 because nobody believes it .
  in a few weeks we &apos;ll hear that he died from it .
  yeah fucking right .
 i definitely heard about his sentencing .
 nobody would be allowed to use end to end encryption ?
 more common than you think .
 how do you pass really shitty legislation that’s basically nothing more than a power grab ?
 give it a wonderful sounding name like anti child porn law or the patriot act .
 then come out and say: this bill intends this or intends to achieve that .
 don’t talk about what the actual bill is or says ,  only what the intentions are and make it sound wonderful .
 third step is when someone argues against it you say what you hate children ?
 you don’t want to stop child porn ?
 you don’t like patriotism ?
 don’t you want to get rid of terrorists and feel safe ?
 whenever you hear a politician talking about intentions be very skeptical and it’s probably a good idea to find out what the legislation actually says .
 wow thank you for the silver and all the responses ,  this really blew up more than i expected ,  even though i haven’t responded i agree with many comments .
 between this ,  eu &apos;s article 13 ,  and china &apos;s sesame credit .
 well ,  we had a good run i suppose .
 goodbye ,  free internet :(
 so did the patriot act .
 that was almost 20 years ago .
 no one has done anything about it .
 article 1 for the lazy .
  &apos;seoul ,  march 23 (yonhap) -- more than 2 million people have signed an online petition as of monday demanding the government unveil the identity of a man who allegedly ran a group chat room where photos and videos of violent sex acts ,  involving underaged victims ,  were distributed .
 at least 74 victims are known to have been exploited in the so-called nth room case ,  in which a man surnamed cho allegedly lured victims into taking naked photos and later threatened and exploited them into more gruesome sex acts .
 cho ,  who used the nickname  &apos;baksa ,  &apos; which means  &apos;doctor &apos; or  &apos;guru &apos; in korean ,  is accused of distributing the videos in a group chat room on the messaging service telegram ,  where at least 10 , 000 users are suspected of paying cho to watch the videos .
 police have so far tracked down 124 people in relation to the case ,  including cho and 17 others who have been formally detained .
 the user who is suspected of first creating the chat room ,  however ,  still remains at large .
 so it &apos;s epstein and his blackmail material friends all over again ?
 what is it with the rich creeping on kids ?
 the part about 260k member messed me up .
 just how many people had came across the telegram groups but did not sound any alarm .
 you are indeed correct .
 the radio show i was listening to was just talking about it at great length as if it just happened ,  so i figured it was recent .
 he was cured of hiv .
  he &apos;s still cured of hiv ,  but he was cured of hiv too .
 d u c k f o r c e
 i need to see the source for this .
 3 as there are  wars going on right now .
 okay i should have mentioned that i also count in economic wars .
 i kid you not ,  but 2 days ago i had a really shitty dream where that entire qoute about the rider on a pale hours kept repeating itself while dreaming the most fucked up scenarios nd i woke up in cold sweats .
 i &apos;m not even religious but that one messed me up for a day or so .
 tbf all 4 horsemen have been around for most of human history in much greater numbers until recently .
 people died of disease ,  famine ,  and war in much higher rates 100 years ago ,  or even 2000 years ago ,  when the four horsemen were invented
 i think it &apos;s like every 17-20 years .
 never let a good crisis go to waste
 i was thinking last night ,  because i was reading about how south korea got downright draconian there for a couple of weeks .
  and most importantly ,  they gave the liberties back .
 it would be a lot easier to trust the government to take drastic action in times of crisis if you didn &apos;t just fucking know they were never giving that shit back .
  maybe if we weren &apos;t on year 19 of the god damn patriot act ,  with the tsa still fondling children and stealing things ,  it &apos;d be a little easier to welcome the idea of some strict controls to help in times of crisis .
 but when the government has decided that  &apos;forever &apos; is a time of crisis for the purpose of them fucking you over ,  then it &apos;s more difficult to trust them .
 it &apos;s called the earn it act for easier googling .
 i really thought trump was gonna win easily ,  but now with all this stuff who knows what’s gonna happen .
 economy turned to shit plus who knows how many people are gonna be dead in the next couple months .
 wonder if the blue collar will turn their back on trump
  trump is immune to public opinion so this just gives less time for biden to dig himself a hole .
 this comment &apos;s going to age real well .
 they want them open to security vulnerabilities so its easier for the government to secretly take data from them .
 banking is completely untenable without proper encryption .
 it would kill online commerce .
  it would kill people working remotely that need to access their private work network .
 it would never happen because it makes no sense and would be impossible to enforce .
 it very likely would in some way at least since many tech companies are based in the united states
 i think that means he &apos;s not florida enough .
 they needed way more wild animals in their sexcapades .
 the meth just wasn &apos;t enough .
  &apos;you guys are having elections ?
 zelensky isn’t making equivalent moves to putin
 i think he &apos;s referring to yanukovych and is misinformed or copy pasted wrong or something .
 zelensky is decreasing in popularity but not for anything like trying to set in place indefinite term limits .
 fellow bavarian here .
 i &apos;m coming up on my 2nd week without physical or even emotional contact .
 i just sit at home .
 be depressed at home .
 i haven &apos;t had a beer in 2 weeks .
 i don &apos;t even feel like it .
 what i wouldn &apos;t give for a day in the sun with good friends and a few cold ones now .
 maybe a nice lake view .
 instead i &apos;ve been staring at a computer screen for 17 to 18 hours a day ,  can &apos;t really sleep and bury my head in work when i can .
 and we &apos;re looking at another 3 weeks minimum .
 and then probably at another 4 to 8 weeks of  &apos;don &apos;t meet anybody who doesn &apos;t live in your household and keep a safe distance &apos; and i &apos;m like  &apos;sure ,  i live alone ,  woopdifuckingdoo &apos; :(   .
 oktoberfest pretty much has to be cancelled this year .
 no way that can take place .
 millions of drunk people ,  close together .
 the maßen alone will be contaminated ,  let alone the beer .
 and so many tourists .
 if there &apos;s even going to be flights available ,  because those are another big risk factor .
 it would be a heavy blow for munich .
 just as bars and pubs will have to stay mainly closed throughout the year i assume .
 unless someone comes up with a miracle drug or master plan .
 but the best i &apos;ve seen is either extreme social distancing until there is a vaccine or a continuous cycle of re-infection ,  shutdown ,  reinfection ,  shutdown - .
 what happens to earth if all countries follow the italy shutdown ?
 didn’t china’s air start to get a little better since there wasn’t billions of people driving about ?
 in the phone call kanye &apos;s proposed lyric is  &apos;i feel like taylor swift might owe me sex &apos; .
 the actual lyric is  &apos;i feel like me and taylor might still have sex .
 i made that bitch famous .
  &apos; taylor is clearly uncomfortable the entire time and just going with it to appease him .
 he talks her in circles to purposely confuse her and later ,  in a tweet kim says  &apos;i did not edit the video ,  i just showed the parts that fit my narrative &apos; .
 it has but they have made further aggressive moves within the last week .
 i hope you guys didn &apos;t need to call the navy in for assistance .
 i didn &apos;t know any of his kids .
 gambler is a good track .
 i think there &apos;s an obvious angle here:  brady wanted to move to florida .
 it depends on the type of war though .
 ethiopia has wild geography ,  an invasion would by no means be easy .
 it sounds as if the egyptian army would have to be the aggressor in this scenario .
 egypt definitely has the stronger military ,  but it would be a tough war to effectively“win” .
 nope ,  just makes internet people feel better .
 need 1mil+ and media attention to do anything
 the scale of this discovery is huge
 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr - pronounced “crisper”) utilizes the cas9 enzyme and a plasmid in order to “cut” dna and insert the sequence of nucleic acids that you desire .
 in essence ,  one can select which parts of dna that are undesirable and replace them with something else that is synthesized in a lab .
 some ethical questions that arise are long-term implications of experimentation with humans ,  as they are unknown .
 this is a very brief review of it from a biochemistry undergraduate’s perspective .
 pardon any mistakes .
 basically genetic modification .
 it &apos;s good bc it can treat gwnetic diseases like said above ,  but it can be horrifying as it can lead to terrible things ie designer babies
 from what i understand from my friends living there ,  zagreb was shut down as of that morning basically ,  so most people were at home .
 ebola is insanely scary with an incredibly high fatality rate
 i heard eleven ,  but in either case holy shit .
 i’m an elementary school teacher here and i’m so worried for my students .
 there’s apparently at least one male elementary school teacher involved with those chat rooms and i wouldn’t be surprised if there’s more .
 those kinds of people cannot be around kids
 i have a nine year old girl .
 that makes me want to vomit .
 iirc either one piece of content had 260k total views or there was 260k views across all the content shared .
 total views ,  not unique views .
 it &apos;s  &apos;only &apos; really 10-30k users ,  260k is the number of views that some of the media shared in it had iirc ,  but that includes re-views from the same people .
  &apos;some of these acts included cutting off a nipple ,  having sex with one’s brother ,  carving of the word “slave” or the pimp’s name with a knife in the skin ,  putting scissors into the vagina ,  eating feces ,  and even getting raped by assigned people .
 at least one of the victims has already committed suicide .
 then it continues to say if the girl refuses ,  they reveal their personal identities so people can go find them and rape them .
 brb i need some eye bleach after that
  &apos;as footage of violent rape is expensive to sell &apos; .
 i &apos;m 22 years old and i just learned that this was a luxury item .
 it doesn &apos;t make sense to me that people pay for things like that
 they &apos;ve already caught the  &apos;guru &apos; (phd or baksa in korean) ,  a 25-year old suspect named jubin jo (this bastard screwing up his youth in prison) .
 still ,  people are petitioning to reveal the 2030k people who are in the chatroom because they are partaking in this crime .
 thanks for replying mate but how can they force companies to stop using it but not ban the technology ?
 genuinely trying to understand how this would work .
 my new favorite conspiracy theory is that covid-19 was created by the municipal transportation authority in seattle .
 not sure it &apos;s trying to sneak under the radar versus the jig being up .
 like if i embezzled a million dollars and things are going well with the company ,  i can cover it up; the accounts have a million dollars less than what management thinks ,  but the business keeps operating .
 suddenly a crisis hits ,  the company needs to spend that million ,  and there &apos;s no way i can conceal that it isn &apos;t there .
 boom ,  fraud detected .
 the one time a spanish inquisition was expected ,  and they didn &apos;t come through .
 he has been acting as a comission agent since he became a king .
 instead of working for the country he has been working for the highest bidder .
 this comment is too funny to be hidden this far down
 how cool for you !
 i remember being really small ,  like 4-6 years old ,  and the halley-comet was really hyped up then .
 me ,  dreaming of being an astronaut one day ,  really enjoyed staying outdoors with my parents for it - it was a beautiful ,  unique experience and has acted as a memory that fuels my interest in anything related .
 i really wish you a nice comet-viewing and good health :)
 not to promote the devastation of a region or anything ,  but i &apos;d be semi interested in the cartoon antics part of that all .
 there was an old lady who swallowed a spider .
 good omens was a whole lot more fun to watch than live through .
 this made me feel better so thank you
 passover &apos;s coming up soon ,  too .
 if all the karens of the world would just mob up to talk to end-times &apos; manager ,  that &apos;d be great .
 california regularly passes tax increases on friday afternoons especially before 3 day weekends
 apple and amazon might just pack up and move to greener pastures if this passes ,  i’d think .
 that ,  or split their us operations from international operations .
 either way they have powerful lobbyists and deep pockets .
 also banking the entire banking industry depends on very robust encryption else you have to air gap everything .
 its not the 60’s every penny is thru the internet
 yeah but this is one open source program hosted in a country that still gives a shit away from being unenforceable .
 i really appeciate your insight as someone whos been on that side of the bars .
 i hope you are in a good place :)
 she is in jail ,  though ,  and the local bondsmen are refusing to assist her with her $1m bail .
 no one will come to them on her behalf ,  and it &apos;s a larger bond than they see in the area .
 there is also speculation she has not been able to prove she and her husband have assets to cover the remaining 90% of bail .
 one bondsperson said she told lori if she can give proof of life of the children ,  she would be willing to post for her .
 but she couldn &apos;t ,  or didn &apos;t .
 some people from kauai sent jj &apos;s grandmother and grandfather leis (i &apos;m not sure what they were made from ,  but i think that was symbolic ?
 ) to show their support ,  and they wore them to her first trial after she was extradited .
 woman married a guy whose wife died like a month prior .
  important to note here that this new guy is a member of a religious cult .
 woman’s ex also died ,  although unrelated .
 her kids ,  ages like 7 and 17 ,  haven’t been heard from since september and authorities wanted to know why ,  so when they went to ask her ,  she basically disappeared .
 her and her new husband wound up in hawaii about a month ago .
 woman won’t tell authorities where the kids/their bodies are .
 as of yesterday ,  news came out that she believed her kids were possessed by spirits or were zombies or something .
 for some reason russia likes maintaining the illusion that they &apos;re still a democracy .
 probably because certain other world leader(s ?
 ) still continue to fall for it .
 did they ever stop ?
 or did the media just stop covering it ?
 my old boss was a secret alcoholic sadly also a sikh ,  he used to hide tiny whisky bottles (from his family) under his turban ,  he was a genuinely sound guy ,  and a good boss too .
 yeah one of the senators in question actually voted against a bill in 2012 that banned insider trading on the basis of confidential information while in office .
 he was one of three to vote against it .
 he knew he would one day want to use information he gets in office for his own financial gain .
 yep ,  which means that the government (and anyone who &apos;s decent at using computers) could get into any person or corporations secrets if they are able to intercept a message .
 normally it &apos;s not a problem because of end to end encryption .
 that’s still technically illegal
 the patriot act .
 the name was brilliant branding ,  as it &apos;s a crazy power grab with a lot of nasty shit hidden in there .
 but how do you vote against something labeled  &apos;patriot &apos; ?
 they also just  &apos;re-upped &apos; it
 if any of you read further articles and translated statements from the prosecution ,  you’ll understand exactly how messed up the sex acts these women and girls were forced to perform .
 body mutilations like  !
 slicing off their nipples ,  gang rape ,  forced to eat scat ,  mental and physical torture of all kinds  !
 stuff you read about when you look up deep web torture cam stories .
 cho and the others should be executed .
 time shouldn’t even be wasted on them keeping them alive .
 that asshole couldn’t even muster a half assed apology when asked for a statement ,  instead thanking prosecutors for stopping him .
 his face is completely without remorse .
 people like this have no redeemable value for human society .
 what frightens me even more than just the crime happening in itself is that the reaction from the public is  &apos;mixed &apos; .
 of course many are horrified and want further investigation ,  but some have little to no sympathy to the victims as some  &apos;willingly posted nudes online &apos; and therefore gave the criminals a way to blackmail them .
 there &apos;s also a comparison to another case where a male celebrity had a video of him masturbating leaked ,  and many publicly gave him the cold shoulder saying things like  &apos;there was no reason to make something like that &apos; .
 in korea there is still a lot of victim blaming in cases of sexual abuse ,  revenge porn ,  and other crimes which to me is just heartbreaking ,  especially considering the ages of some of the victims in this case .
 that number is wrong ,  the suspected number by the police is 10k - 30k .
 260k was made by adding the total number of views (i think it was views but i may be wrong) without accounting for the fact that most would be from the same people .
 how do you even come across telegram groups ?
 yeah with diseases like this it is sort of like cancer where you cam test negative but still have a small undetectable amount so they keep checking in case it resurges .
 so if it stays away for sure then it &apos;s a cure ,  that &apos;s why this hiv stuff is reported repeatedly but it &apos;s just news confirming he &apos;s still cured .
 well ,  still happy for that guy
 flying v ,  bitch .
 it’s knuckle puck time .
 and finally ,  send in the locusts to eat the rotting corpses in the spring thaw
 we could just eat the ducks .
 death is everywhere as well
 the fourth horseman ,  who rides a pale (khloros) horse ,  is the only horseman given a name: thanatos -- death .
 another fun fact !
 : the translation of the horse &apos;s color is typically  &apos;pale &apos; but in the sense of  &apos;ashen ,  sickly ,  pallid &apos; suggested by the original greek ,  which lends its meaning in words like chlorophyll ,  the substance that converts light to energy in plants and gives the leaves a green color .
 this suggests that death rides a horse that is corpse-like .
 what will they get to kill all the ducks though ?
 til locusts come back and leave as often as my dad
 but we &apos;ve always been at war with eurasia
 considering the advanced age of every candidate still left in the presidential race ,  covid-19 might pick the next president for us .
 it &apos;s going to change nothing .
  if you hated trump before you aren &apos;t going to like his response and won &apos;t vote for him (wouldn &apos;t have anyway) .
  if you liked trump before you probably think he did a good job handling the crisis and the economic downturn is out of his control - so you &apos;ll still vote for him .
 the current polls support this theory .
 the only politics i want to hear are which toilet paper barons i &apos;m going to sacrifice my rations to ,  to get that sweet sweet tp .
 oh ,  grugg the toilet paper baron of the west was slain by the forces of bolbi the toilet paper baron of the east and we are now living within his domain ?
 don &apos;t care as long as my water flavored ration tax isn &apos;t raised .
 while that is certainly true ,  even people as dumb as us senators should be able to grasp the idea that if you make a hole in the wall of a bank to let the police in quicker ,  then bank robbers can also go in through the hole in the wall .
 it really is that simple .
 online banking does not rely on section 230 protections ,  so they would continue to use encryption .
 it would never happen because it makes no sense and would he impossible to enforce .
 _laughs in prohibition_
 after life is great ,  they got pizza and shit
 a few months of reduced emissions wont have a large impact on climate
 why wouldn &apos;t egypt just blow up the dam ?
 the migration to this bio-tech will go swimmingly
 real life create-a-character
 south korea uses lunar calendar to ages ,  so is possible that both are the same girl - eleven in sk and 9 for everybody else .
 is heartbreaking nonetheless .
 for anyone &apos;s information sake ,  he (probably) put the quotation marks there to show that 10-30k is still way too many poeple .
 because ,  it is .
 an example mentioned is that the government will no longer grant section 230 protections to companies using end-to-end encryptions in the u .
  &apos;comply with our rules or you will not be allowed to do business here .
  &apos; kinda like how the eu did it .
 so a firm that wants to use encryption can keep on doing it ,  they &apos;ll just not be allowed to operate in the us and to do business with american users .
 if they do ,  they &apos;ll probably get massive fines and possibly be blocked by american isps
 don &apos;t be ridiculous .
 the government actually created covid-19 to keep people inside while they change the batteries on all the birds .
 dammit ,  sdot teaming up with the gates foundation to release covid-19 to pay back a personal favor to the gates family .
 this is what happened to a previous boss of mine .
 he wasn’t letting us write off uncollectible invoices (usually duplicate invoices) so it looked like a lot of money was owed to us .
 then a downturn hit and the board wanted to borrow against the large accounts receivable balance but couldn’t because the bank did an audit which showed those invoices are all uncollectible .
 i had to quit the job because he kept trying to get me (the accountant) to say those invoices were collectible but i simply wouldn’t because i knew they weren’t .
 if i’d of known why he wanted me to lie i would have gone above him but i thought he was just an idiot .
 i went to business school and this was one of the first things my finance professor told us - if a company is doing well on paper and stockholders are happy ,   that &apos;s when you look for the fraud .
 no one expects there to be no spanish inquisition
 they’re all in bomb shelters cut off from the world .
 you &apos;re highly mistaken .
 they &apos;re still there making those same cries ,  but their drowned out in the news by the pandemic .
 as the story goes ,  the antichrist will be loved by the false prophets .
 he will come as their savior and take up the crown before the end comes .
 so they won &apos;t see him coming .
 televangelist seem like the ripe fruit to be picked and used by someone like that .
 if anyone &apos;s got any hebrews working for them for the sake of your firstborn let them go on paid leave
 dumping bad news on friday afternoon is a time-honored tradition unfortunately .
 that ,  or split their us operations from international operations .
 they might be forced to or face eu sanctions due to gdpr .
 everything they do relating to the eu would have to be completely and utterly separate from the encryptionless us business or they &apos;d be facing continuous gdpr breaches at up to 4% of global revenue each .
 wait ,  if their lobbyists are so deep-pocketed ,  why is this even up for debate ?
 who’s sponsoring the movement pro-bill ?
 online banking and online commerce .
 people aren &apos;t gonna be buying shit online if there is no security .
 much better of a place than i was in the past .
 thank you for your kind words ,  stranger .
 mad question out of the blue here ,  are all bonds in america 10% of what bail is set at ?
 i was watching something recently where bail was set at 12k but they only put forward 1 , 200 .
 if so ,  why not just set the bail to whatever 10% is instead of these wild numbers you sometimes see .
 i cannot believe i haven’t heard about this .
 this is an astonishing story .
 i really hope those kids turn up ok
 even north korea pretends to be a democracy .
  no ,  seriously ,  it &apos;s in their name and they hold elections .
 they even have multiple parties .
 well ,  their activities were down because they were busy fighting the coalition and then they were busy being on the run .
 i don’t know if anyone thought they were done for good ,  though .
 i remember the media warning when the caliphate was defeated that they’d probably regroup eventually .
 so he was a sikhret alcoholic .
 and if the government can ,  anyone can .
 not to mention what it would do to online financial transactions .
 hey ,  when you buy stuff online and when you trade stocks ,  they keep those transactions secure by way of encryption .
 encryption with back doors (or more accurately ,  front doors that the service provider holds the keys to) doesn &apos;t count as  &apos;end to end .
 but is a lot different than if an adult did it .
 there &apos;s a difference in the morality of it between teens and between a teen and adult .
 the patriot act is one of the most unpatriotic pieces of legislation in this nation .
 it &apos;s so much of a misnomer that it &apos;s comical .
 even obama re-upped it and added on articles 1021 and 1022 to the ndaa in his first term .
 its the dangers of letting any organization grow too much political power ,  our checks and balances don &apos;t work anymore and haven &apos;t for a long ,  long ,  time .
 our two party system has destroyed the original intent of the constitution ,  and the bill of rights .
 lots of arguing allowed ,  but only along a limited spectrum .
 and here is was thinking that it was  &apos;normal &apos; sex acts (which would obviously still be horrible .
 not as horrible ,  after reading that ?
 the article said 10k members ,  wanted to see if anyone could clarify the discrepancy of op and the article .
 danger lurks behind you !
 people can hunt them i suppose ,  more food ?
 or was it eastasia ?
 freedom is slavery ,   .
 ignorance is strength ,   .
 big brother is watching .
 you &apos;ve been clearly been deluded by goldstein and his followers .
 go to room 101 please .
 either pick the candidates or pick the voters .
 i &apos;m glad that the term toilet paper baron is entering our lexicon .
 the silver lining of all of this .
 but you &apos;re supposed to put a sign over the hole that says ,   &apos;authorized person &apos;s only &apos; .
  that way the bad guys can &apos;t use it .
 but it &apos;s illegal and we all know illegal things never happen .
 i don’t understand what this means ,  does anyone have time to break it down ?
 if the usa banned e2e encryption ,  i would move my app servers to mexico and canada .
 and my app doesn &apos;t even handle sensitive data .
 theres already a ton of infrastructure in vancouver which would likely serve as the new hub for west coast data centers .
 ethiopia’s ally (sudan ,  a nation situated between the two countries) ,  won’t let that happen .
 sudan supports the dam ,  without the dam they face huge floods followed by very low water ,  they want the water to be stable all year round .
 sudan has publicly admitted they want the dam now .
 egypt doesn’t have the logistic resources or numbers to run a multi-day campaign over 1 , 500 miles of hostile territory .
 ethiopia has high-tech military machinery that’s advanced enough to repulse any land or air-missile attack imposed by egyptian military .
 if egypt’s military forces tampered with the dam heavily funded by china and italy ,  ethiopia could easily retaliate very harshly by blowing up their aswan dam ,  washing 95% of egypt into the sea and putting cairo underwater .
 and trust me ,  the west won’t sit back and watch a predominantly christian country take a beaten by a muslim one .
 egypt= muslim country .
 ethiopia= predominantly orthodox christian ,  with an ancient ethiopian jew population that has significant ties backed and supported by israel .
 this whole situation is fintastic !
 not really super important for the topic at hand but it &apos;s not lunar calendar for ages ,  it &apos;s just that everyone is 1 when they are born and they grow an year older every year january 1st !
 that &apos;s wild ,  will it likely pass ?
 and work on fixing the wyoming facade .
 this is such a stupid theory .

 “all of the birds died in 1986 due to reagan killing them and replacing them with spies that are now watching us .
 the birds work for the bourgeoisie”
 similar thing happened to me; company had cash flow problems and was under a lot of pressure from the board/creditors to improve sales .
 well ,  turns out that sop was to make duplicate or outright fraudulent invoices and defraud our customers by taking their money ,  knowing damn well it would be at least 12-18 months until these people received what they had paid for .
 of course we weren &apos;t allowed to disclose this to customers ,  as the only goal was to make the sell ,  collect payment ,  and inflate the sells numbers .
 we also weren &apos;t allowed to enter rma &apos;s into our inventory system so the fraudulent sales stayed on the books .
 i knew some shady shit was going on so ,  being curious ,  i actually went to the warehouse to check the inventory and a lot of boxes were stuffed with paper .
 no actual products ,  just empty boxes so that the company could make it look as if they actually had inventory if anyone came snooping around .
 i then asked who the fuck does the auditing around here and was told that this company didn &apos;t allow outside audits and had never conducted an internal audit of inventory; turns out no one ever conducted an audit because accounting and upper management were all in on this bullshit .
 i promptly quit when i noticed someone in the sales department (most likely my manager) was using my credentials after i had left work to generate fraudulent invoices .
 if you dont show up to court ,  you owe the other 90% .
 generally people get a bail bond (because they cannot afford to pay their full bail in cash) .
 in that case you put forward 10% and the bail bond (basically a loan) garuntees the other 90% and if you skip youre on the hook .
 so as this thread states ,  if you have no assets (or no one with assets to cosign) ,  a bail bondsman wont front the other 90% to get you out of jail .
 if someone doesn’t have enough cash to post bail ,  then they are typically allowed to find a bondsman to help .
  a bondsman decides the percentage and usually charges 10-15% of the bail amount before they would pay the full amount .
 00 bond and can’t pay it .
  i would charge you $1 , 000 .
  once i am paid ,  i would go to the clerk’s office and pay the full $10 , 000 .
  i am also taking a risk ,  because i am telling the court that i will be responsible for you showing up to court .
 when your case is disposed ,  then i get my $10 , 000 .
 however ,  if you skip town and go on the run ,  i have to bring you back to court or risk losing the $10 , 000 .
 00 i gave to the court .
  i then hire a bounty hunter and will pay them to find you and bring you back .
  once you are caught ,  i get my money back if the judge hasn’t yet ordered the bond to be forfeited .
 you cannot pay your own bond but you can give someone the funds to pay it for you .
 this is overly simplified and varies state by state ,  but i hope it helps !
 who the fuck is cox ?
 that came out of nowhere with no explanation .
 now i &apos;m just more confused lol
 and also isn’t the brother dead now ?
 all totally unrelated though
 hope all you want ,  a little optimism never hurt anybody ,  but pretty sure we’re well past that point by now
 yeah ,  but the rest of the world doesn &apos;t treat nk like they &apos;re a legitimate democracy .
 trump congratulated putin on his electoral  &apos;win &apos; 2 years ago ,  despite so many experts telling him not to .
 that joke was disturban .
 “we will only let good guys have access” .

 this is worse than forcing you to hand over a key to your house to the police .
 but hey ,  if you aren’t breaking any laws .
 trust him ,  he &apos;s the fbi man 
 i know a guy who is in his 40s who is a felon for having consensual sex with a 14 year old and he was 16 at the time .
 her parents decided to drop the charges but the state proceeded anyway .
 he has had trouble finding a job or a place to live ever since .
 no ones sees the context just that he is a felon sex offender .
 not to mention ,  he &apos;s black and this was in texas .
 (thought i &apos;d mention it anyway) .
 doesn &apos;t stop the government from filling up those private prisons with young ,  capable workers unfortunately .
 it was revealed recently he took $4 million  for a contract killing to murder a mother and child .
 he also threatened and extorted journalists by hacking into their personal information and sending frequent death threats to them and their families .
 warning: the following involves threats of sexual violence ,  descriptions of sexual violence ,  etc .
 the following is an example of a threat sent to a victim by one of the 13 perpetrators .
 “hello ,  seems like you’re still alive ?
 i sent a usb drive to your school ,  but judging from the way you act ,  it seems like you still haven’t fully gotten my message yet .
 i’m sure i’ve said this clearly before .
 if you don’t listen to me ,  i will fck up your life .
 reply to this message as soon as you received it .
 if you don’t then i’m gonna send your father videos of you masturbating with a dildo in the bathroom ,  along with the sex slavery contract that you word .
 i’m also going to share all of your videos on twitter’ ‘don’t ever think you can get out of this ,  i won’t be saying this twice .
 i’m going to send something to your house .
 i hope you’ll live with this fear for the rest of your life”
 there’s a stranger out to find you
 there are three that cause death ,  and one that is death

 \minilove has entered the chat\
 are you an enemy of the state or something ?
 eastasia has always been our ally ,  you can literally look at our historical records .
  &apos; screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen .
 bend lower ,  please !
 you can do better than that .
 you &apos;re not trying .
 that &apos;s better ,  comrade !
 you laugh but that disclaimer is on just about every piece of networking equipment i &apos;ve ever touched .
  &apos;if you are not authorized for use ,  you must disconnect immediately !
 like i &apos;m sure the threat actors see that and just immediately close their sessions like  &apos;oh shit ,  i almost broke the rule !
 section 230 lets websites not be responsible for what their users say or do .
 doesn &apos;t relate to banks since user activity isn &apos;t public facing .
 section 230 apparently is under attack given tech companies being lack luster in moderating their users .
 one way it is under attack is the idea of banning end to end encryption so that governments can see whatsapp messages etc
 a long time ago in the early days of the internet ,  some isp/websites (whatever you call compuserve and prodigy) got sued for hosting copyrighted content .
  compuserve said  &apos;we don &apos;t moderate what goes on our network ,  we &apos;re just a platform &apos; ,  they got off free .
  prodigy had moderation teams that enforced rules ,  and they were found guilty because they had taken an editorial role in their own content .
 people brought this issue to their congresspeople ,  saying that if websites can &apos;t have rules without being held responsible for content ,  the internet would turn to shit .
  so in 1996 they wrote section 230 of the communications deceny act ,  which says internet hosting platforms are exempt from the distinction - they can take an editorial role ,  remove rule-breaking content ,  and avoid legal liability from illegal content on their platforms .
  a website that only allows pictures of cats would then be allowed to remove/ban pictures of dogs without being sued for a user posting a clip of a disney movie .
 lately ,  some major internet hosting platforms like youtube ,  google ,  and twitter have been accused of taking political bias in their moderation .
  politicians have spent the last 4 years trying to repeal or remove section 230 protections so that these websites can no longer moderate content at all without facing major legal repercussions for illegal content on their platforms .
 this  &apos;earn it &apos; act is the latest in a string of attacks on section 230 ,  which would force platforms like twitter or facebook or youtube to  &apos;earn &apos; section 230 protections by proving it is feasibly impossible to host child pornography or child-exploitative content .
  the only way to make that impossible is to remove end-to-end encryption so that facebook can spy on every private user-to-user message and make sure they &apos;re not using facebook messenger to share kiddie porn .
 wow geopolitics are so fucking intricate .
 it blows my mind how well versed some people are ,  because that &apos;s one area in which i &apos;m pretty clueless
 the ethiopian military has an annual budget of $330 million .
 egypt has more than 10 times that .
 not to mention the recent shopping spree the egyptian military has been on ,  rafale fighters ,  german subs etc .
 in addition to the +200 f-16 that are operated by egypt .
 on the over hand ,  ethiopia only has 14 su-27s and some mid range chinese sams .
 no where near enough to deny access to a determined aggressor ,  .
 without a doubt egypt has a complete military advantage over ethiopia .
 this is without considering the close support they will probably receive from the riyadh ,  abu dhabi ,  and khartoum axes .
 everybody is focused on something else right now ,  too much to properly contest the bill .
 almost makes you think about the government &apos;s response to the crisis .
 i mean ,  i &apos;ve never been to wyoming .
 that actually makes a tonne of sense ,  thanks a lot for the explanation ,  i had always thought the bail had to be paid in full until very recently when i discovered 10% (in a certain state at least) was all that was required to be released .
 cox is her brother who died under mysterious circumstances .
 i hate you both .
 (thank you ,  i needed a laugh)
 this is worse than forcing you to hand over a key to your house to the police .
 it &apos;s like outlawing locks on doors .
 what &apos;s not to trust ?
 her parents decided to drop the charges but the state proceeded anyway .
 that &apos;s because it was never their decision .
 and for the record ,  i &apos;m with you here .
 what happened to this man is wrong ,  almost criminal in its own right .
 a modern scarlet letter .
 but in a criminal trial ,  victims do not press or drop charges ,  ever .
 it &apos;s always going to be texas (or some state) v the defendant or the united states v the defendant .
 this might not sound true to a lot of people ,  but that &apos;s because tv and movies frequently get it wrong ,  e .
  &apos;he was beating his wife but she didn &apos;t want to press charges so there was nothing we could do ,  lieutenant .
 i &apos;m not trying to nitpick -- i just think this is the sort of thing more people should know .
 the superducks ,  of course .
 honestly just listen to the telescreen
 i used to be in networking and that was the exact example i was thinking of .
 i thought that was a necessary warning to ensure unauthorized personnel can be punished for accessing that equipment .
 with the message there ,  they can &apos;t feign ignorance .

 if you’re a student or are really trying to stay focused at work there’s and app called the forest: stay focused (i could be wrong but it’s definitely the forest) .
 it’s a free app that’s available as an extension on google chrome or the apple appstore .
 basically ,  you plant a tree ,  set a time limit and you can only go on the sites that you’ve added to the whitelist or your tree will die .
 it’s designed to stop you from always being in social media while you’re supposed to be studying or doing something productive .
 it &apos;s free ,  free knowledge !

 i’m like 70% deaf (on top of auditory processing disorder that probably stems from my autism) and i’d really love to meet a stranger that signs .
 it’s only ever happened once ,  when some random little kid translated for me at starbucks .
 free language immersion programs .
 i’m not just talking about duolingo .
 • tandem and hellotalk are free language exchange apps .
 you put in the language you’re learning and it connects you with native speakers that want to learn your native language .
 i’ve heard of people having problems with speakers using it as a dating app ,  but i’ve never had that happen myself .
 • there are language immersion discord servers for nearly any language you want to learn .
 you can usually just google it and find one somewhere .
 subreddits for languages oftentimes have their own discord servers .
 • google chrome has several extensions that will translate phrases for you ,  teach you new words ,  etc .
 without any extra effort .
 you’re practically learning a language every time you use the internet .
 ( gloss ,  kypsis ,  and langulearn are good ones !
 • if there’s a popular public domain book in english ,  chances are ,  it’s been translated and is in public domain in other languages .
 usually when learning a language ,  i’ll try to be able to read the little prince by the end of my first year of learning—which isn’t public domain everywhere but is still easy to find ,  never too expensive ,  and usually easy to read .
 steam when pc games are free to purchase .

 the thousands of free abstracts of research papers on sites like pubmed .
 freecodecamp ,  it’s founder quincy is a great guy and freecodecamp is a legit way to learn to code .
  it has a great reputation with self taught coders
 patrickjmt has very good calculus tutorials .
 for parents ,  commonsensemedia .
 lays out new movies and apps and other pop culture items and discussed them and the age appropriateness in case the parent is unaware of what something is .
 there’s also “classes” about how teens and kids can learn to responsibly use the internet .
 seems dumb but i try to plug it any chance i get .
 can someone fill me in on what that excessively gilded deleted comment was ?
 many states in the us should have an anti-hiv/ sexual health program where they discreetly mail you a pack of condoms for free after you fill out a super short anonymous survey .
 the “caveat” is the shipping time is around 2-3 weeks but hey they’re free .
 step 1: download duolingo .
 step 2: learn hindi .
 step 3: you now have infinite knowledge on youtube
 mit open courseware .
 (only have experience with their math classes .
 ) it &apos;s better than taking the classes from your university professor .
 i am good at math ,  but i struggled in the university setting .
 i found myself learning all the material 2 weeks late .
 the lectures were to a class of 150-300 people ,  and their was almost always a language barrier preventing me from fully grasping the content until after the test .
 when i was having difficulty in calc iii due to my heavily accented russian professor who was only teaching the class because he had a minimum quota of classes to teach each year to stay employed for his research in number theory ,  my teaching assistant helped a bit ,  but not enough .
 i found mit open courseware ,  and although the teacher had a minor german accent ,  he wanted to teach .
 it made a world of difference ,  and if i missed anything ,  i could rewind 20 seconds and hear it again .
 most importantly ,  these teachers are absolutely amazing at giving you what you need .
 the mit staff are not there because they are super smart ,  (although they might also be that) but instead because they are the best teachers .
 i &apos;m convinced anyone who wants to learn can from them .
 after that successful turning around of a grade ,  i used it again for differential equations and linear algebra .
 i aced (100%) both finals for diffeq and linear algebra ,  despite being a c student for most of the semesters in the classes .
 my only regret is not watching each lecture during the semester ,  instead of all in a row before the finals .
 tl;dr: you are almost better off watching the mit open courseware lectures with headphones on a laptop while attending your math classes at a large university than paying attention to your professors .

 bob and brad (the two most famous physical therapists on the internet ,  in their opinion ,  of course) on youtube .
 their exercises have done wonders for my shoulder and lower back pain .
 i take some of their non physical-therapy advice with a grain of salt ,  but what i’ve tried that is pt related has worked
 don’t mind me ,  just saving this thread for later
 his contributions to modern literature and discourse in the public form have influenced and enriched today &apos;s society and culture in ways that few people truly comprehend .
 lots of people post drum covers .
 i learn cool songs ,  new fills and all sorts on there !
 it’s the reason why i’ve come this far over the past 9 years .
 its a free internet browser that plants a tree everytime you make a search .
 i find it has less adds and better results and it makes me feel a little better inside asking all the dumb questions i do .
 i just want to say that this comment thread is so nice it brings hope in me that people really wanna help each other and support it each other in everything .
 good job humanity :d
 li - great for many resources  .
 org - great for scientific publications
 wow fuck the mods in here for incinerating the 2nd most popular post .

 if you aren’t on reddit ,  i’d highly advise joining
 i scrolled down so many comments and didn’t see free annual credit report .
 you have a free k-12 education .
 stumbleupon - it’s a free browser extension that shows you cool websites like these listed in this thread .
 you can sign up and tell em what you’d like to see/know and they’ll tailor your experience to those things .
 don’t like a site recommended to check out ?
 you can rate it and bam never to be seen again .
 or just press the stumble button for hours and hours of procrastination !
 it’s super addicting !
 if you’re an amazon shopper ,  review everything you get .
 not just star rate and “i liked it .
 ”  pretend you’re ashens and tell everyone why they should or should not buy this product .
 over the years ,  i’ve been sent so much free stuff from companies ,  and now amazon has a program to just get free stuff directly .
 you have to qualify for it ,  and the way to qualify is to write helpful reviews for things you’ve already bought .
 i’ve got a decent streaming setup for twitch ,  largely for free by doing this .

 paint dot net is an equally good picture editing software at the cost of nothing .
 if you still have an independent pharmacy in your area ,  please consider supporting them instead .
 for many drugs they &apos;re cheaper than the big chains in the first place ,  but they &apos;ll often price match too .
 discount cards like goodrx save you money but charge the pharmacy a fee on every claim .
 needymeds is another good resource .
 i love how you point out that the commercials are depressing .
 i felt sharp cognitive dissonance when watching them .
 like ,  we take it as business-as-usual when a single mother in a low paying job has an inner monologue about maybe buying her sick son &apos;s medicine depending on the price .
 it really shocked me into the depth of shittiness in this country (us) .
 that &apos;s cool , not exactly legal is reddit &apos;s second name

 well that explains why i &apos;ve been getting scam emails .
 damn you club penguin rewritten !
 i &apos;ve been pwned ):
 aaron swartz would be proud .
 one of my ma professors told me he and his collegues use it a lot !
 for what concerns me alexandra elbakyan is a hero .

 i wrote both my ma and ba thesis without any other source for articles
 you can also download the  &apos;unpaywall addon &apos; for your browser .
 it will remove the paywall right there when you go to the research paper
 also useful - go to google scholar ,  search for the study and then click  &apos;all number versions &apos; next to the study .
 more often than not there will be a pdf version which you can scroll through .
 ocenaudio is a good one to start with if you &apos;re new to audio editing .
 a lot of people are asking what top comment said so i &apos;m making this edit .
 it &apos;s not word for word but it &apos;s kind of what was written .
 audacity for audio editing  .
 gimp for photo editing  .
 shotcut for video editing
 don’t forget inkscape for vector graphics !
 or blender for 3d modeling and animation !
 as a web developer ,  i &apos;d vote against w3schools .
 i don &apos;t know if they &apos;ve improved recently ,  but in the 2000 &apos;s ,  they were practically a scam .
 they would sell  &apos;certification &apos; courses and tickets and seemingly tried hard to come across as if they are related to the actual w3c (world wide web consortium) ,  from which they based their name .
 they _were not_ affiliated with the w3c ,  and their certification was not recognized by anyone other than themselves ,  despite the pretty penny it cost .
 their material wasn &apos;t even very quality .
 mdn ,  by mozilla ,  is a more professional and accurate learning resource .
 freecodecamp is much more education-focused and a really good resource for learning web development .
 pixabay and pexels too .
 i &apos;m a journalist and this site is a life saver .
 having a library of copyright free images to use however i like is so useful .
 unsplash is a graphic designers dream .
 i love it so much .
 unsplash is my source for great zoom background images !
 alternatively ,  worldwide radio is an app for chrome and firefox that also has a list of global radio stations if you prefer that .
 number of stations is much smaller ,  though .
 this site fucking rules .
 get new dancehall directly from kingston ,  jamaica .
 find out what darkwave is current in berlin .
 what is folk music in lapland ?
 miss home ,  wherever it is ?
 you can hear your favorite radio host ,  earworms from commercials you grew up with ,  music that makes you feel like a kid again .
 i fucking love this website .
 it’s everything the internet should be .
 there is a radio app/website thats lets you listen to any radio station in the world but the amazing part is you can choose what decade you want
 don’t mind me ,  just posting this here so i can check when i’m back at my pc :)
 this one is great for teachers !
 i &apos;ve gotten a lot of supplies for my art classroom through here
 i get so many craft supplies here .
 one old lady gave me like 50 skeins of baby yarn .
 my sons both have afghans made from them and the lady and i keep in touch ,  i started by randomly sending her a picture of my eldest with a blanket and it just continued from there .
 kanopy is the movie streaming version of libby .
 also just as dope .
 i went from spending around $750cad a year on books/audiobooks to around $100 for the few not available on libby through my library .
 i also have a kobo e-reader to download e-books through libby/overdrive .
 libby is amazing !
 so easy to use and lots of selection .
 definitely recommend this .
 am in canada so know for sure it works here .
 sometimes the wait times for new bestsellers can be a little ridiculous but since the pandemic they &apos;ve added more copies and cut down on wait time tremendously so hopefully they keep doing that .
 is it international ?
 i fuck it up on libby
 there is also a chrome extension legit called library extension that i use .
 whenever you &apos;re looking at books online like on amazon ,  it &apos;ll automatically tell you whether you can borrow that book for free at your local library .
 dude ,  i love you .
 i am 100% getting back into some childhood games tomorrow after work !
 man ,  lego chess was the game that taught me how to play chess .
 i can &apos;t wait to relive the old memories .
 i haven &apos;t played a game of chess in forever too .
 i owe at least half of my physics degree to wolfram alpha
 i knew i was living in the future when i could type in almost any kind of math problem and it would show me the steps to solve it .
 also i can ask it things like what is the population of china divided by 1389
 when trying to determine what would happen if i added baking soda to acidic food ,  i used wolfram alpha to tell me what baking soda and acetic acid break down into ,  and if it was safe to eat .
 your answer has been marked as a duplicate
 i &apos;m sure it is a great resource ,  but i &apos;ve gotta say that site just rubs me the wrong way .
 it seems that every thread has at least one captain know-it-all that is really condescending .
 i don &apos;t use the site often ,  so perhaps i am painting with too broad a brush ,  but i really try to avoid that site if i can .
  by far the funniest genre of thread i &apos;ve repeatedly come across is ,   &apos;i &apos;m trying to do y .
  but the code i wrote does x .
  &apos;  sadly ,  the op never got a good answer .
  meanwhile ,  i found this thread by a google search and it turns out i &apos;m trying to do x .
  thank you very much for the indirect help ,  kind internet stranger !
 i didn &apos;t know about this .
 i &apos;m probably going to use it in the future .

 so useful ,  used this to access some obscure texts for my dissertation .
 such a great resource !
 tubi has some of the best cheesey movies ever .
 i recommend watching the velocipastor
 just a public service announcement : tubi has the first season of angela anaconda .
 you know ,  that obscure show that is part of the opening of the digimon movie ?
 i saw his episode and actually just used the site to file my taxes through turbotax freefile (the real one)
 i &apos;m a cpa and can confirm taxes are fucking hard
 was nice using credit karma this year for the free taxes but of course that will be gone next year with intuit buying them .
 just a heads up ,  anyone making over $69k doesn &apos;t qualify to use any of these free sites
 wish i had this yesterday ,  lol .
 but will definitely will bookmark for next time .
 thanks for looking out .
 what the shit ,  you can &apos;t easily file your taxes for free in the us ?
 i &apos;ll never curse at the inevitable annual mygov password reset again .
 the australian system preloads your past info ,  payslips ,  union fees ,  ect .
 you just have to make changes as needed ,  claim your extra reimbursements and hit submit .
 takes all of about 20 minutes ,  15 of which are spent resetting your password to get in .
 i prefer stayfocusd ,  immediately blocks your access from any site .
 to clarify ,  you can set the blacklisted sites you want to block ,  and even a fixed period of time you have per day to browse those sites .
 yeah it &apos;s called forest and it &apos;s amazing i use it a bunch .
 you can buy the pro version and get different saplings and you can see all your progress for the week .
 there &apos;s also different ambient sounds .
 it &apos;s not free on the apple appstore .
 99$ though and may still be worth it idk
 i googled the forest and found what you were talking about i think .
 i did have to pay and the download was a few gigs but i think you greatly undersold the whole plant a tree thing .
 you see upon opening the forest i found myself on a plane and it crashed and now i’ve spent the last 8 hours running from cannibals while trying to find my son .
 0/10 was too addicting .
 and did you know ,  if you want a credit for a course that you have taken on edx but the price is too high (usually 200$ per credit) ,  just send them a letter to explain for your financial problem .
 99% of the time they will grant you support for 90% of the cost for every credit ,  i took 5 damn quality credits for supply chain management from mit (yes mit) and only paid around 100$ ,  suppppppper stonk my friends ,  all my friends are enjoying this better than any course we have in university !
 i took a microeconomics course in it ,  and i gotta tell you all ,  what would have been a two-semester course took me three months to learn .
 i 100% recommend it .
 mostly 3-6 minute videos covering a topic (you can speed it up or slow it down) ,  discussion forums ,  notes ,  questions ,  and you can get a certificate for certain things .
 great if you have 30 minutes to burn a day .
 i literally just finished an edx course on classroom interactions before i saw this post !
 this got me through college .
 and khan academy kids !
 that app single handedly saved me during this pandemic .
 my kid can play it for hours (if i let him) and he can control the content he plays .
 the other day i heard him listening to the first grade lessons about compound words ,  and he &apos;s been trying to make up compound words on his own now .
 he &apos;s almost four .
 high quality too .
 i learned and really understood so much for my physio class and i wish i found it much sooner than i did .
 i could have used it for other classes .
 oh boy are you right .
 i &apos;m going in to my sophomore year in hs ,  and boy did it help with math .
 they &apos;re having money issues since a lot of kids are having trouble in these times of online classes so if any of you used khan academy through school i would highly encourage you to donate a few dollars to help out one of the best academic resources out there
 my graphic design teacher taught us about photoshop with this site because the school didn’t want to waste money on photoshop that kids would only use for one class .
 fantastic site ,  you can do figuratively anything you can do with photoshop .
 5/10 would recommend
 i use krita as a free offline photoshop
 this actually sounds interesting ,  that said i &apos;d probably be too awkward to do it- still ,  i &apos;m glad this exists .
 how does it have my full name together like that in a sea of random words ?
 what am i missing ?
 this comment needs more attention ,  thanks
 sometimes i just binge watch these
 my grandma was diagnosed with covid this morning and my mom is taking it so hard .
 i sent her the 80 &apos;s tv link and it absolutely made her day .
 thank you for sharing !
 hitfilm express is another great one .
 i started with davinci and found that hitfilm is more intuitive for me .
 give both a try ,  see what you like !
  resolve is basically full-fledged ,  professional-level video editing software ,  that they give away for free .
  no ads ,  no strings .
  it &apos;s only when you get into super high-end stuff like 8k editing and multi-gpu support that you have to pay .
 go on the “here’s reddit on july 25 ,  2005” link and then on the iphone link .
 there’s talk of the first iphone and people are basically not excited for it .
 one person says it will be a disaster .
 little did they know it would turn out to be the most popular phone in the world .
 man ,  til something .
 the internet archive is being sued by book publishers !
 if you can ,  help spread awareness !
 my teacher copied and pasted tests from there when he was being lazy .
 god bless those at quizlet- they got me through anatomy and physiology .
 have i not needed to deal with a watermark for the past 6 months ?
 wait ,  so why doesn &apos;t it cost to get windows now ?
  no key needed to be purchased or anything ?
 i use this for bootcamp on my macbook for occasional games and such and people should know that there &apos;s a couple strings attached .
 one is that you can &apos;t change the desktop background (who cares) .
 the other is there &apos;s a watermark on the corner of the screen that says  &apos;this copy of windows needs to be activated .
  &apos; or something like that .
 slightly annoying but not a big deal .
 also ,  if you do this ,  be sure to pick the pro edition of windows when you install (assuming you &apos;re not going to pay for it) since you get some nice utilities that way (like remote desktop service) .
 fwiw the iso files for windows have been freely available for several versions now .
 i &apos;m not sure about 10 ,  but with previous versions you still needed a valid license key to register and have a legal copy .
 to clarify: full windows 10 is not free ,  but you can still upgrade any win7/8 pc by using microsoft &apos;s updater .
 you can also just utilise an unused license key from any windows 7/8 pc .
 although they claim to have ended the free update program years ago ,  it still works fine .
 let &apos;s not forget pbs space time
 can you elaborate maybe ?
 i &apos;ve been thinking of trying online schooling but don &apos;t know if it &apos;s worth it compared to a community college/trade school .
 i’ve recently started learning asl from youtube .
 seriously you can learn entire college courses on youtube absolutely for free ,  it’s crazy .
 i enjoy watching bill vicars channel ,  i like the way he teaches .
 also ,  for anyone trying to learn sign for the love of all that is good learn the asl alphabet first and get familiar with it .
 being fluent in the alphabet alone will take you strides further in communicating with someone who is deaf .
 i remember doing this in the computer labs as a kid .
 it was pretty fun back then ,  but the website looked a lot different !
 i’m glad to hear it’s still up !
 tabs for a cause also do this really well .
 if you use chrome and have tons of tabs open ,  you can donate your ad revenue to a cause of your choice .
 i &apos;d recommend givedirectly .
 i forgot about this !
 make sure to turn your adblockers off for that site .
 the ad revenue is what is used to pay for the rice .
 no ads = no rice .
 i question the legitimacy of that site ever since i was a kid .
 was just telling someone about freerice last week !
 it was very big during my college years - small ,  private ,  nerd college with no greek system allowed .
 in the 90s ,  so the internet was wild but also a baby .
 this guy is a lifesaver !
 i love that this exists .
 the couple of the previous tenants of my apartment had this and never updated their address ,  so a get a couple of children &apos;s books every month .
 thankfully i know a couple of people who work with children ,  so they put them to good use .
 i use comminsensemedia to help me decide if i can show something in my classroom without parents getting angry
 common sense media is all right but not great .
 they’re good if you want to know what’s in a movie to make sure it’s safe for your kid ,  but they always go 3-4 years too high for their age ratings .
 i always scroll down to the what parents and kids think section ,  you get much better age ratings there
  it says something about being logged in to flickr  .
  i don &apos;t have a flickr ,  what &apos;s up with that ?

 someone posted a link for free condoms in my state a couple weeks ago and i saw there were options for different types of condoms so i picked flavored and i got over 50 flavored condoms in the mail .
 i am not even sure what to do with them .
 that &apos;s really interesting ,  is that a thing in missouri ?
 as i native hindi speaker ,  i feel fucking proud of the knowledge we give out
 yeah but now i have to buy a bunch of hard drives to store all my linux distros .
 just threw ubuntu 20 .
 04 onto a 10 year old laptop ,  and it runs great .
  i also upgraded the ram and threw in an ssd and it &apos;s practically brand new .
 i &apos;m learning dutch off of duolingo ,  and it &apos;s so easy and fun that i deleted all my other mobile games .
 unfortunately ,  there &apos;s a constant pressure to do lessons or the duolingo owl will murder my family .
 real talk ,  don &apos;t use duolingo to learn japanese .
 it is often very counterproductive and doesn &apos;t work for this language .
 i recommend starting off with learning hiragana and the basic kanji .
 the genki 1 textbook is a brilliant resource for beginners :)
 spanish or vanish
 i would change the link because you just accidentally doxxed your location .
 what spooked me is that my exact location had one of my hobbies as a word
 i think you doxxed yourself chief .
 to figure out the three words wouldn &apos;t you need to know your gps coordinates anyways ?
 so how is this helpful ?
 not trying to be rude ,  i just don &apos;t get it .
 libreoffice has replaced openoffice .
 handbrake is for encoding ,  not editing .
 davinci resolve is an excellent free editor .
 you can even learn how to grow pistols in your backyard .
 youtube has made cheap diy car repairs so much easier .
 you can literally look up your model and follow it step by step too .
 i watched youtube for eight minutes and i can already use sleight of hand to palm some beans into my neighbour &apos;s garden and grow them without using up my own plots .
 agreed ,  you can learn anything off it and you can gain a vast array of knowledge .
 same here ,  i got a shit ton of stuff on my save thing ,  but it would be more easier to find it via comment history .
 ublock origin specifically
 ublock origin is better
 im not on reddit .
 where is the sign in sheet ?
 but where am i now ?
 i feel like the universe is collapsing in on me
 wikipedia is totally underrated ,  it has a bunch of articles over almost everything you could want to know .
 it &apos;s a shame that teachers tell kids that it isn &apos;t a reliable source to use .
 also if you can &apos;t use wikipedia all the article sources are at the bottom of the page and you can use those .
 the reason the comment is still visible for you is because reddit allows you to see what you said regardless of what mods do to it .
 if you open the permalink in a incognito window you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s missing .
 no idea why they are blocking it though ,  seems super weird .
 i was only on club penguin rewritten
 same for me with canva
 atleast change passwords ,  don &apos;t use an account with the same email and password that was pwnd .
 ideally ,  use something like bitwarden ,  a password manager and protect it with two factor authentication .
 so you have a unique long complex password per site .
 i’ve also been pwned .
 thanks ,  words with friends .
 holy shit she &apos;s awesome !
 fuck it &apos;s blocked in my country .
 nevermind just used a vpn to acess it
 i really fucking hope they never shut it down .
 rip ppl take up the cause
 i didn &apos;t get copies of my own research papers and i downloaded it from sci .
 publishing industry is fucking evil .
 i am all in support of her .
 what the hell happened to the top two comments ?
 if you know adobe photo you can work gimp with easy .
 top comment is gilded ,  awarded ,  upvoted 12k times and i can &apos;t fucking see it because it &apos;s deleted .
 as a designer ,  pexels is one of my favorite sites ever
 web developer and same .
 i’ve seen many of the same photos i use for websites in random articles online .
 but honestly it’s so much better than those cringe stock photos .
 if i see one more damn “picture of a keyboard but we put a different word on the return key durr hurr aren’t we clever” i’m going to lose it .
 accidentally broke my old shortwave radio ,  which is depressing .
 there &apos;s shortwave websites ,  but it &apos;s not quite the same ,  plus i think it &apos;s a bad  &apos;season &apos; for shortwave ,  fewer stations are available .
 tbh i went straight to iceland after recently watching fire saga and landed on reykjavik .
 the music that was playing was 
 you know you can save comments right ?
 til car seats can expire ,  good to know lol
  &apos;a whole-ass grandfather clock &apos;
 seems like it &apos;s for large cities as i looked at the last 2 cities i lived in (about 225k and 275k) and one had 5 items and the other had none .
  tried my cousin &apos;s city of 65k and no items either .
 50 skeins of baby yarn .
 how many babies did they have to shear to get enough to make that much yarn ?
 that is so wholesome
 as an avid crocheter ,  this warms my heart .
 kanopy has so much great content .
 and hoopla is another free book ,  comic ,  music and movie app .
 i &apos;m sad because my library isn &apos;t on kanopy .
 it looks awesome .
 my library prints a running total of how much you have saved by borrowing books on your checkout slip .
 (this is just for hard copies ,  not ebooks .
 i’ve saved a lot more by checking out ebooks ,  too) .
 i think it may work in some other countries like canada and uk ,  probably depends on your specific library .
 that &apos;s a great site ,  i even submitted some old games that i couldn &apos;t find anywhere else on the internet .
 same but my math minor !
 it &apos;s great for kids who want to put in the time to get a clear understanding but many of us don &apos;t want to put the time in at that age .
 op accepted his own answer ,  saying  &apos;never mind ,  i fixed it &apos; ,  and never came back .
 you need 100 reputation to mark an answer as duplicate
 i am also a developer .
 i understand that they’re trying to keep their site from getting cluttered up by people asking the same questions ,  but they’re so militant and aggressive about it that i’m too intimidated to ask questions directly
 i &apos;ve found that true with every tech site .
 usually someone replies with something along the lines of  &apos;why don &apos;t you just search for the answer .
  &apos; and the answer to that question is  &apos;because every time i search for the answer ,  the only results i get are the same question with responses from assholes saying  &apos;why don &apos;t you just search for the answer .
 now watch as i bookmark this with all the other tools i &apos;ll eventually use in the future but never actually so much as look at after this one time
 they’re only free .
 by paying for them .
 i need a t-shirt of this .
 thanks for mentioning this .
 i feel many will not know about attribution .
 how does one that comes across somewhere that doesn’t attribute properly go about notifying the website about it ?
 logomaker actually uses thenounproject &apos;s icons via their api .
 would you say they’ll be on .
 i used to love librivox .
 there was this one kid who did a bunch of sherlock holmes reads and he tried to do a fake english accent .
 it hurt so bad .
 i couldn’t stand it .
 i love librivox .
 i listened to great expectations off of this for school because i couldn’t get myself to just read it normally .
 big thank you to the guy that did the recording ,  mark smith from south carolina ,  whoever he is .
 one thing that &apos;s great about librivox is that you can find titles with multiple different readers .
 so if you start a book and the reader doesn &apos;t jive with you ,  you can try a another entry .
 additionally ,  if you really love a book ,  you can often listen to several people read it to you in different ways .
 not that i &apos;ve listened to five different readings of jane eyre or anything !
 imslp is a huge resource ,  love it and use it tons !
 i am just realizing this exists .
 a few days after paying them $110 .
 i’m a cpa/auditor and can confirm that i know absolutely nothing about taxes
 yes  a credit karma user here !
 i loved it super easy .
 wow so that’s means no more free service ?
 being a computer science major i’ll just mess around finding work arounds
 so instead of social media your constantly checking on your tree
 are they accredited ?
 600 for a class ain &apos;t bad if i can knock it out in 2 months and still get credits to transfer
 that is fantastic !
  i know that certain edx courses offer certificates (altho you usually have to pay) .
  i think this might be what you are referring to .
  either way ,  i am so stoked that you took advantage of online learning .
 i love me some local libraries .
 i didn &apos;t realize about the movies .
  i knew you could check out dvds for free (but you have to go in to check them out) .
 my favorite thing is checking out puzzles ,  but not all libraries offer that .
  and i always thought seeds were great too (you check them out ,  grow your veggies and replace with new seeds out of the veggies you grew) - but not many libraries have seeds .
  so basically ,  you can grow a garden for free .
 and high school .
 and middle school .
 honestly khan academy is the best
 you made a rhyme
 my 3 year old loves this !
 i &apos;m amazed i found such a high quality free game with endless content .
 10/10 would recommend to any parent of young kids .
 i use krita for drawing and gimp/paint .
 net for photoshop
 a sea of infinite chimps typing away at infinite typewriters given an infinite amount of time will eventually recreate the entire works of shakespeare ,  find your social security number and answer life &apos;s most advanced questions .
 they could also type banana to infinity and beyond .
 whatever floats their chimp boats .
 hitfilm is what i have used pretty much since i started video editing .
 it &apos;s worked awesomely for me for the last 3 years .
 i &apos;m a huge supporter of hitfilm ,  it &apos;s more than an editing software and is basically free premiere / after effects rolled into one program .
 sure ae is more powerful in some areas ,  but most things i do in ae are also possible in hf .

 the july 25 2005 link just goes back to my feed .
 can you link the iphone thread here ?
 it &apos;s going to take a really impressive phone for anyone to give a damn at this point .
 not just on reddit ,  but that was the general theme in the tech press and from the major players .
 palm &apos;s ceo at the time basically scoffed and mocked apple &apos;s attempt to  &apos;break into this market with established players &apos; .
 two years later palm was spoofing apple &apos;s usb vendor id in order to make the pre sync with itunes because they fired all of their app developers through shrinkage and had no proper software division any more .
 microsoft realized they profit more by having as many people as possible use their product instead of charging for it outright .
 you &apos;re the product .
 you can use any win7/8 key iirc
 take with advil .
 this will hurt your head .
 i love spacetime !
 i mean i &apos;m sure its super dumber down but i can still come away with a basic understanding of particle physics and some quantum mechanics without all the math .
 flight aware is what i use .
 i’m flight crew .
  well i used to be back before covid .
 i have used it to decide whether or not i can watch a movie with my parents without them getting in a huff about sex/violence/language gone too far lol
 you know why was it deleted ?
 it shows being logged into flickr when i click on it too .
 also don &apos;t have a flickr .
 not sure what &apos;s up with that .
 also don &apos;t have a flickr .
 seems like they want us to use no script .
  it also showed me logged into facebook and i &apos;m not .
 not entirely sure ,  try googling it
 just create multiple partitions on a disk .
 or setup kvm/qemu and run them in vm &apos;s
 japanese or slap ya knees
 it’s just so his boss knows he’s still at work
 does anyone know how they assign the words ?
 i think the idea is that it &apos;s easier to communicate and remember three words rather than coordinates .
  confused but super interested .
 it’s a great channel ,  i have a cop friend that learnt how to plant weapons from it
 that moment you see a youtube ad on someone else &apos;s machine and you wonder wow ,  life must suck waiting 5secs to click skip 
 i can honestly say that it changed my internet life .
 exit stage right .
 honestly ,  i don’t know where you are .
 i dont even remember using that site
 i don &apos;t think she &apos;s behind project genesis .
 the papers are stored in libgen ,  though .
  &apos;hi university ,  pay me a lot of money to access the articles your researchers and professors wrote &apos; .
 fuck elsevier ,  fuck jstor ,  fuck all the others .
 corporate reddit deleted them for their assets sake valid reasons .
 pm me if you guys want the comments i saved them .
 jesus i got like 40 replies and 30 pm &apos;s .
 for some reason i cant reply to the replies on my comment so please pm me for the comments instead thanks !
 edit 2: looks like i can no longer pm you guys .
 all the messages fail to send .

 is there still anything on shortwave ?
 i got one a few years back ,  and it was pretty sparse ,  mostly just the sort of religious and political- &apos;news &apos; whackadoo stuff that nobody would let onto a proper station .
 (i haven &apos;t used it much lately ,  because there was a radio tower near my house that drowned out everything .
 play jaja ding dong !
 would you like to see a pic ?
 the guy built it from a kit in 1979 .
 he &apos;s now a master violin maker .
 he was giving the clock away because they were  &apos;downsizing &apos; from 10 , 000 sq ft to 5 , 000 sq ft and didn &apos;t have a proper space for it .
 cant tell you how many documentaries i &apos;ve already watched since covid 19 started .
 helpful hint; you can use several library cards in your name to get more watches .
 i use my los angeles public library card as well as my los angeles county library card .
 i don &apos;t know how they &apos;re different but i get a total of 19 free allowances a month !
 then find a library that is .
 lots of places you can get library cards/numbers without living there .
 how much have you saved so far ?
 adding to this ,  if you have a library ,  the librarians often know free services avalible to you; or if your library has a website ,  the site will often have a libby or overdrive link/icon :) .
 also you can just buy membership to some libraries ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about buying a year membership to one of the bigger libraries in my state because they have a vast collection of electronic knitting patterns and their audiobook collection is vastly superior
 hahaha cheers to that
 i am a postman and would like to know the shortest route to follow to reach all my stops .
 thanks for all the serious replies but i was referencing the travelling salesman which is not a solvable problem .
 i am in fact neither a salesman nor a postman really .
 i &apos;ll always be a big fan of  &apos;how many calories are in a cubic lightyear of whipped cream ?
 during my first 2 years of university like 8 ago i think ,  i used wolfram alpha a lot ,  at that time it was very basic but still powerful ,  thank you for your service
 yup ,  co2 ,  h2o ,  and sodium acetate
 removed because answer is easily available at multiple sources / question too basic .
 also the top and only relevant google search hit leads to this page .
 entire page of google results that &apos;s nothing but knock off pages that scraped stackoverflow &apos;s content to present it without the means to ask questions back .
 this triggers nightmares .
 my record is 3 duplicate questions that all link to one another and the only solution was  &apos;i figured it out &apos; with no explanation .
 what’s the exchange rate between karma and rep ?
 and they err far on the side of duplicate .
 i had someone yesterday mark my question as duplicate because it had the same answer was the same ( &apos;no you can &apos;t do it &apos; basically) .
 it &apos;s worst in the rust community .
 questions have to be perfect to be acceptable .
 there &apos;s one guy in particular who lives on stackoverflow and edits almost every question .
 very annoying to have everything you write receive unsolicited copy editing .
 unfortunately stackoverflow has no way to block people .
 the trick is to have two accounts .
  you post the question on your first account ,  and then on your second account you completely make up a bullshit answer .
 someone will immediately correct you and tell you you &apos;re wrong because and then they tell you the real answer .
   their power is mighty ,  but you must know how to wield it .
 the kind of website i bookmark and abandon for 10 years and when i finally need it the link is dead
 exactly ,  that was the plan all along .
 yes ,  but they are there in case you need them in an icon emergency .
 in the words of mr .
 krabs ,  “now offering a free soda for the price of 3 .
 you can send them an email ,  but i imagine there &apos;s not a whole lot anyone can do about it .
 i found about 20 of my icons  &apos;stolen &apos; and listed on some russian  &apos;free icon dump &apos;  website .
 upsetting ,  but that &apos;s the nature of online images .
 honestly i think that &apos;s charming
 listing libgen as a  &apos;free thing on the internet &apos; is like listing thepiratebay or popcorn time .
 this is exactly what the patriot act episode is about .
 yeah i had to file a 1099 so ended up paying that too .
 does this mean when people like me come in with no idea what we &apos;re doing ,  you don &apos;t judge us ?
 i &apos;m always so worried getting my stuff done .
 i keep tax records from every job i &apos;ve ever had ,  every savings bond cashed ,  car sale ,  all of it ,  copies of all my w2s ,  it &apos;s all organized education claims etx .
 i get so overwhelmed with it all that i just see a cpa and have them do it and i always feel like i &apos;m being judged for not know what &apos;s going on ,  but like no one says anything mean im just sure these math people are going  &apos;hah this one can &apos;t adult either ,  &apos; when i &apos;m not looking .
 i mean the company that owns turbo tax certainly isn’t going to keep letting that be free anymore .
 earlier me thinks he &apos;s so smart .
 i got to the point where i got my network to enable permissions that disabled the task manager within the extensions menu .
 i can &apos;t even disable the extension with shift + escape in chrome .
 but oh man ,  stay focused is hilarious because it knows when you &apos;re trying to mess with it .
 they have a certification program but your school may not accept it .
 my experience with edex and coursera is that you can learn a lot but the assessments are usually small quizzes/ maybe a project and are not as intensive as university classes .
 i did not use anything for credit but for coursera you can audit for free and go through several classes quickly .
 it &apos;s been really useful .
 since the other reply wasn &apos;t quite clear ,  no ,  edx and all the other mooc sites are not accredited .
 if you look carefully ,  you may find universities willing to take an edx certificate since it is a port of a class from an actual accredited school ,  but the value of edx is for resume building and personal growth ,  not getting a diploma .
 as /u/kibaeatstrash pointed out ,  they do offer some individual courses that carry the accreditation from the original university ,  and if you &apos;re just looking for a few credits ,  that can serve your purpose .
 it &apos;s only for those specific courses though ,  not the whole site .
 oh yeah ,  my library has a seed library ,  which is super cool .
 other libraries might have a library of things where you can check out telescopes ,  appliances ,  toys ,  games ,  instruments ,  baking dishes or whatever else they might have in their collection .
 and it &apos;s all free !
 i wish it had been around when i was in middle and high school .
 i used it in grad school .
 and i still use it sometimes in my job as a data scientist .
 my 4yo has been using it at least 3-4 times a week when i want her to have some  &apos;school &apos; time after her usual 30 minute  &apos;classes .
  &apos; better than russian barbie cosplay youtube videos while dad is working
 it was the best of times ,  it was the blurst of times ?
 it &apos;s because you are in 2005 .
 wake up u/sin_of_the_dark  .
 so they charge $0 ,  but make it up in volume !
 you can disable a decent bit of it with shutup10
 well if you haven &apos;t seen john wick yet ,  you will definitely want to look that one up first .
 yeah it &apos;s saying i &apos;m also logged into flickr and blogger (which i &apos;ve never even heard of) .
 i took advantage of this stuff in highschool ,  super useful if you don &apos;t want your parents to know .
 german or get rid of the vermin
 i dont ,  assuming its randomly set
 i remember just signing up for an account in a hurry because i had an infographic due in a few hours that i didn &apos;t start on yet .
 i ended up using good old google drawings anyway .
 scums wouldn &apos;t even pay to review the damn papers .
 i seriously got no idea how we are letting this business model stand(last time i heard ,  they are worth billions) .
 they are basically getting paid from all the sides for what ?
 running a plagerism checker and hosting few pdfs on a server ?
 it always infuriates me how much of information and knowledge is being put behind walls while they should be freely available to all .
 especially when the people who actually did the damn work want it to be that way .
 really wtf is going on ?
 is adobe hurt peple don &apos;t want to pay them $1000 to edit a couple of photos ?
 wtf is happening to this website
 they have a beginner friendly version and an advanced version .
 net ,  if you &apos;ve ever used ms paint ,  you &apos;ve used the less sophisticated version of paint .
 emailed this to myself in case it gets deleted again :-d
 i ,  a different person ,  would like to see a pic
 over 2 , 000 dollars in the last 18 months .
 we &apos;re heavy library users and download maybe 8 ebooks a month ,  plus physical books .
 then if you throw in the free language learning software ,  the online classes ,  and the reader talks ,  its probably closer to 5 , 000 .
 yes ,  libby didn’t work for my library so i went to their website .
 they use cloudlibrary ,  another cool app .
 no way i would have passed physical chemistry or differential eq &apos;s without wolfram teaching me where i fucked up the math lol .
 lol well good thing you are not a travelling salesman because that dude has been giving some problems to people that are working with graphs
 just don &apos;t put too much in cause then it &apos;ll stop reacting and it will taste like shiet .
 but i guess you could always add tiny splash of hydrochloric acid to get rid of the excess baking soda ?
 sodium acetate is the flavoring that used for  &apos;salt and vinegar &apos; .
  sodium (from the sodium bicarbonate/baking soda) gets attached to the acetate (from the acetic acid/vinegar) and leaves you with both flavors in one molecule .
  it &apos;s pretty neat !
 also the top and only relevant google search hit leads to this page .
 i forget i bookmarked it and proceed to spend the next three hours finding cool icons just to come across the same link and attempt to bookmark it again .
 did turbo tax change their layout to make it more confusing or something ?
 i started doing freefile 3 or 4 years ago and it was easy to find ,  and now turbotax just automatically takes me there when i login every year .
 there’s two main types of public accounting: audit and tax .
 tax cpa’s deal with individual and business taxes .
 i can assure you that none of them are judging you ,  it’s their job to help people with their taxes .
 if they expected people to know what to do ,  they wouldn’t have a job .
 i’m a cpa but an auditor .
 companies pay our public accounting firm to come in and go through their finances to ensure that all is in place and advise them .
 just like tax accountants ,  we are not there to judge .
 we are there to help and provide a service that betters their company in the long term .
 the running joke though ,  is that auditors are constantly asked by people to do their taxes .
 auditors know as much about taxes as a football player knows how to play soccer .
 same goes for tax accountants with audit .
 i agree with how useful edx can be ,  but as a side note ,  offering a certification program and being accredited are not the same .
 the certification is just the company saying we confirm you took the course .
 accreditation (in an academic context) is the confirmation by an independent authority that a school can legitimately confer degrees (and that therefore credits earned at the institution should transfer) .
 a school has no obligation to grant you a transfer credit based on an edx certificate since edx hasn &apos;t gotten that outside confirmation that their classes meet the academic standards of a university class .
 how do you use khan academy for data science ?
 i am an aspiring data scientist so i am curious to see how you use it
 the man writes so steadily and perfectly with a computer mouse art tool .
 oh lord please let this be true
 well ,  in fact i watched it but i prepared mentally by reading how it was depicted .
 in that case i found the death effective because i most definitely would go on a killing spree if someone hurt one of my cats haha .
 finnish or your finished
 what was the deleted comment ?
 proper moderation in r/askreddit my ass .
 they let every shitty repost slip ,  ignore hatespeech including sexism and racism ,  but delete a comment showing links to freeware ?
 the fact alone that the same 9 users are moderators in most of the popular subreddits is an indicator that they aim to suppress some information contrary to their (economical) interests .
 casual corporate censorship .
 what takes government bureaucracies months to accomplish due to the legal system ,  corporate flakkies and bots can accomplish in two clicks .
 yeah ,  screenshotted in case of reddit bullshit .
 don’t forget about movies !
 redbox is cheap ,  but i always forget to return them the next day ,  and the late fees start adding up .
 at least if i have late fees at the library ,  i feel like i’m helping a good cause along with my penalty !
 yeah i actually paid for a year just to see the steps to the answers and i &apos;m learning more from than than my textbook .
 i still use wolfram for my postdoc haha
 this is what ruined coding for me .
 having a deadline creep up to you while this extremely toxic coding community seems absolutely determined in making your assignment a misery is not what i expected .
 thank god i dont  have to deal with that anymore ,  i did gain tons of respect for those who are good at it though .
 coding genuinely challenges your intellect and is by far not for everyone .
 ah ,  infinite exchange ,  both directions
 yea they deliberately obfuscate it
 watch the episode he talks about exactly this in it .
 oh haha no ,  i &apos;m definitely seeing a cpa !
 my old one ,  a friend of the family ,  retired and referred me to the new people .
 they &apos;re great and they helped sort out my husband &apos;s five years of not filing .
 so they &apos;re angels .
 i &apos;m just afraid i look dumb cause numbers are super not my thing and i kind of think you &apos;re all wizards if i &apos;m being honest .
 i usually ring them cookies or a cheesecake as a thank you cause man i do not want to learn to do this shit myself .
 there are only 5 courses on coursera which are accredited iirc .
 you can check them out .
 few by colorado boulder too but credits aren &apos;t much .
 8 or something so if you &apos;re looking to boost your gpa while doing ms or bs it might help .
 they usually mention this .
 he’s using a wacom tablet and pen with autodesk sketchbook .
 it blows my mind how good his handwriting is with that thing .
 you &apos;ve been waiting for two years to reply to someone who randomly writes that number ?
 yeah ,  after i wrote that i thought the same thing .
 like ,   &apos;damn ,  if only &apos;
 microsoft is a hardware/software company .
 they make money by selling hardware and software .
 they find that they make more money when windows is free because then you end up spending money on things like office 365 ,  or onedrive .
 they’re called “complementary goods” .
 it’s the same reason they offer 4 free xbox games every month: they want people on their platforms so they spend money on more things .
 if you want to be paranoid (and justifiably) about companies selling your data ,  look to google and facebook .
 their entire business model is dependent on selling your data to advertisers .
 microsoft and apple might be guilty of that as well to some degree ,  but they’ve got cleaner records historically and have incentives to protect your data instead of selling it .
 “complementary” ,  not “complimentary” .
 french or i hit you with a bench
 swedish if you &apos;re feeling peevish
 there was comment listing some open source software programs ,  including gimp ,  among others
  &apos;you won &apos;t have a calculator in real life &apos; they said .
 little did they know that some madlad would make an internet calculator that can do literally any equation and shows you the working too .
 makes sense then:
 to everyone confused in the comments ,  867-5309 (jenny) is a song from 1981 .
 don &apos;t you mean  &apos;complementary goods &apos; ?
 cause excel has never given me any positive comment on my looks
 chinese or bye niece
 i realized that from the copy paste and edits he does .
 btw sketchbook is free even if you don’t have a tablet .
 well then maybe you really are non-attractive because mine does it all the time .
 i mean ,  i use google sheets ,  but i &apos;ve always assumed it was all the same
 if someone created a website ,  with links to these websites ,  that would be the best website .
 10minutemail ,  no need to use my own email to read a random website .

 if you’re a university student and you need access to paid online journals this is the website .
 you put in the doi of the journal and it gives you the access to that journal .
 good website ,  really helpful for my studies .
  this whole thread is the best thing i’ve come across on reddit in years .
 its actually a browser extention but its fun being able to have movie night with the boys while on lockdon
 well idk if this truly fits here because in iceland we use it a lot and you kinda need to be icelandic to get the full experience .
 it &apos;s called islendingabok .
 is and basically it &apos;s a big family tree .
 iceland can see who their ancestors are and who you are related to because we kept such good trace that we can see who are ancestors are all the way to back when we hadn &apos;t found iceland .
 it &apos;s very fun to see how closely related you are to your friends .
 oh and many also check it before hook ups just to make sure that you aren &apos;t doing incest xd if you are 5 generations apart you are fine .
 we don &apos;t see that as your relative .
 i am very lucky that i an 8 and 9 generations apart from my gf .
 then again it wouldn &apos;t matter as much since we are both girls .
 most of my friends are 7 generations away from me .
 oh and one thing i discovered with this is that i have a famous ancestor !
 she was famous for being kidnapped by pirates and turned into a slave but then she was able to get back home .
 her name is guðrún  tyrkjagoð .
 the drug community knows about this one .
 this website is the still one of the best websites for unbiased information about recreational drugs .
 this site has literally saved lives .
 thanks for the silver and also correcting me on the web address !
 se removes pay walls for most scientific articles because scientific progress should not be restricted by means .

 i think i will do a spreadsheet of these websites if this comment gets enough upvotes/interest .
 i got my first ever reddit award !
 also ,  spreadsheet is now in the works .
 will post as soon as i can .
 giving myself a deadline of january 15 (cuz work and real life ,  ya know) .
 database for books ,  magazines ,  etc .
 i found about 75% of my textbooks there while in college .
 a website that provides free textbooks for basically all your first year college courses (some second year courses too !
 they are run by the prestigious rice university .
 modern states has legit online courses for your whole first year of college .
 you simply take the courses on your own time ,  pair it with the textbooks from openstax ,  and when you &apos;re done with a course ,  apply for a clep exam voucher (or pay out of pocket if you want ,  they &apos;re only about $60 each) ,  take the clep ,  if you pass your university gives you credit for that course .
 you can complete your first year of college for free (or really cheap) and on your own time ,  legitimately .
 and of course khanacademy .
 org for those who need help understanding certain topics or just wanting to learn a whole subject on their own time .
 the stardew valley wiki .
 wish i knew about all these websites when i was finishing school lmao
 free rice(free rice) .
  every one you answer provides food for impoverished people .
  if you &apos;re going to sit and waste time on your computer at least you can help feed people .
 i use it for graphs
 me: saving every link
 free knowledge for all !
 i just found ground news .
 you plug in a link to a news article ,  and it provides you with articles from left ,  neutral ,  and right media sources on the topic ,  so you can see evidence and perspectives from each side .
 just allows me to hear all sides on news stories so i xan try to form less biased opinions ,  avoid echochambering ,  and at least be educated on both sides of things .
 i have political biases still ,  but i’m firm beleiver in knowing what the other side thinks ,  even if i vehemently disagree .
 they have an app and a chrome extension ,  so i just plug in links from articles i come across on news sources or twitter ,  and go from there .
 super convenient and free .
 finally i can read 80% of the answers in r/askhistorians
 this thread sponsored by people without kids .
 people without kids:  &apos;life is just easier that way .

 wow thanks useful for escorts
 i miss the site stumbleupon .
 it is basically this thread but more organized
 as someone taking multiple epilepsy meds ,  this is amazing .
 keppra often has a side effect that basically causes language issues that result in a tip of my tongue kind of problem .
 better than a thesaurus i guess .
 not only is my edition terrible ,  it &apos;s also terrible .
 might be helpful if i ever go into the office again
 this is incredible .
 i can &apos;t work out if this is calming or anxiety inducing due to never being able to actually clear that inbox .
 okay ,  i can do reddit now inside office .
 if you get ninite installer ,  do not remove it !
 you can use it to install updates to all of your ninite installed programs .
 i added it to my grandpa &apos;s laptop and said:  &apos;click this in a once on a while and it will update your programs &apos;
 fucking ridiculous i scrolled this far down to find ninite .
 perfect for unshitting your computer with a clean reinstall .
 yep ,  i mainly use online tools for small photo edits ,  remove .
 bg is what helped me make a new photograph required for my school application ,  while others went to actual studios ,  i just modified my selfie .
 flipping awesome thank you
 well ,  that beats the hell out of using image search and getting paywalled at every promising looking sheet .
 worth checking out cpdl if you need choral music .
 often better than imslp .
 all classical musicians i know use this website ,  it &apos;s saved my ass so many times
 this is what a majority of my school uses
 i use it when i have a lot of reading assignments for college and i don &apos;t have time to really get to them all but i want to listen to a reading while i clean or something
 there &apos;s a chrome extension that does the same thing after highlighting text and right clicking it
 on mobile ,  so not formatting links ,  but some other text-to-speech options  .
 central access reader from central wa uni .
 reads docx files or you can paste into car .
 let &apos;s you export as mp3 .
 built in mathml library for reading mathml .
 balabolka - exports to mp3 ,  reads word ,  pdf ,  and epub .
 thorium - epub reader with built in tts .
 office lens- take a picture of text and listen or send it to cloud storage/ word online .
 immersive reader is built into most ms products now .
 speechify - haven &apos;t used this one but been recommended to me .
 readaloud - browser ext .
 built into edge ,  available on chrome and firefox .
 colorveil - adds a color tint to your screen to help with eye strain .
 mathpix - take a picture / snip of math and convert to latex or mathml .
 mac has lots of accessibility features built in ,  look up mac tts or mac accessibility .
 the chrome extension keepa adds this functionality directly onto the amazon product pages .
 i &apos;ve saved a lot of money by seeing items that regularly go on sale .
 real example: the insta pot duo nova ,  regularly $100 but i noticed it went to $50 twice the last 3 months .
 i waited a few days and now sure enough it &apos;s $50 again .
 it used to let you past paywalls for nyt and washington post too but that hasn &apos;t been working for me for a little while .
 this one sounds interesting
 domain gets blocked by some websites ,  i use mailpoof .
 i use these all the time .
 they help so much in keeping my daily inbox cleaner
 i use a similar website called yepmail to avoid spam mails .
 it also has an option to choose how long the email will be valid(an hour to a few days)
 it &apos;s great to make a new reddit account .
 always a good idea to make a new one every few months cause you don &apos;t realize how much info you give out over time .
 had a dude guess what area i lived in the city based off shit i &apos;ve commented .
 it &apos;s very accurate
 damn ,  i thought this was some sort of vast candy exchange network .
 so i can send my 3-4min video play throughs of songs to my band mate without taking forever to upload to googledrive or dropbox ?
 sounds like something someone related to that website would say
 im always looking for this type of resource for movies for my kid !
 thanks for the link !
 i have been looking for a site like this for the last few days ,  thank you !
 compare the cost of living/salaries in different countries .
 i looked up japan and the first thing i heard is a song in english
 is there a website that allows me to send an email to past me ?
  i &apos;ve got a couple of things i need to warn me about .
 this one could be so good or so bad .
 you can always use gmail to send an email in the future too but gmail did not have this function when this website was created .
 i used this for over 8 years and it really made me feel good whenever i saw an email of myself in the past .
 i send myself goals and encouragement to help me keep in mind what &apos;s important .
 this one is my favorite .
 i’ve written maybe 150 letters over the course of 4 years- anywhere from 1 month to 10 years in the future .
 i love this one .
 i’m in a web design course and the prof recommended it :)
 good luck to spain i guess
 i find this site very soothing .
  it &apos;s also cool to see a strike on the map and then hear the thunder a couple of seconds later .
 anyone mind explaining how this actually works ?
 of the mints i &apos;ve used it i never thought of that .
 unfortunately there &apos;s no screaming
 ah ,  a coffee shop on fire !
 why was this so hard to find before now ?
 we can be best friends :)
 and it’s integrated with spotify !
 ah ,  the transitions are to similar musical styles .
 at first i thought it was about featured artists in collaborations
 was very confused as to how a playlist was going to connect keith haring to van gogh before i realized you meant music artists haha
 photopea is excellent .
 for those curious ,  it has the absolute best psd file support of any non-adobe product i &apos;ve been able to find (yes ,  better psd support than gimp or affinity) .
 everyone who doesn’t need super high photoshop levels use this .
 it has most of the features of adobe photoshop ,  and is probably the best discovery i have ever made on the internet (other than davinci resolve editing software)
 does anyone know of a tutorial on how to use this program ?
 i &apos;m very interested in photoshop but i have tried photopea before and struggled using it .
 i don &apos;t have any history with photoshop so i would be starting from square one .
 this is the best thing i’ve seen all day
 you know most of the time when they say ‘it’s broken’ ,  it’s because someone didn’t clean it out or want to clean it .
 stéphane is the best !
 i can &apos;t speak highly enough of this site .
 i find the tap-tempo in fl works pretty nicely .
 blockchain “turning point” sometime between 2023-2027 ?
 silver is going to “run out” by 2029 ?
 hm those might be actionable long term investment cues .
 thanks for giving me existential crisis 
 used to work for a ceo with his own jet .
 actually quite amazing the stock predictions an investor could have intuited just by seeing when/where that jet flew .
 flightradar24 is the one thing that almost always helps me with flight anxiety .
 knowing that at any moment there are damn near thousands of flights at any moment and they are all landing safely 99 .
 also ,  the fact there are several flights that are going ,  or just went through the same path my plane is and they are flying safely .
 sites like this remind me of why the internet was invented .
 this still wasn &apos;t created from where i came ,  thanks !
 holy shit ,  i just tried it and it said 2020 !
 this site is legit ,  guys .
 this site looks amazing ,  thank you so much !
 i use this site all the time .
 most recently for setting up my shortcuts in ios 14 for that “aesthetic” look .
 i have also used it quite a bit for work and personal projects .
 a little recollection recoloring and arrangement makes for great understated impact on boring powerpoint slides .
 is there a version of this for movies ?
  a knights tale has one of the coolest wardrobes i &apos;ve ever seen in a movie .
 i used this one time after my gf saw an actress wearing some pajamas on a show .
  i looked them up ,  something like $800 .
 just checked the good place link .
  no men &apos;s clothing : (
 hmm can &apos;t seem to find the mandalorian &apos;s outfit .
 oooh thank you for this .
 i was grounded all the time growing up so i read and still read more than consume digital media .
 which means i fuck up pronouncing words in my native language with embarrassing frequency .
 those seven people are out of this world
 there are a lot more flight engineers than i expected in space
 bear in mind you &apos;re trusting a random website with your document ,  so think twice before sending it anything sensitive .
 when avengers:endgame came out at 3 hours long my local theater had signs posted saying things like “at 43 minutes in ,  thor says ‘hello everybody’ .
 you have 5 minutes and 23 seconds before the next important moment” .
 that &apos;s fucking hilarious .
 i feel like you forgot to add  &apos;in the theater &apos; not just any time of the day to pee lol
 keep scrolling ,  or go to new comments .
 there’s a couple more threads just like this linked ,  but twice as long .
 a rabbit hole worth going down for sure .
 wolfram also recognizes units .
 so if i need to find the keplerian orbital period of a celestial body ,  but i have separation in miles and mass in stones ,  i can still easily ask for my period in fortnights !
 no converting units by hand !
 i use it for all sorts of things .
 even weather and temperature forecasts .
 i like how they visualise it .
 i got really excited thinking that this was pictures of the real estate agents themselves .
  &apos;the perfect beachside property in which to relive the allied normandy landings of 1944 &apos; .
 can you also use it to stream a movie you own or does it only work with netflix ,  etc .
 i would always research on that site before experimenting as a teenager .
 it really helped me understand what i would be getting into and experiencing beforehand .
 that was almost 20 years ago .
 it &apos;s good that it &apos;s still around .
 the trip reports are really fun to read too ,  especially the bad ones
 yeah ,  the trip reports are ,  incidentally ,  a trip .
  they further convinced me that even considering datura was a bad idea .
  don &apos;t fuck with deliriants ,  kids .
 pair this with thispersondoesnotexist and you have a full catfish
 this is a solid compilation of the free books sites .
 r/piracy should take note .
 tw currently works
 yup ,  was gonna post this if it wasn’t here .
 just used it to road trip from la to seattle to denver through montana/wyoming and back .
 it allowed me to just drive and drive to my heart’s content and reliably find somewhere nearby to park overnight .
 also ,  bureau of land management spots that are remote .
 note: may need 4x4 clearance for many and many are seasonally closed .
 read the reviews for notes on accessibility or cell service or if a site is still free for camping .
 i found tons of great spots and had a blast ,  no major issues using it and only it on that 3 week road trip .
 omfg you’re the best ,  i’m broke to buy any kind of expensive books to self-study in my field .
 i found just the one i’m looking for in archive .
 i owe you a lot
 that website is truly underrated .
 it deserves more attention particularly for pc games .
 when i was a kid my mom used to play diablo ii and chip &apos;s challenge on our computer .
 i didn &apos;t know english back then and then my mom also had some memory loss .
 so the names of those games remained a mystery for me for 17 years until i accidentally discovered that website during this lockdown and saw those games .
 i just remembered ,  my mom used to play bad toys 3d also .
 though i didn &apos;t find it on archive .
 i found it on r/tipofmyjoystick a few months back .
 but it &apos;s also there on archive .
 wow - the grateful dead collection there is stellar
 yeah i was on jimmy kimmel once and the only place the show exists on the internet is on archive .
 i totally didn &apos;t tear up .
 yeah ,  it used to be just a fun place to dick around for fun back when i didn &apos;t make a noise getting up .
 now it &apos;s become essential .
 i’m pretty young and i use urban dictionary all the time .
 it’s hard to keep up with new slang ,  especially when i don’t live in an english speaking country .
 another tip i heard a long time ago is to look at movie credits !
 it keeps names from sounding too over engineered .
 i can imagine the users in the top 10 put their entire life &apos;s worth in reddit points and spend all day on reddit posting and reposting .
 i hope i &apos;m wrong ,  but how else do they accumulate that many points ?
 i love how 3 of the first 5 users ever were  &apos;third &apos;  &apos;fourth &apos; and  &apos;fifth &apos;
 when i was in my mid-teens i got catfished by an older married woman online for a year and a half .
 she &apos;d like ,  mail me photos and handwritten letters ,  a lock of hair tied with a ribbon ,  etc .
 eventually i found out she was lying and she wasn &apos;t who she said she was ,  but i was madly in love for so long ,  but the  &apos;face &apos; tied to my emotions basically wasn &apos;t real - it was a girl who didn &apos;t know me and had no idea of my existence at all .
 it sorta feels like that .
 the person i loved never really existed at all .
 plus you can download music you buy in basically any format you want ,  and more money goes to the artists than with other music stores .
 i buy all my music through bandcamp when it &apos;s available there .
 very underrated and they generally seem to care .
 they’ve given profits to a lot of charities and they’ve recently been giving away their profit share once a month to artists during covid to help support them and actively encouraging people to buy during that period .
 i hope john wick doesn &apos;t discover this site .
 great site for avoiding the really rapey stuff too .
 can i get a serious answer and not made fun of ?
 can this tell me if any babies/young children die ?
 it’s honestly unreal how much i seem to accidentally come across this lately and is putting me off watching anything that a close friend hasn’t watched and can’t tell me if there are any
 it has infinity train ,  been looking for that one for a while .
 i use it frequently to watch covid 19 cases in my country and its top 99 now :)
 i imagine my parents using this ,  forgetting that it told them to press f11 ,  and then going nuts because they can &apos;t get the quiet place off of their screen .
 for anyone wondering what this actually is - it &apos;s a site that seems to be hosting emulators for a lot of classic game consoles .
 honestly ,  i use bing as my main search engine now .
 it &apos;s pretty good overall ,  and google &apos;s ads haven gotten rediculous .
 oh hey ,  your searched for a thing ?
 here &apos;s 5 ads ,  10 videos from youtube ,  2 actual results ,  and another 5 ads .
 google are really shooting themselves in the foot
 at first i was  &apos;why the hell would i use bing ?
  &apos; ,  then it hit me: nobody would ever find my history .
 taps head with finger
 kinda creepy ngl .
 recently read a creepy pasta of a woman seeing her face on that site then the world changed as if she never existed .
 i forget the url ,  but there is a website i’ve played with that generates an entire fake person (as in information ,  not appearance) based on parameters you input .
 specify whatever details you want and suddenly you have a fictitious person with a name ,  birthdate ,  address ,  occupation ,  email ,  and more .
 really neat to mess with .
 and on black friday !
 my christmas shopping is done !
 i might need to check this one out .
 that sounds stupidly illegal but nonetheless pretty interesting
 similarly the terraria wiki and the wikis for mods like calamity
 the purred reich ?
 fuck me ,  i hate when i don’t have my 5 , 000 sided dice on me .
 yes ,  this is an awesome site .
 whenever the powerball lottery payout gets crazy high ,  i always go here to pick numbers .
  of course ,  i don &apos;t actually buy tickets .
 why would i waste my money ?
  but ,  it is nice to be a part of the experience .
 duck duck go has become my regular search engine for that reason
 they are that aggressive at removing posts and comments ?
 well i just tested buff trump lol
 stumbleupon was such an awesome way to kill time back in the day
 first site i’d visit daily .
 that was my first thought !
 i’m only on one epileptic med right now ,  topiramate ,  but it still gets pretty bad sometimes .
 feels weird saying i hope it gets better for you ,  but i don’t know what else to say .
 here &apos;s hoping we never will
 i did not know this and i &apos;ve used ninite for years .
 make sure you search on ducduckgo to find the functioning versions of  scihub ,  zlibrary and also b-ok .
 apparently posting the direct links got the parent comments deleted .
 here are some useful websites to access a wide range of literature ,  including scientific journal papers .
 scihub: specifically good for finding journal papers .
 works best if you paste in doi for the paper .
 bo-k ,  zlibrary: works best for obtaining free copies of books ,  including textbooks ,  standards ,  novels etc
 you just saved me a lot of money with your grad school application tip !
 fucking hell ,  no joke .
 as someone who plays piank and guitar the difficulty in finding good transcriptions on piano is almost impossible ,  but for guitar it &apos;s like a milliom free copies .
 this comment hits way too close to home for me
 basically the same thing .
 but also ,  support authors whenever you can .
 i used to use it for long reports .
 english isn &apos;t my native language and i try to get a listen to my writing to see if it sounds right .
 i stopped using it once i realized my speling is jsut so horibal dat it wuld sound like an alien regurgitating .
 attempted to use keepa until i read the permissions request to allow it to alter personal information including passwords ,  phone numbers and credit card information .
 finally i can get my revenge .
 i will now create many fake emails and use them to spam the inboxes of porn sites
 really like all these recommendations .
 off to go sign up for a free trial of .
 upvote for linguee !
 i do a lot of translations and it helps me find the correct word or phrase in different contexts .
 super useful when words have many uses .
 also great for more technical terms that can be super difficult to translate correctly because it puts them in context .
 i &apos;ve long thought this needs to happen for christmas chocolates .
 one family hates toffees ,  one family hates soft centres ,  they register with the website and ,  come january ,  everyone receives a shipment of delicious leftovers !
 everyone &apos;s happy :-)
 yes indeed ,  but it still depends on your upload bandwidth and you have to keep the webpage open while the other person downloads the file(s) .
 well that &apos;s just useless to me .
 e- yes fellow pervs ,  rise from the bushes ,  make yourselves heard !
 so cool ,  thanks for sharing this !
 i &apos;m kinda embarrassed to admit that i viewed about a dozen windows before my little brain finally caught on that these weren &apos;t live streams (the green foliage in stockholm should &apos;ve given it away on the first video lol) .
 exports their culture like crazy .
 no matter where you go on the world ,  you &apos;ll always find american music ,  films or mcdonald &apos;s .
 as for me ,  the first thing i looked up was some tatar russian radio channel and the first song was some english song by a german band that i &apos;ve never even heard of .
 went to japan last year .
 was in a supermarket across from our hotel getting some juice .
 i start softly singing along with the song playing .
 realised i was singing in english ,  listened to the song .
 it was linkin park .
 had a funny  &apos;wait ,  what ?
 my experience wasn’t ideal - my (now wife) and i had been together for a year or so and sent an email to our future selves about all our hopes and dreams - getting married ,  what jobs we’d have ,  having kids ,  how good a granny her mum would be ,  etc etc .
 silly ,  fun stuff .
 in the intervening years most of my wife’s family had died (including her mum) and after 3 miscarriages we’d just lost our full-term little boy .
 it was a real ‘ouch’ moment .
 i’m sure in different circumstances it’s a great idea but in this case ,  0/10 would not recommend .
 hey ,  looks like you survived champ !
 i used this like 7 years ago .
 the email did not age well .
 whilst boring it’s good to get in the habit of following the image to the uploader account and onto their social media’s .
 loads of stuff under copyright gets loaded up to unsplash by someone other than the original owner .
 for a design course no real stress but down the line it can save some legal pains .
 spain getting rocked right now lol
 breaking: thor has been spotted in spain .
 if you zoom in enough ,  they show a prediction of where the sound wave should be .
 it’s usually off by a second or two but pretty close .
 this one has an android app if you want .
 it’s based on receivers that private citizens have that all feed data back to the host to triangulate the locations based on magnetism as i understand it .

 mynoise is awesome ,  i actually support the person running it since i think the quality of his recordings are top notch .
 i was also expecting a lot of screaming and alarms .
 oh hell yeah ,  that’s awesome
 there is a music genealogy site out there that documents featured artists and covers .
 forget the name now .
 as a graphic designer with nearly 20 years of experience ,  i don’t get the fuss about gimp other than being free .
 it has the worst user interface i’ve seen in any tool i’ve tried .
 davinci resolve is amazing !
 started using it earlier this year .
 is this not present in other software ?
 seems pretty essential
 as for resources running out ,  they &apos;ve taken known easy deposits at our current price level ,  and divided by years .
 the mining compnies are constantly speculating ,  finding new deposits ,  or finding new tech to open up previously thought to be too costly .
 we were told 32 years ago in elementary school that there was like 50 years of petroleum reserves .
 there are still 50 years of petroleum reserves .
 this is a general principle ,  there could actually be a silver shortage ,  just beware media tricks .
 my so is a pilot ,  and his company don &apos;t have their jets listed for this exact reason .

 i’d love to get the shoes rosie wore in jojo rabbit .
 my goodness what a terrific movie .
 i think we in general vastly underestimate just how expensive people wear on shows ,  even supposedly poor characters .
 i looked at an outfit from lisa on younger ,  it was a long skirt with a simple t-shirt and a bag and it was over $3000 .
 t t-shirt alone was like $400 .
 but they did suggest something similar and affordable .
 use the links on the irs website .
 last year i filed in 3 states and federally including student loan interest and stock dividend income for free through h&r block .
 it even managed to figure out part year residence across several states .
 and i didn &apos;t pay anything .
 the iss is getting pretty old ,  so maintenance is becoming more of a priority than research .
 i watched it in india .
 they did the intermission thing like they always do .
 i can &apos;t even begin to tell you how grateful i was for that .
 i used one of these sites and they said  &apos;hawkeye wakes up in the water at around 1:54 .
  &apos; that was both a major spoiler and also made me miss the emotional part that came after that .
 it was useful when theaters were more of a thing
 desmos is amazing ,  it should be worshipped
 cheating in pre-calculus in high school :-)
 if you’re getting your period every two weeks ,  you should see your doctor .
 it was originally created for netflix under that name “netflix watch party” then they added more stuff and rebranded
 as far as i know it only works for streaming services however if you want to stream a movie you own just use discord and stream your video player to the channle .
 yeah when i was a teen in 2011-13 it was still going strong .
 they deserve more donations .
 it definitely stopped me from trying some stupid shit like datura .
 chips challenge holy shit
 a world without spell check is not a world i can survive in .
 i have seen one of the top 10 users repost jokes in comments of hot posts of r/jokes .
 quick way to earn comment karma if that post goes to the top .
  &apos;fourth &apos; is fifth and  &apos;fifth &apos; is fourth
 it has a bunch of different  &apos;triggers &apos; listed on there ,  like if someone ods ,  has alcohol issues ,  whether anyone drowns ,  etc etc
 yes ,  most common triggers are there its such a useful website .
  i’m sorry you were afraid of being mocked .
 i checked - it’s one of the categories you can filter on
 amazon are getting worse too ,  i searched for  simple thing ,  the first 3 things listed were sponsored ,  two items under that was relevant to my search ,  then another couple unrelated items sponsored .
 i just gave up .
 google is getting so terrible about ads these days that i &apos;m seriously thinking about switching .
  duckduckgo would probably be what i &apos;d change to ,  though .
  &apos;why the hell would i use bing ?
 use bing to search for porn and you will see it is vastly superior to google for porn in the results returned and how they are displayed .
 if you want to plant trees ,  use ecosia
 not aggresive really ,  it &apos;s just that their policy is for answers to fill certain criteria .
 but one sees answers that have like 40 upvotes that were deleted by the mods and is like  &apos;i would really like to know what the comment said ,  even if it doesn &apos;t fill the sub criteria completely &apos; .
 does google filter out the results ?
 i &apos;ve found it &apos;s pretty difficult to find direct links to these sites on google ,  but thought it was because they wanted to be unlisted .
 what’s schools are you going to that require you to include a photo of yourself in the application ?
 not in the us ,  i’m guessing ?
 you &apos;re right ,  but i wonder why is that ?
 why is finding classical piano pieces so difficult where guitar pieces ,  there &apos;s a million different tabs and instructions for it .
 makes no sense .
 hapined to mi ,  wanmtad to see hov ny paper sounded ,  endet up lerning klingon
 i think its called  &apos;read aloud &apos;
 yeah - all these browser extensions people recommend induce major side eye in me
 so i just looked and keepa does not requiere any permission on chrome .
 besides ,  you can use it without an extension through its website and thet will send u a mail if any product you are following drops its price .
 it has been pretty useful for me
 i specifically looked at the replies to that comment hoping for an alternative since outline quit working .
 you just gotta sprinkle in some stuff to throw them off .
 i wrote this comment from my blue 2013 hyundai elantra
 do you recall the script you had used ?
 very interested in that
 what a nice person .
 creepy but nice .
 this has nothing at all to do with your post but whoever gave you that award literally gave you the coolest frickin award i’ve ever seen .
 you are literally a saint i love this award thank you so much
 what the fuck ,  thank you internet wizard !
  &apos;your new living room set looks great from the yard .
 my friend lived in the us ,  had a burger king ,  a kfc and a taco bell within walking distance from his apartment .
 now he lives in shanghai ,  and has a burger king ,  a kfc and a taco bell within walking distance from his apartment .
 it &apos;s honestly a bit nuts .
 crawling in the mart !
 these pears ,  they will not peel !
 linkin park is really popular in japan .
 when chris cornell died ,  hybrid theory and meteora both popped up on the japanese billboard 200 for a while .
 pretty high up if memory serves ,  like top ten .
 edit 2: chester bennington ,  not chris cornell ,  my bad .
 their deaths are still so closely connected in my brain .
 you &apos;re finally awake .
 can confirm ,  it was scary
 who even logs these things ?
 i &apos;ll say that i was starting out with it ,  just getting used to drawing digitally and gimp is definitely not beginner friendly .
 the same with inkscape .
 i love that they &apos;re open source ,  but the ui/ux is pretty terrible .
 blender have made huge improvements in that regard relatively recently ,  so hopefully it can happen with gimp/inkscape .
 you’re right on both ,  it’s free (which is why i use it) and the interface is horrible .
 i don’t need it often enough for photoshop to be even remotely worth paying for
 okay ,  that &apos;s actually funny
 rubeo ,  the costume director ,  sketched the shoes then had them custom made for the film .
 since they seem popular ,  there &apos;s probably some knock offs though .
 that scene with the shoes .
 yes ,  amazing movie !
 i always appreciate shows that have poor characters wear cheap clothes and ,  even better ,  wear the same stuff in other episodes and/or seasons .
 raising hope was really good about that .
 i also forget that things are tailored for the actors .
 part of the reason they look so good is because their clothes are made to fit their bodies .
 i rhink it &apos;s an error ,  because they &apos;re all listed as flight engineers
 in the before times
 now that my 400 level math professor sends us desmos calculations ,  i don’t consider it cheating in the slightest .
 it just streamlines the grunt work .
 i still use it to calculate my shit when i &apos;m lazy and i &apos;m 3rd semester of engineering
 i wonder ,  how do they break the drm that netflix and the like use ?
 the datura trainwrecks are all nuts ,  but that &apos;s why you stay the fuck away from jimson weed and deliriants as a whole .
  there &apos;s kind of a famous polysubstance trip report called  &apos;the search for vaginal data points &apos; about 5 women who tried dosing a variety of substances through the devil &apos;s doorway .
 i googled that with caps lock on by accident .
 now my web history makes it look like i really want to try  .
 i use z-lib for all my e books now ,  no idea if it &apos;s legal but it &apos;s free and there are no viruses so it &apos;s a thumbs up from me .
 also ,  happy cake day
 that’s not the issue though .
 the issue is zlib solicits donations when all they do is scrape from libgen .
 just use libgen folks and donate to them not zlib if you are inclined to donate to the project .
 the real trick is to use big subs that hit the front page often and sort by  &apos;rising &apos; or  &apos;top of 1 hour &apos; .
 make a clever ,  funny ,  or insightful reply to one of the top 2 or 3 comments .
 it was really kind of you to respond and show this person how they can find the info .
 thanks for being wonderful !
 my favorite are when they suggest to buy something again ,  but it’s something people only ever need one of .
 yes ,  i bought a coffee pot ,  but i don’t need seven of them ,  amazon .
 please leave me alone .
 the trick is to use both .
 google is good ,  but it shows you stuff it thinks you want to see .
  incognito mode doesn &apos;t help .
 with duckduckgo you sometimes find what you are actually looking for .
 plant trees when you search and it respects your privacy .
 please do check it out .
 yeah ,  google has been until very recently .
  for a while it was linking a url that would redirect you to sci-hub ,  but with ads where the revenue wouldn &apos;t go to the sci-hub creator
 pretty much all universities in hungary require a photo of the applicant ,  i dont know why
 i really don &apos;t know .
 maybe because tabs are easier to write than note sheets ?
 i do find tabs to be a bit more straight to the point ,  whereas sheetmusic has 101 things to consider when hitting that one note .
 i remember someone attempting to do some tab version for piano with each octave as a certain number ,  so central c would be smt like c4 but i don &apos;t think it works as well as with tabs .
 with tabs you can almost play what you see .
 therefore the amount of amateurs and intermediates writing tabs might be significantly higher than piano players at the same level doing the same thing ?
 that &apos;s too obvious .
 you don &apos;t need that with website trackers like camelcamelcamel or even just price history on some sites like fakespot .
 so yeah ,  i &apos;d definitely stay away from most of these extensions .
 1) make many fake emails .
 2) spam the inboxes of porn sites .
 my horse jimmy who is currently on my farm in des moines ,  ia thinks this joke is hilarious .
 i have to go get my laptop charger from my black 2017 bmw series 3 .
 beer is how i fall ,  using milk with cereal
 i might try it again - see how far we go in the next 5 or 10 years .
 i’m sure it’ll be happier next time around .
 might use this site just to send that message to myself
 you were trying to cross the border ,  right ?
 a lot of images on pixabay are pirated .
 always do a search on shutterstock for the image plus a reverse image search for it .
 same goes for pexels and unsplash ,  but they &apos;re better about removing stolen content ,  pixabay is rife with it .
 it’s a hobby for people .
 they build stations for it and share data on a server and it’s really interesting how it works .
 if you search for  &apos;blitzortung sensor &apos; then you can find people assembling the sensor kit .
 blitzortung is the main project of the lighting detection - lightningmaps is website that people can find on google :d
 yeah gimp wasn &apos;t designed for drawing from what i &apos;ve heard .
 the closer open source equivalent for digital art is krita .
 also backdating is so important ,  most people are not in a position to change their entire outfit every single year .
 3rd year technologist ,  can confirm symbolab and wolfram saved lives this year .
 everyone in the party has to have their own account .
 it just syncs them up and adds a chat box .
 everyone needs a netflix account .
 everyone has to have access to the thing you &apos;re trying to watch (i .
 e ,  you can &apos;t stream something that &apos;s only available in the us to your friend in the uk (unless they have a vpn of course)) .
 all it &apos;s doing is syncing you all up and adding a chat (which you can close) .
 you &apos;re all still watching it on your own devices .
 this is difference to rabbit for example (which was similar) ,  since only one person was streaming the content for everyone else .
 with teleparty/netflix party ,  everyone is streaming it on their own netflix ,  it &apos;s just being streamed at the same time for everyone .
 i had forgotten the name of this but luckily the comment section helped out ,  thanks !
 sorry ,  just reminiscing about our search engine options in the  &apos;90s
 usually ,  it’s race based discrimination
 double checked ,  that &apos;s the one ,  lol
 if i know only one thing in life ,  it’s that we shouldn’t make a sentient flamethrower upset .
 he &apos;s just full of hot air .
 that’s enough for me
 beat the shit out of myself with the brick for being that dumb 
 say  &apos;hey ,  what &apos;s red and bad for your teeth ?
  &apos; and when they open their mouths to say something hit them in the face with the brick .
 paint a stick figure on it ,  call it a bansky ,  and sell it for $2 million like the first guy should have done .
 write supreme on it 
 sell it on ebay as  &apos;the brick from that reddit thread &apos; and hopefully somebody rich buys it for more than 1000 dollars .
 i returned it for $2000 dollars .
 no revenge needed .
 start a gofundme about a homeless brick that was caught on camera giving its only slice of pizza to another person .
 take the money ,  destroy brick so it doesn &apos;t sue you
 break it in half ,  boom ,  two $1000 bricks .
 hit whoever scammed me with the brick .
 this happened to me .
 i bought a laptop from dell ,  and from day 1 it was so riddled with problems ,  it was unusable .
 the simplest tasks took forever .
 wifi ,  ethernet and more crashed continuously ,  requiring a full power cycle to work again .
 formatting & reinstalling windows did nothing .
 worst of all ,  dell support did nothing but delay and delay .
 one day i finally managed to have a dell tech over to check it out .
 he confirmed the countless issues and called up dell to say i require a replacement .
 he hangs up ,  and looks at me .
 and he had to leave me with this quite literal brick .
 late last year i found out that as consumer in the eu (the netherlands specifically) i am well protected against this .
 i consulted with a bureau ,  and they believe that even though so much time has now passed ,  with such an extreme case ,  i am still able to get my $1000 back if i pursue it .
 so that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m doing .
 i &apos;m getting my money back from them ,  one way or another .
 dell can go fuck themselves .
 definition of  &apos;red light &apos; added .
 honestly ,  i thought this would get burried ,  but as a returning dell customer that they royally screwed over ,  i &apos;m happy this is getting the attention it is .
 no company should treat their customers like this .
 give me my money back or this brick is going up your ass .
 op bought that brick from the other thread today didn &apos;t you op ?
 use the same tactic as the last seller used .
 is this gonna become a chain of posts ,  like the one with the speed and the chicken ?
 because if it is ,  i &apos;m happy
 one star review  
 i &apos;d lay it and tell all my friends i &apos;m no longer a virgin .
 yeet the brick at them
 seeing if i can get offered the same deal as the last guy .
 don’t call my brick stupid !
 the guy told me it was a mystery box !
 sell it in a mystery box for $2000
 sell the brick for 2000 dollars to anti-vax mom after slathering it in essential oils and marketing it as “no vax needed rough sponge” patent pending .
 use $1000 to buy 2000 bricks and during the middle of the night ,  brick up every exit in the house ,  cut power and phone line .
 before bricking up last window ,  sneak into house and steal all mobile phones ,  spit in milk container ,  place cookie crumbs all over couches ,  break every stereo device ,  place fake door over front and back bricked doors ,  put shudders in-front of windows (to avoid suspicion) ,  brick up last entrance and leave .
 this is my most liked post ,  thank you for the upvotes
 sell it as a supreme brick
 # bash their fucking head in with it .

 paint the brick gold and cheat soneone else out of $1000
 a brick of cocaine ?
 i would plant it in their car for revenge
 i mean ,  i could say beat him to death with the brick ,  but i &apos;m not a psychopath and it &apos;s not particularly clever .
 so i &apos;m going to go the totally sane route and instead raise another $1000 somewhere in nickels .
 i find the same guy who scammed me for the brick ,  and re-scam him .
 perform the transaction in person ,  wearing a mask so he doesn &apos;t recognize me .
 i demand the money in cash beforehand ,  and we meet up .
 he hands me 10 $100 bills - my hard-earned money .
 i consider it for a moment ,  inspecting each of the bills before nodding once and tucking it neatly into my coat .
 i turn around ,  inputting 6 digits into a wall-mounted safe .
 inside is a brick and a remote .
 i turn around to him ,  offering the brick as i slip the remote into my pocket alongside the cash .
  &apos; realization begins to dawn on his face .
 you &apos;re that guy from before .
  &apos;look ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  man ,  but reddit made me do it .
 i &apos;m sorry ,  but i &apos;m not buying a thousand-dollar brick from you .
  &apos; i turn around ,  tossing the brick back into the safe ,  where it lands with a thunk against the metal .
  &apos;could i at least get my money back ?
  &apos; reaching into my jacket pocket ,  my hand instead comes out with the remote .
 he begins to realize that something is wrong ,  but before he can do anything ,  i press the button and a hidden hatch in the ceiling above him slams open .
 20 , 000 nickels rain down with a monstrous roar ,  instantly crushing him under 100 kg (220 lb) of metal .
 i &apos;m still out a total of $1000 ,  but this time it was worth it .
 sell it to pink floyd because they’re always looking for another brick in the wall .
 return it for a full refund or at least store credit .
   did you buy at bricks r us ?
  if so ask for roy ,  he will get you a refund .
 i educate the brick and send it to work at geico so i can save 15% or more on car insurance 
 beating the shit out of them with the brick
 steal their 1 milion dollars 
 jokes on him ,  i &apos;m one brick richer
 you can drill a hole into the brick and make this happen .
 first comment that properly assigns blame .
 sad it was this far down .
 what’s blue and really bad for your teeth ?
 a really fast brick .
 all the toothpaste in the world suddenly flying away really really fast ?
 what &apos;s red and bad for your teeth ?
 that was so well crafted .
 much better than the obvious “hit them with it” response .
 what &apos;s stopping you now ?
 it would be a bricksey 
 a vertical brick tower
 we &apos;ll call it a rectangular prism scheme™
 we &apos;re the anti-pyramid scheme .
 it’s like a reverse straw .
 i clicked on the article because i thought it was referring to this .
 people will buy anything with “supreme” on it tbh
 now we must ask the glorious karma gods to make this post famous
 put  &apos;supreme &apos; on it and sell it to some rich chinese hypebeast  .
 i was watching live ebay bidding yesterday where people were paying $100 for a bag of chips my company sells for $3 .
 what silly  meat sacks we are !
 hello ,  rich people ?

 yes ,  i &apos;ll hold .
 a  &apos;friend &apos; doesn &apos;t get it .
 help me explain ?
 i’m the husband so i can’t take revenge
 hahaha ,  that was my proposal on the other threadd .
 glad it worked for both of us .
 i am sorry you were not satisfied with your 1000 brick .
 two-thousand dollars dollars .
 i got cocaine and weed with it .
 somebody clue me in
 yeah i would’ve made sure there was a legally binding document as well .
 they’re pretty cheap i’ve heard
 this makes me feel sorry for the brick
 won’t someone then post a craigslist ad to hire a “bounty hunter of brick murderers” ?
 don &apos;t you fucking dare to hurt the brick
 hit the brick with whoever scammed me .
 when little timmy scammed a guy ,    .
 that faking ,  taking boy -   .
 he gave a self-contented sigh ,    .
 and settled down with joy .
  &apos;oh smart and artful mighty me ,    .
 how sharp and sage and shrewd -   .
 i am the skilful sort ,  &apos; said he ,    .
  &apos;a deep ,  discerning dude !
  &apos;there &apos;s few as sly as i ,  &apos; he said ,    .
  &apos;and few with half the mind -   .
 in all the open world ahead ,    .
 and all the world behind !
  &apos;i &apos;m sweet and neat and keen and quick   .
 and wise and slick ,  &apos; he sighed .
 but timmy didn &apos;t see the brick .
 and timmy fucking died .
 i have a brick   .
 they have a skull   .
 unless they give you $1m
 they’ll never see it coming .
 if this wasn &apos;t the top comment i was going to be sorely disappointed .
 former dell tech support agent here .
 for anyone who has recurring issues and you can &apos;t seem to get any help ,  tell the next tech support agent you talk to that when you turned it on ,  it started smoking .
 if you need more ,  mention the smell of hot electronics .
 one thing dell doesn &apos;t want is a lawsuit because their faulty machine burned someone &apos;s house down .
 this used to work on any dell system ,  laptop or desktop and no matter the age ,  they &apos;d replace it ,  typically with a close equivalent refurb so make sure you aren &apos;t going to get shafted by getting something worth less than you paid for .
 another thing ,  technically this is fraud if you do it ,  but if they can &apos;t fix their lemons ,  get them to make you lemonade .
 thank you ,  anonymous stranger !
 this is compacted version of the full list of issues: .
 i bought a dell inspiron 15r special edition and received it on july 26th .
 within 1 month: .
 - wifi connection randomly dies (1-5x per day ,  sometimes even more) .
 - keyboard has manufacturing fault .
 - laptop freezes while trying to shutdown (2x) .
 within 2 months: .
 - laptop became utterly slow for no reason (returns daily) .
 - the  &apos; button does not work well unless i type slowly .
 - the shift key keeps malfunctioning while holding it down (results in things like  &apos;heeeeeeeeeey &apos; when trying to type in caps) .
 - the backspace button almost never works anymore .
 - a small piece of the n key has broken off for no apparent reason .
 - watching 720p or higher quality videos from disk causes horrible stutters in audio and video .
 - websites sometimes load 100x slower than ususally (or more even) .
 - during bootup sometimes my wallpaper changes every milisecond causing very extreme lag .
 - cable internet now also randomly loses connection .
 - videos sometimes appear with obvious artifacts .
 - internet connection randomly freezes (does not appear to disconnect) .
 - audio & video for video files often stutter when performing simple tasks (new tab; opening folder ,  etc) .
 - the c button almost never works anymore .
 - hard disk makes clicking sound (1-2x per day; becomes more frequent) .
 + this is a heavily compacted version of the issue list .
 + issues that are likely related to ones already listed and/or aren &apos;t dell &apos;s fault are not listed .
 + to keep this list readable ,  issues aren &apos;t explained in detail ,  making them seem like less big of a deal .
 other than that ,  it was also just extremely slow .
 i got a similar laptop to replace it later ,  with nearly identical cpu & ram .
 when i forced that laptop to run at 800mhz ,  it was still much faster than the dell .
 fuck dell and their shitty alienware
 what does red light even mean ?
 i &apos;m picturing him just yelling red light at you then running away in the confusion 
 dell sucks ass and i too own a very expensive brick
 i worked with a company that went with dell specifically for the tech support .
 one of the laptops we bought was broken before we got it .
 we notified them ,  they sent us a new one and asked for us to send the broken one back .
 sounds like my 2009 dell .
 first laptop i ever owned and it was for school .
 3 months into the semester it blue screens .
 i was retarded back then ,  and i didn &apos;t back anything up or put things on usb drives .
 lost my term paper and had to start over .
 dell support was useless and basically told me i was sol .
 major fuck dell .
 this is one of the reasons i love amazon and i never make a large purchase that i can &apos;t afford the insurance for .
 i actually just recently had to return a laptop to them because it was running awful and had issues from the day it arrived ,  i waited until the last possible day to return it and they just said  &apos;yeah sure send it in your refund will be processed by the end of the week &apos; .
 i think i would split the money ,  so as not to get arrested
 the correct  answer is to first be sure the seller gets a million for the brick and then smash yourself in the head with said brick .
  call the cops and have them fingerprint the brick .
 i like this ,  cause if he agrees ,  you made 999k ,  and if not you can still hit him with the brick .
 upon review ,  i seem to be a smidge off on my calculations
 where did you get a million from ?
 the question specifies a thousand dollars .
 oh no they are extremely gay and have a brick fetish
 for some $1 , 000 , 000 plus a highway brick up the ass is win win .
 red forman when did you get a reddit
 giving a whole new meaning to the phrase  &apos;shit a brick &apos;
 which way is sideways ?
 that &apos;s my fetish
 then fuck his wife .
 pretty sure the guy cudnt give 2 fucks considering hes a millionaire now 
 that’s how mafia works .
 you’d need someone that’s bankrolling your venture .
 can you post a link to the speed and the chicken ,  preferably the first one ?
 what &apos;d be the next post ?
 the person you sold a brick to for $1000 is unhappy and has tracked you down .
 how do you get rid of them ?
 what is this in reference to ?
 i can &apos;t believe i had to scroll this god damn far for context
 thank you ,  i was looking for the pointer for us out-of-the-loopers .
 i like how this is downvoted .
 like there is a brigade of people who want only them to be able to understand the joke .
 no normies ,  only people who have time to follow the reddit meta 24/7
 if i could give 0 stars i would
 where the fuck can you get bricks for 50c ?
 aka return to sender
 this was the first thing i thought of when i saw the title ,  even though i own an iphone .
 you are just holding it wrong .
 sorry ,  ice cream machine is broken .
 jesus ,  slow down satan .
 i &apos;ve heard she can lay  &apos;em faster than you &apos;d believe !
 there might be someone as dumb as you ,  but nobody twice as dumb as you .
 can &apos;t afford a drill .
 i just spent 1000$ on a brick .
 hopefully the rough edges won’t hurt too bad 
 and make a youtube video out of it and gain back the thousand dollars
 we truly live in a society
 paints brick blue quickly in case they don’t get the joke
 my friend doesn &apos;t understand why the brick would be blue .
 can you explain it to him please ?
 i &apos;d say your teeth are the least of your worries if a brick &apos;s blue shifted enough to be visibly blue .
 i don &apos;t have $1000 to buy a brick
 that polish son of a gun
 i think that &apos;s just a tower
 the best towers do tend to be vertical .
 ahh i can see it now .
 the media coverage of  &apos;the clay-brick scandal &apos;
 why not just the pillar scheme™ ?
 also called an iphone 
 i &apos;m not mad that this exists .
 does supreme just post their name on any item they can find and sell it for a ridiculous price ?
 i own one of these .
 worth the money but i didn’t pay nearly that much .
 well they also literally sold a brick at one point 
 supreme nachos are the best though .
 leave karma gods alone .
 we just need to add a videogame giveaway .
 they literally sold those and they resell for $150 .
 can i get a few bags of chips ?
 why are they so expensive ?
 how many upvotes for a year supply of chips ?
 i wonder if it wasn &apos;t just money laundering or drugs .
 someone sets up a deal ,  the other person pays for legal goods to make it look legit .
 get the money from ebay and paypal won &apos;t bother you .
 let me get some for 4$ pls
 i understood that reference 
 you should chisel the reddit alien on it ,  but that &apos;ll fly like bricks don &apos;t .
 i’m the husband so i can’t take revenge .
 what &apos;s this a reference to ?
 more than impressed with your returns policy .
 10/10 would buy from again
 he’s going to get it from the atm machine using his pin number
 i know ,  i get all these references .
 i like to imagine whenever i see this meta comment style ,  it’s all the same user just prowling threads and alerting the rest of us about how meta something is .
 and that’s how op gets money !
 we could start a gofundme to prevent this and save the brick !
 but then they &apos;ll have to pay for the bounty cause it &apos;s legal to kill bricks that you own
 story about a homeless man giving his last $20 to a lady for gas went viral .
 her and her husband start a gofundme ,  raise all sorts of money ,  give him a tiny bit ,  and keep the rest .
 they buy a house ,  cars ,  go on vacation ,  etc .
 he rats on them ,  turns out they were all in it together ,  the three went to prison or something .
 username checks out .
 isaac newton would like to know your location
  &apos;if i can &apos;t pick up the hammer and hit you with it ,  i &apos;ll hit it with you !
  &apos; -glorious lord thanos to thor ,  god of sparks
 scam the brick with whoever hit me .
 hit the whoever with the brick that scammed me
 isaac newton has entered the chat .
 your timmy poems are the best
 timmy always gets his .
 i &apos;d love to know what poor timmy did to you in a past life to warrant so many poems about him .
 and then i too would hit him with a brick .
 timmy is my favorite personality of sprog .
 fun fact: that video was released in 2016
 take the $1m and hit them anyway ?
 is this some kind of goal we weren &apos;t told about ?
 they won &apos;t give you the whole million ,  but like ,  $2 , 000 for getting them that million would be fucking nice .
 ulpt stuff right there .
 why does my lemonade smell burnt ?
 can confirm this for mac’s as well .
 i had a similar situation with a macbook .
 they didn’t take me seriously when i brought it in and even after several hard drive replacements ,  they wouldn’t replace the computer .
 that is until the computer started running hot and i sustained a burn on my legs when using it .
 left with a brand new ,  upgraded version of the computer with applecare the same day after 2 years of issues and complaints .
 i hate that it takes this amount of theatrics for someone to respond .
 i had to do the same thing with my jeep ,  and i was in the bumper to bumper warranty .
 dealership wouldn’t touch it ,  gave me the run around .
 jeep itself wouldn’t do anything until the dealership did something .
 tomorrow dell &apos;s gonna get so many smoking computers .
 used to work apple tech support and i immediately had to transfer any call where the customer stated anything about a fire to the tier 2 support .
 t2 would generally fix anything i guess .
 anyway ,  one time this lady told me that when she tried to save something it made a fire on her desktop so off she went to t2 .
 about an hour later i got irate feedback from that tech stating  &apos;asian people have an accent ,  and don &apos;t actually mean fire &apos; .
 i work for a smartphone manufacturer .
 fraud related to claims like this are rampant .
 we actually have a process where we require photos of the damage ,  require having the device sent to engineering for analysis ,  and in the mean time you can get a loaner device (usually some 3+ year old budget device that isn &apos;t worth more than $50) and if the device is found to have actually exploded out of nowhere you get a free replacement ,  otherwise you have to go through our standard replacement options for it .
 so basically we &apos;re safe from the rampant fraudsters ,  but in the event of an actual galaxy note 5 situation ,  good luck .
 however i can say our testing process is intensive enough that i &apos;d be very surprised if we did get hit with such a situation .
 woah woah woah ,  slow down .
 take this over to r/illegallifeprotips ,  where it belongs .
 i had a friend that worked for dell .
 he said the problem is dell purchases in bulk literally the worst manufactured parts possible for cheap and then throws computers together with the crappy components .
 you probably got a laptop made with 100% defective parts and they know it .
 also have the same one ,  also from the netherlands .
 i luckily did not have that many problems ,  i did sent it backs once because i had blue screens when lifting the laptop while open from one place to another with one hand .
 they seemed to have fix it .
 but it still happened occasionally (though rarely) .
 i still have and use that laptop ,  but only for watching movies or something .
 it was mainly used for my programming education .
 oh and i once ordered a full hd screen off ebay and replaced it myself ,  it miracously workers though the casing took a hit (shit quality) .
 and about a year ago i replaces the cd drive with a ssd bay .
 man you must download some weird ass porn 
 lmao sorry ,  it means it &apos;s a no-go .
 dell told him it &apos;s not happening ,  and i could tell the guy was truly sorry and embarrassed he &apos;d have to leave me with that brick .
 red light:  &apos;i &apos;m sorry dave .
 i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do that .
 what do you do at a red light 
 from what i hear everywhere ,  dell is good to companies ,  bad to consumers .
 blue screens can be due to more than faulty hardware (read firmware & os) ,  but that sucks .
 you know what &apos;s funny about my case ?
 my family had bought 3 dell pcs in 2004-2005 and they were amazing machines .
 near silent even when gaming and they &apos;ve served us great .
 when we needed some support at the time ,  dell helped us well (or so my parents told me) .
 that &apos;s part of the reason i got the dell .
 we had a good experience with them .
 but they royally screwed over a returning customer ,  who now made sure his friends and relatives stay away from dell .
 my laptop had the nickname  &apos;dell from hell &apos; btw .
 but officer ,  she tried to take my money and go home ,  so i knocked her out with it and told her she’s already home because she’s a brick house .
 but the other person could get a very good lawyer with the million
 double check your numbers there bud
 another post about getting $1000000 for selling a brick for $1000
 well it &apos;s continuing up them until it comes out the other side ,  so no matter how kinky they are it &apos;s gonna hurt at some point .
 i think you need to do some self reflection on why you think there are degrees of gay and those degrees are apparently measured in butthole gape .
 give me my money back and this brick is going up your ass .
 liking bricks in your ass doesn’t make you gay
 just like my fantastic 4 doujins .
 only fair because jerk store .
 instead i &apos;d say fucking his husband would be the ultimate power move .
 what level do i need to be in mafia city to get 1 , 000 , 000 for selling someone a brick ?

 that’s the one part of the plan you’re questioning ?
 worse strategy than invading russia in autumn
 nah youre thinking of pipe
 if you can afford $1000 for a brick ,  you can afford a drill .
 this comment is underrated  
 i don’t understand what he means .
 i just shift my pants
 i see you have just taken astronomy 
  &apos;a careful reading of official major league baseball rule 6 .
 08(b) suggests that in this situation ,  the batter would be considered  &apos;hit by pitch &apos; ,  and would be eligible to advance to first base .
 motherfucker ,  if it’s for my $1000 + his newly acquired $1 , 000 , 000 so fucking be it .
 if that link isn &apos;t relativistic baseball ,  we &apos;re gonna have a fuckin problem .
 this was actually a very intersting ​read
 hey at least the batter gets to advance to 1st base
 at least he got on
 a friend got me his book for christmas one year - best present i’ve ever received !
 the only inaccuracy i saw in that article is at the very end that says according to mlb rule 6 .
 08(b) the batter would technically be hit by the ball and he would advance to first .
 the correct ending would be since the batter did indeed swing and made contact with the ball it’s simply a foul ball and they would have to attempt it again .
 i knew what the link would be before clicking on it .
 one of my favorites .
 i have never understood thermonuclear physics so well in my life .
 i painted the brick blue because i &apos;ve never seen a blue brick ,  and to be honest with you ,  i kinda wanted to see a blue brick .
 when something approaches you rapidly enough ,  the doppler effect has the same effect on light that it does on sound .
 you know how ambulances sound weird when they &apos;re driving to and away from you ?
 it &apos;s like that ,  but with visible light .
 that &apos;s a years old meta .
   good job son .
 “what does a snail even do ?
 not without mortar it isn &apos;t .
 noob tower with bricks
 i think those are more expensive though xd
 i &apos;m less disappointed that it exists and more disappointed that 256 people in the last 12 months have bought it for an average of $133 .
 people come up with dumb shit all the time .
 but people are actually buying into this .
 supreme’s whole thing is collaborating with luxury brands and throwing their logo over it  .
 they tried to do a collab with birkenstock but birkenstock didn’t want the supreme logo on their sandals 
 the prices they sell it at aren &apos;t too ridiculous .
 it &apos;s only the reselling market that makes it those prices .
 supreme will be talked down on reddit normies looking from the outside in on streetwear and hype culture .
 supremes whole idea is exclusivity ,  meaning low stock numbers ,  which contribute to overall market value .
 the designs vary from very simple prints to crazier ,  edgier designs like the upcoming all over embroidered map collection but overall have a vintage spin in terms of patterns and colors .
 i &apos;ve noticed that most (90%) items have little to no supreme branding on them and in collaborations with designers ,  supreme items rarely go noticeably above the designer &apos;s own equivalent item &apos;s retail price .
 basically ,  supreme is by far the most approachable designer brand with common sense prices ,  unique designs/colors ,  and is ethically made .
 they sell it for fairly cheap retail (north face x supreme shirt is around $34) ,  then people who buy them sell them for ridiculous mark ups .
 it’s currently selling for $150 on stockx .
 free copy of fortnite full game !
 or supreme patty
 i thought people were reselling supreme bricks for over 1000$ ?
 i mean 150 is still crazy but thats pretty low when it comes to supreme resale .
 technically you can have all the chips you want if you run fast and have questionable morals !
 silly meat sacks
 maybe people think they’re rare or discontinued ,  but they’re sitting in my warehouse ,  haha .
 12 upvotes and say my parents were wrong about me ,  and i’m prettier than karen in sales .
 i &apos;ve seen that happen a few times .
 i remember seeing some guy on youtube who was trying to sell their wow account putting up a listing for  &apos;1 piece of paper &apos; .
 you &apos;re not allowed to sell your wow account on ebay ,  but there &apos;s no rule that says you can &apos;t sell a piece of paper and nobody said the account can &apos;t have any specific words that may or may not be related to usernames or passwords on them .
 cool cool cool .
 i don &apos;t pls esplan
 in the original thread there was a post along the lines of “i’d sell it to my husband for $1000 and tell him to trust me”
 a response on the original thread said someone would sell the brick to their husband which would likely accept with no questions asked .
 it appears you also reaped a substantial number of fake internet points from our transaction as well ,  good work sir .
 i don &apos;t ,  will someone clue me in ?
 but op is still mad because the person who sold them the brick got $1 , 000 , 000 for even less work than that
 fuck brickses ,  get money ?
 that &apos;s how the mafia works
 it &apos;s only 3/5ths of a murder anyway .
 that’s very twisty

 i quite liked him in sherlock .
 he did a good smaug too .
 as good as it gets really .
 not that it should be abused from ,  but good to know where one can have some leverage if you &apos;ve been shafted by a giant company .
 really unethical life tip .
 it &apos;s possible to remove the laptop battery ,  and overvolt the computers contacts .
 frying the mobo .
 something 2 or 3 times the battery &apos;s dc voltage should do it .
 hard to prove it was deliberate ,  and  not a faulty battery .
  generally safe to do if you &apos;re careful .
 also prorevenge worthy .
 dell is the king of unethical .
 it &apos;s like both unethical and ultimate life pro tip
 when i poured my lemonade it started smoking and tastes like hot electronics .
 because you used combustible lemons ?
 so dell is the real life version of harry wormwood aka matilda’s father .
 this is good to know for me .
 when i changed jobs i was issued a dell laptop and the screen (or something) freezes/died in the first 5 months .
 my company replaced it with an i7 dell and it changed my mind about hating laptops .
 i must’ve gotten the luckiest dell laptop because this thing is a fookin trooper and i have reconsidered my hatred of laptops vs desktops .
 maybe i got the opposite of op’s dell .
 i thought dells were good .
  what is the best manufacturer for a laptop ?
 bought a dell tower ,  was offered insurance for 12$ so i thought why not .
 i spent 12 hours on it and the graphics card died .
 dell says the tower was out of warranty after being on hold for an hour 45m .
 i called my insurance ,  they sent me a check worth the money for the tower since they cant diagnose it with the graphics card dying .
 dell waited 3 weeks before sending a return label and for whatever reason ,  a refurbished tower and i was so over it at this point i kept the broken tower for scrap parts for when this refurbished one goes  
 did he give you any info as to why it was a no go ?
 shes mighty mighty ,  letting it all hang out .
 the key is hitting him with the brick regardless .
 i think he got hit by a brick before he commented

 isn &apos;t it $1000 plus taxes and fees ?
 he means fuck the brick
 is that why sonic is blue ?
 edwin hubble would like to know your location
 i always heard the blueshift was in between 4th and 5th gear .
 unfortunately ,  randall got this rule wrong .
 in order to be a “hit by pitch , ” the ball must not pass through the strike zone and the batter must make an effort to avoid te pitch .
 since clearly (some of) the ball passes through the strike zone and there’s no way the batter could have had time to avoid the pitch .
 for those wanting to look this up in their own ,  the rules have been renumbered: the current reference should be 5 .
 and ,  in so doing ,  would eventually appear blue if it &apos;s going fast enough .
 but to do so ,  it would need to approach relativistic (sizable fraction of speed of light) speeds .
 that much energy in something the size of a brick would basically create a nuclear blast the moment it hits anything ,  air included .
 still my favorite askreddit meta
 without mortar it &apos;s just jenga
 most expensive (mass produced ,  not specially made) iphone is the same price
 i can imagine a construction worker trolling his foreman by buying and using such a brick as construction material .
 2 years later ,  once the finish building the house ,  the brick would remain there ,  waiting to be discovered .
 you &apos;re assuming it &apos;s different people and not the same person trying to build a house .
 someone is making a killing in marketing .
  &apos;yeah i &apos;d like this job at your company please .
  &apos;well what are you qualifications ?
  &apos;my last job i brought the brand so much value we wrote it on a brick and it was purchased by almost 300 people .
 alright well i &apos;ll go speak to my supervisor about a sign on bonus .
 also v likely a high rate of fakes which makes it better in my supreme opinion
 i know this is an unpopular opinion here on reddit but i &apos;ll say it anyway - i fucking love the fact that there &apos;s a brick that sells for over $100 .
 it &apos;s a beautiful example of supply and demand .
 it &apos;s easy to get upset about a $100 brick ,  but what about single stamps that sell for 100k+ to a serious millionaire collector ?
 it &apos;s the same damn thing on a smaller scale .
 tbf that &apos;s not their whole thing .
 they have had more recent collabs with luxury high fashion brands such as louis vuitton .
 they started as a small skate brand and have turned into a globally recognized brand .
 some pieces they put out are of quality and look great ,  but they still put out those weird items like bricks haha .
 those into the hype street wear go after their sought out  &apos;box logo &apos; shirts and hoodies .
 the brick weird i have to agree haha 
 what the heck humanity

 so essentially you’re sears and the chips are a quick release ratchet ?
 you’re prettier than karen in sales ,  but your parents were right
 if u can sell the brick for 1000$ u get 1 mil .
 a husband sells it to the wife for 1k who then sells it back for 2k to make a bit of a profit .
 it was another ask reddit question tofay
 what original thread ?
 guess i missed something again
 but perhaps he would be wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane 
 double meta since one of the responses was that they’d sell the brick for 1000$ with a contract saying they could return it for 2000$
 depends on the color of the brick .
 meanwhile my neighbor is probably definitely eating cheetos and playing wow .
 i think his old room is right next to you .
 i’m on the same planet he lived on !
 oops — i already gave him my location .
 i can &apos;t believe that dell wouldn &apos;t replace it without a second thought .
 op has every right to do whatever is necessary to either recoup costs or a replacement .
 dell sounds like a real piece of shit ,  here .
 the fact that an insider would reveal a systemic loophole is probably a good indicator about how dell feels about its customers .
 burn in hell ,  dell .
 i &apos;m pretty sure you can immediately tell because the batteries contacts would still be perfect .
 and if you tried to fry the battery as well it &apos;s easy to tell which way the fry came from .
 not to say that dell would be competent enough to do something like that
 careful with those moon rocks ,  cave
 you are beautiful person for making this analogy
 some dells have been bulletproof .
 i have two from the core 2 days that still work perfectly (a d430 and an adamo) .
 i know a few folks who swear by the xps13 .
 yeah ,  no dude is false .
 dell ,  hp ,  lenovo are equally comparable in reliability .
 that &apos;s the main reason their used in enterprise solutions .
 honestly though no one brand beats another because everyone has some issues some place .
 best thing to do is look at what you need spec wise ,  find what models have that ,  and find personal reviews about those models .
 for instance current generations of high end laptops ie dell xps ,  lenovo x1 ,  and hp spectre all have issues but in general some of the best laptops money can buy .
 dell seems to have most issues in their line with motherboards  ,  lenovo just seemed to have various problems ,  hp screen is crooked .
 all of them have over heating issues ,  but hp has the least .
 source had a job with nothing to do and needed a laptop .
 took three months to narrow it down .
 i guess it &apos;s just something they don &apos;t do unless it doesn &apos;t turn on at all or something idk
 well ,  they &apos;re just hopeless at that point .
 50 shades is an absolutely garbage portrayal of kink ,  it &apos;s basically hated by everyone in the community .

 i work for a brick company and i’m contemplating getting this for my office .
 i’m not kidding .
 an idiots money is better spent by someone else .
 it &apos;s a collectable ,  people spend far more on comic books they &apos;re never gonna open ,  i &apos;m not the biggest fan of supreme and the resell on their stuff is ridiculous but the people bringing up the brick kind of just ignore the fact that it &apos;s pop art and not a brick meant for building .
 i mean there &apos;s a guy on the front page showing of his 10s of xbox 360s .
 it &apos;s not really that different if you think about it

 we had a dead space under our new cabinets ,  corner between the stove and the sink ,  so no roll-out type drawers were doable .
 i painted a pentagram and left 5 toys at the corners; a wooden tiki ,  a little gargoyle model ,  a rubber spider ,  marvin the martian ,  and i forget the other .

 me and 3 friends chipped in and bought the supreme brick because it was one of our friends birthdays and he reminds us of quite literally ,  a brick .
 a normal brick would not have nearly enough meaning .
 really well said .
 everyone &apos;s got their quirks and fandoms .
 shit ,  i spent $150 on a set of bionicles ,  but wouldn &apos;t spend a fiver on a supreme brick .
 i think it’s stupid as hell because it’s not for me ,  but that doesn’t mean other people can’t enjoy it .
 most people are like “if i don’t like it ,  everyone that does is an idiot” .
 it might be true .

 it’s never on purpose  .
 and it always hurts
 you could have left the space open and accessible from under the sink .
 there is always a need to store cleaning chemicals ,  garbage bags ,  etc .
 my son started doing that .
 at a certain age he kept asking for bionicles but stopped opening them .
 he &apos;s got all these boxes in his closet collecting dust .
 i dropped 3k on a katana im literally never gonna use .

 that is hilarious .
 the snail story is funny but not the title revenge .
 i thought it was funny the snail following a human .
 true ,  i also left out what the decoy snail is .
 a few months after they finished building the italian restaurant in the resort i do maintenance in ,  i found a rough looking ,  but good working milwaukee drill in the ceiling .
 now i’m just waiting for a nice ceiling to leave it in on my own .
 noone in the household wants to crawl down to do that ,  bad backs and arthritis ,  and don &apos;t want the cats to hide in there .
 cheap-ass ikea cabinets are falling apart already anyway .
 there is some serious money that he can make with those if they are rare
 lucky you ,  you now have an opportunity to give him a wonderful xmas gift: a beautiful piece of furniture for displaying his collection .
 does he have the original toa or the toa nuva ?
 they &apos;re in those cylindrical canisters .
 my little brother &apos;s been asking for a set ,  and i &apos;d be happy to buy them off you !
 but isn &apos;t that fortnite &apos;s key demographic ?
 gravity is very elusive and not easily understandable thinking about just falling shit .
 isaac newton : hold my beer .
 all of these are why i love reddit .
 he &apos;s shadow holding a gun
 and the idea for this is even older than that i &apos;m pretty sure .

 to be honest ,  i just need an audio file of them chewing .

 i feel uncomfortable if it’s in a state of really uncleanliness due to you using it to be clean .
 also if their towels are constantly damp .

 my last ex had a 2018 chevy ,  and killed the engine because she went 60k miles without an oil change .
 i met someone the other day who just brought out a dating app that required a photo to be taken everyday at a random time .
 you only had 15 seconds to take a photo of yourself so you couldn &apos;t fake what you look like .
 he told me sometimes he had to take a picture in a busy metro .
 pretty interesting concept .
 if you missed the photo opportunity you couldn &apos;t use the app for the rest of the day .
 side note: anyone remember that old mtv show room raiders ,  where the girl/guy would go through like 3 people &apos;s rooms and try to determine who to date based upon their room ?
 this could totally work !
 i said it once twice three times in this thread and i &apos;ll say it again .
 who fucking cares that it was clearly staged/faked ?
 i don &apos;t know any of the girls and i don &apos;t know any of the guys .
 i have no involvement in any of their lives ,  it doesn &apos;t matter to me if they &apos;re real - it was entertaining .
 i didn &apos;t watch room raiders as a junior in high school because i thought love was in the air and that somebody would find their forever by sniffing panties .
 i watched it because it was hilarious .
 edit 2: some of you are really mad about my first edit .
 guys ,  this is  &apos;askreddit &apos; .
 i &apos;m sitting in my pajamas talking about a tv show from 16 years ago .
 take a deep breath .
 i &apos;m not that serious about the show - i honestly hadn &apos;t thought of it in over a decade until seeing this thread this morning .
 i’d say kitchen and bathroom if i’m allowed to pick two .
 how those two rooms of a home are taken care of can tell you a lot about a person .
 are you making this app ,  op ?
 i didn’t realize i’d start a discussion so i’ll add to my answer .
  “bookshelf” can mean anything from actual bookshelf to ereader to even just a list of books they’ve read .
  i love to read and can’t imagine being with someone who has no interest in learning .
 it’s not so much what someone reads so long as they show an interest in learning ,  expanding their minds ,  and enjoying a good story .
  seeing their bookshelf can tell you a lot about what interests they have and the interests you share .
 you don’t have to like the same books at all - in fact i love the idea of sharing my favorite books with someone who’s never read them (but will hopefully enjoy them) and vice verse .
 playlist for sure that &apos;d tell a lot
 spice cabinet ,  bookshelf ,  browser bookmarks
 bookcase and their spotify playlists .
 i would want to see their garbage can .
 you can tell a lot about how messy ,  resourceful ,  healthy etc they are from their trash

 their most valuable item .
 id want to know if they select status symbols ,  material objects ,  something sentimental or their favourite game ,  book or collectable .
  almost like if there was a fire and you could only grab 3 things what would you take .
 obviously a photo of their junk drawer .
 you know ,  the one full of cables ,  batteries ,  spare christmas cards from 5 years ago ,  small change ,  and those kinds of things .
 video game collection
 someone ,  somewhere is data mining  &apos;private &apos; internet profiles to meet people online .
 gold diggers would thrive
 not answering the question but that is one of the most brilliant ideas for a dating app i &apos;ve ever heard .
 i &apos;d say probably their bedroom as you can tell a lot about someone through this - i mean it &apos;s their own space where they can relax and decorate it however they &apos;d like .
 you could see how many pillows and blankets they have ,  their personal choice of decorum ,  whether they like to read ,  what their style is like from their wardrobe ,  how they &apos;d decorate the walls whether that would be paint or wallpaper ,  whether they had posters or certificates or awards or pinboards or calendars or pictures or paintings ,  etc .
 i don &apos;t know what it is about it ,  i just feel like you can learn a lot about someone via their bedroom and for me personally ,  i know that it &apos;s something i analyse when going to a friend/family members house if invited to their room .
 or more of the inside .
 if its clean and stays clean i &apos;ll date you .
 i &apos;ve always grown up with my parents keeping the inside of our cars neat and tidy and make sure there is no garbage in it ,  but if one of my friends or thier parents drove me somewhere and their car had trash and crumbs everywhere ,  it just makes me uncomfortable .
 a full access to their browsing history
 sounds like the hgtv version of catfished .
 their favourite place to relax .
 could be a balcony or a garden ,  a nice couch in the living room ,  in front of their computer ,  etc .
 young hot burglars are in your area
 i &apos;d like to date a guy with good sneakers ,  but they &apos;re dirty .
 he &apos;s stable enough that he can afford a nice pair of sneakers but doesnt sweat it if they get dirty after some wear .
 fingernails- if i see the sloth tips i’m out
 if your toilet is nasty ,  your nasty .
  if a grown man cant clean his toilet ,  he &apos;s looking for a mom ,  not a partner
 this is a brilliant idea .
  someone should start a service like this .
  you don &apos;t ever get a picture of the person however .
  when you meet them the first time ,  you &apos;re getting to see them for the first time .
 ok op ,  first i gotta say good job on an original question .
 i think the best picture that you could see to get to know someone would be a picture of their bathroom .
 first: over or under on the tp ,  second: cleanliness .
 if your levels of cleanliness don’t match in the bathroom ,  they probably won’t match everywhere else .
 picture of what makes the person happy
 my fiancée had the most untidy bedroom that i had ever seen when we first met .
  but i love her and she is the best thing that ever happened me .
 first person to respond to the comment this was linked from saying “i’m here to claim my silver .
 ” will receive a silver .
 i &apos;d be looking for a home and not a show house .
 a home indicates a person who doesn &apos;t care what others think of them  .
 a show house indicate someone who keeps up with the joneses and cares more about what others think of them than being true to themselves .
 time to unsub from r/dragonsfuckingcars
 in my country we have a show ,  basically called  &apos;farmer seeks wife &apos; and it &apos;s just farmers dating
 this alone would weed out the psychopaths .
 what is you hand wash dishes ?
 plates and utensils on the bottom ,  everything else up top .
 hand wash pots and pans .
 my therapist told me that one of her patients was depressed so he didn’t clean his room for months .
 anyway ,  she asked him to see a picture of his room and that made him clean it up because he was too ashamed .
 i hope you like piles of laundry thrown everywhere
 if this was the case i would have never given my wife a chance .
 i love her like no other ,  but she is such a loud chewer .
 do they chew with their mouth open ?
 also ,  do they slurp shudder
 i &apos;m sorry we &apos;ll never be together .
 shout out to r/misophonia !
 i’ve always told my friends that when having company over ,  especially if it’s a date ,  that the first and foremost thing they’ll be judged on is the state of the bathroom(s) ,  whichever they use .
 this is always the first thing i clean if i find out someone is coming over last-minute and don’t have enough time to tidy everything .
 next is the kitchen .
 it’s fine to have a couple dishes in the sink ,  but all surfaces should be clean/wiped down .
 after that ,  i’ll feel pretty at ease with someone at my place .
 i look for hand soap next to the sink .
 if they don’t have it ,  they don’t wash their hands .
 had to scroll far too long to find this .
 i was over at a friend’s house during law school .
 maybe fancied her a little ,  but was mostly just helping her move .
 got to the bathroom and i was absolutely fucking horrified .
 turned off any romantic feelings i had for her immediately .
 (which ,  it turns out ,  was a good thing .
 i just wanna see if the tp roll has a beard or a mullet .
 that’s all i need to know about a person .
 this is a good shout .
 i hate it when you visit someone and they just have one damp towel hanging on the wall .
 like is that for my hands or do you use that to dry your bits ?
 some people’s bathrooms are so nasty it’s probably more sanitary to go pee outside .
 i don’t know how people can keep their bathroom so gross when it’s supposed to be where you go to get yourself clean .
 the state of the bathroom tells so much !
 i &apos;m surprised why is this not the highest rated comment ?
 when i first started dating my husband ,  he was in grad school and lived in a shared house with 3 other dudes .
 the bathroom was so so gross .
 i literally cleaned it for them because i couldn’t bring myself to shower in that nastiness .
 i was living with my newly-widowed sister who was cripplingly depressed .
 we had separate bathrooms ,  but hers was suuuuper gross .
 i also cleaned that for her from time to time .
 neither of us is nearly as gross now as our living situations at the time would suggest .
 as it turns out ,  he’s actually a way tidier person than me when it comes to most things ( i’ve got some classic adhd clutter problems) !
 but i’m not sure he could wipe the toothpaste or trimmings from his beard hair out off the sink if he got paid for it .
 our lives have been elevated by the addition of a cleaning lady .
 because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me ,  okay friend  ?
 for me ,  their kitchen cupboard .
 what food do they like ,  and presumably cook ?
 are they on a special diet ?
 what brands do they prefer ?
 do they have decent coffee ?
 do they stock up on stuff like long life milk and basics like baked beans and tinned tomatoes ?
 you can only see the fridge or the freezer .
  my wife is the biggest slob .
  like ,  she seriously doesn &apos;t know how to put anything back where it goes or put new things in a place .
 it &apos;s just piles of stuff on every horizontal surface .
 right now ,  since we got home from work on friday ,  here are the contents of our coffee table: a heated rice bag ,  a bottle of honey ,  a tape measure ,  the valentine &apos;s card i gave her ,  a chair slip cover still in the package ,  pet nail clippers ,  two separate stacks of mcdonald &apos;s napkins ,  a guitar tuner ,  and a sherwin williams paint swatch .
  that table was clear on friday morning .
 we had already developed something special before i got to ,  you know ,  see her place .
 bro ,  i resonate with this so fucking hard .
 we &apos;re engaged and living together ,  but god damn ,  i hired a cleaning service that comes in twice a week to mop and pack shit away basically .
 the house stays clean for maybe 26 hours then it &apos;s back to square one .
 it drives me insane .
 shit is just left all over the place and never packed away ,  and when i bring it up i get the:  &apos;i &apos;m gonna pack it away &apos; or  &apos;well you do this ,  this and this ,  so me leaving something out isn &apos;t that bad &apos; .
 the cat thing doesn &apos;t sound that bad to me :)
 how did you know all the things i collect ?
 oh man ,  collections can be a huge red flag .
 one time i dated this dude that had a massive lightsaber collection .
 he was obsessed with them .
 he finally confessed to me that they were trophies from murdering jedi ,  and only then did i notice that he was a ten foot tall robot-person with a lung problem .
 i would prefer not to let a potential date know how much i &apos;ve spent on steam .
 i collect coasters .
 those round paper thingies you put your drink on .
 what does it say to you ?
 hmm is it weird to collect nothing ?
 i wouldn &apos;t have documentation going that far back .
 noodles with tomato sauce and sausage .
 noodles with tomato sauce and sausage .
 noodles with tomato sauce and sausage .
 noodles with potato sauce and sausage .
 i don &apos;t remember .
 never expected a stupid list with a funny typo would be my most upvoted comment .
 six meals or six different meals ?
 i have this amazing personal artisan sandwich chef named james john .
 his father also makes pizzas for a decent price .
 1x ramen and 5x fried eggs
 freshly microwave meal .
 freshly microwave meal .
 freshly microwave meal .
 freshly microwave meal .
 freshly microwave meal .
 freshly microwave meal .
 now ,  tell me about myself .
 edit the responses to my comment show you really can &apos;t tell everything about someone by asking about their food .
 everyone is off .
 try not to read too much into things y &apos;all .
 idk why but this is hilarious to me .
 shouldn’t be but it is .
  &apos;hey ,  i wanna go on a date .
 lemme see the carfax &apos;
  &apos;drove my chevy to the levy ,  oops my dipstick is dry &apos;
 how often should i change my oil ?
 can i do it myself easy enough ?
 i’m more interested on how you get 60k miles on a 2018 ,  i just traded my 18 i bought brand new with 34 miles and it only had 14750 a year and a half later .
 sounds like prime data mining
 could you set the window so it occurred while you were awake ?
 though middle of the night selfies would be pretty telling .
 who &apos;s that next to you .
 that &apos;s interesting if not a little creepy .
 if you &apos;re paying enough attention you could figure out someone &apos;s routine
 oh ,  that &apos;s a neat concept .
 i assume you have to already be in the app for it to happen otherwise you &apos;d have requests for photos whilst driving and in meetings and such .
 that’s some black mirror kinda stuff .
 my issue is that there are some weirdos out there that would be able to detect where you are and all that based on background clues .
 kinda cool but also creepy in a way
 does this actually exist ?
 i think the idea could be improved if instead of having to do it everyday forever it would only be a for a week to signup ,  and your profile wouldn &apos;t go live till the end of the week .
 the photos would still be at random times of the day and all that .
 often it &apos;s not even enough to get my phone .
 do i have to hold my phone in my hands 24/7 ?
 i was like 11 when i watched that show and didn’t realize you had to sign up to raid/be raided .
 so i would go to bed every night with brushed hair and a very clean room ,  just in case .
 they have a baseball bat in here so now i know they’re sporty !
 is this one one where they would go over the bed with a black light to highlight any umm fluids left recently ?
 because i remember an episode where a dude was using a black light on a girls bed and it was covered in white glowing marks .
 she get all embarrassed and said it was her dog that slobbers every where .
 and the dude was like sure if was .
 my friend was on it and i can tell it was 100% fake .
 he had different name in the show ,  it was not his room ,  he even lives in different city .
 he got the part at a casting for a random acting job ,  there was nothing real in it .
 that show had the wildest decision making i &apos;ve ever seen .
  &apos;well guy #1 had 12 terabytes of violent porn and a picture of his fiancee on his nightstand ,  but guy #2 had a jar of mayonnaise that &apos;s almost expired in his fridge .
 i &apos;m choosing guy #1 .
 cannot believe i had to scroll down this far to find bathroom .
 a nasty bathroom is a huge red flag .
 bukowski said something along the lines of “you can tell the health of someone’s spirit by the perpetual state of their kitchen .
 weed out the monsters with 1000 file folders and word documents .
  satans desktop is 400x600 with large desktop icons of all the people in hell .
 my husband &apos;s desktop gives me severe anxiety .
 we &apos;re both very tidy people and have to keep things clean and neat otherwise we get antsy and anxious .
 but his dektop has every single file on it .
 the entire screen is just covered with stuff .
 it bugs the absolute hell out of me .
 op is doing a consumer survey and we never even knew
 is there a particular book or books that would make them an immediate  &apos;yes &apos; ?
 link to goodreads shelves like tinder/bumble does for spotify
 get screwed over if you use a public library .
 my personal favorite dating horror story was when i was starting to see a guy with a great bookshelf ,  lots of interests in common ,  only to find out they were his girlfriends haaaaa
 on tinder most people share their spotify top tracks ,  integrated in the app
 there is already a app like that .
 that you can choose the person by their playlist .
 it’s called “tastebuds”
 i always thought with my music taste i &apos;d have some common ground with nearly everyone ,  as my playlist contains everything from heavy metal to pop ,  reggaeton ,  rap ,  classical music ,  dubstep .
 well ,  you name it .
 in reality everyone has something to complain about at least one or multiple genres that i listen to ,  and i swear nearly every single person tells me i have bad taste in music ,  even if i listen to exactly the same bands as them ,  just because i also listen to thing on the other side of the spectrum
 spice cabinet is a good one !
 i can always tell of someone can cook based on what they got in there .
 history major here- you can tell a ton about ancient societies and how people lived by finding their trash piles !
 (midden) it’s really cool .
 this is the only one that matters
 i got water fountain filters for my cats ,  cat treats ,  catnip and sharpies .
 what does that say about me ?
 obviously a photo of their junk .
 if she doesn &apos;t have tetris ,  she won &apos;t ever get my straight four piece
 oh boy ,  finally can bust out my donkey kong barrel blast collection !
 but they would have a lot of competition with other gold diggers because the info they want is so readily available .
 a true battle of the century !
 no different than now .
  anyone with money and on a dating site is likely to want to show it off ,  particularly guys .
 well ,  we have prople trying to fake pictures if themselves already .
  i gaurentee whatever pictures they are taking will be cleaner and more organized than real life .
 do you have a tattoo on your forehead that says  &apos;do not develop my app &apos; ?
 how would one enforce this on the app though ?
 most people will simply put photos of their faces instead of photos of the belongings or house characteristics ?
 only really holds until folk live on their own or in a couple this though .
 like my bedroom is basic as fuck ,  cos i &apos;m only in there to sleep ,  so it is really low priority to make nice .
 it will happen eventually but right now all the personalisation happens in the living room or kitchen where i spend my time
 my parents were the same way !
 to this day ,  i clean out any trash that may have accumulated in the car each night when i go home .
 i can’t leave it messy .
 that &apos;d be unfair ,  id bore people away immediately .
  &apos;how long do you cook a 2 and a half pound pork tenderloin &apos; .
  &apos;best cat flea treatments &apos; .
  &apos;how do i stop my stupid cat from eating too fast &apos; .
 im gonna corner the market on girls looking for shitty cooks with a flea ridden cat that throws its food up .
 me ,  a writer: “yikes”
 i hope they like shop manuals and weird porn
 #  &apos;i &apos;m sorry dave ,  i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do that &apos;
 the beach; i dislike going in the water but i do love sitting on the shore and meditate .
 i love it more at night because i get to look at the infinite darkness of space beyond the horizon .
 the second floor balcony at my office building .
 the office is open 24/7 so i work nights .
 i love taking my breaks on the balcony at night and watch the cars go by ,  watch the mall next to me empty out and close ,  watch the planes and helicopters land and take off at the nearby airport .
 awesome place to relax and think about things .
 what if their  &apos;garden &apos; is just olive garden ?
 but everyone always told me i’d end up married to someone just like mom .
 hey ,  looking for some advice here .
  no matter what i clean with ,  or how often ,  i always have that annoying ring of calcification where the waterline is .
  how do i ultimately get rid of this without buying a whole new damn toilet .
 and they have a series of questions they have to fill out first before their profile goes live that will tell you about their personality .
 dating apps mine so much data from you that you actually do have an attractiveness score .
 they not only analyze your photos but look at how people react to the things you say and little nuances in speech to determine how hot you are .
 that score is used to determine how attractive other people are too .
 this is all from a book called dataclysm that i highly recommend .
 one interesting thing they found is that attractive people are dated on a bell curve .
 ugly people are avoided but super attractive people are too .
 you &apos;re just as unlikely to get a date as a supermodel as a hideous person .
 well shit ,  that’s a real sub !
 well ,  why did i click that ?
 i read the title ,  i knew what was going to happen and i still clicked it .
 we have farmer wants a wife in australia .
 wait ,  you don’t play tetris with your dishwasher ?
 yes but small plates / bowls fit well in the middle row on the top (that is actually too bit for most glasses/coffee mugs .
 i &apos;ve been there numerous times .
 the only time i would shower was when i had appointments at the hospital .
 same with cleaning up the apartment .
 i &apos;d be comatose 99% of the time until i had someone coming to visit .
 then i was on autopilot cleaning like my life depended on it .
 which is a good reason for me to ask people to come over .
 so i have a reason to tidy up :d
 that &apos;s why r/neckbeardnests is not funny or pathetic to me ,  just so sad .
 especially the youngsters who still live at home and whose parents are obviously not okay either .
 i’ll be honest ,  this is 100% me .
 i moved in to my room in july and i still have boxes laying around .
 i have garbage from packaging of furniture and dry goods (no food trash) .
 my chest of drawers is empty because i haven’t organized anything to put into it .
 when i try to clean i don’t know where to start or where to put about half the stuff on my floor .
 so i get overwhelmed and end up curled up in bed watching netflix for the rest of the day .
 i &apos;ve seen so many unmade beds in the background of photos on tinder .
 and pictures taking in public bathrooms with dirty urinals in the background .
 a good floordrobe
 i have that thing where i cant stand chewing sounds .
 they stress me the fuck out .
 people who havent learnt to chew with their mouth closed seem to be the most oblivious to the fact that they chew loud .
 my brother does this .
 he also smacks his lips a little .
 i don &apos;t understand how learned how to chew relatively silently with my mouth closed ,  yet he didn &apos;t .
 we grew up in the exact same environment .
 dated a guy with roommates ,  2 of which shared a very dirty bathroom with him .
 hair and dirt all over the counter ,  toilet ,  tub .
 i chalked it up to having to share with roomates because his bedroom was okay .
 one day i cleaned the bathroom so we might have a romantic bath later .
 we were chilling with the roomates and i  had to pee so i went to the now clean bathroom ,  but there was very little toilet paper and no spare rolls in sight !
 went back to the den area and asked where i might find some ,  he just sort of shrugged and was like  &apos;i don &apos;t know .
  &apos; his roomates just stared at him .
 one if the roomates found a roll somewhere so i could pee and not have to wipe with the cardboard roll ,  and i left a short time later .
 we dated for a few months ,  and i think this was a pretty solid indication of his lazy ,  inconsiderate interior under a charming ,  romantic exterior .
 when i first visited my now-husband ,  his bathroom was not only pretty (which i didn’t expect) but also impeccably clean (it smelled like a just-cleaned bathroom) ,  on top of that ,  he had air freshener and fancy hand soap and nice soft hand towels that smelled fresh .
 i did not expect that considering he was a man living alone ,  and i loved it .
 he also kept his place clean and clutter-free (which coming from a family of messy almost-hoarders ,  where only one or two people clean was nice to see) .
 it made a great first impression ,  i love that he cares about cleanliness (he puts a lot of effort into his grooming even though i’ve never asked him to) ,  he’s gotten a little messy over the years and i’ve gotten a bit more organized but nothing unmanageable; we tidy every other day and just work on leaving things where they belong .
 true ,  a huge factor in breaking up with  y last partner was the state of their bathroom .
 showering was nottt a pleasant experience .
 (@ girls bathrooms in frat houses)
 this is why i &apos;ve developed the 5 minute tidy .
 things that can go garbage/recycling first .
 takes \60 sec to do the whole house if you just look for those things .
 next up - refresh towels .
 toss old ones ,  put up new ones .
 takes less than a minute .
 next is anything that fits in the dishwasher .
 then i do anything else that needs to be done (put shoes away ,  etc) .
 it doesn &apos;t clean the house per se ,  but it does make it look clean .
 for a minute i forgot to grab new hand soap from the store ,  but i had a pump body wash in the bath and i &apos;d just use that .
 someone came over and used the bathroom at that time .
 she didn &apos;t mention the lack of accessible soap but i realized it after she left .
 i do wonder if she judges me for that .
 i went over to a guys house after a first date ,  used his bathroom ,  and immediately left .
 i have literally never seen a bathroom in someone &apos;s house so gross in my life .
  the whole house was disgusting ,  but the bathroom .
 i almost threw up .
 also the fact that he was comfortable bringing a girl back to his house looking like that .
 he texted me later about why i left and i told him and he argued with me about how it &apos;s a ok ,  because he &apos;s a guy .
 like it &apos;s normal for men to live in absolute filth .
 i told him no one ,  regardless of gender should be living that way .
 and then i never texted him again ,  because he truly believed it was ok to live in squalor and filth because he is a man .
 mine typically has a beard .
 my cousin came over one day and used the bathroom .
 i noticed afterwards she had the audacity to flip the existing roll over so it had a mullet .
 especially since it a place where you get clean ,  ready yourself for the day ,  and other hygienic things .
 are you searching for a purpose ?
 then write something yeah it might be worthless .
 honestly one of their best songs ever .
 pointless curses ,  nonsense verses .
 i was searching for this comment
 my kitchen cupboards are essentially a wide variety of spices and oils and vinegars .
 my fridge is mostly water and beer and condiments .
 i mealprep every week and don &apos;t keep snacks around because i &apos;ll snack all day .
 really i &apos;d like to see their coffee collection ,  recipe list ,  and kitchen appliances ,  to make sure we like the same coffees ,  like to try and collect new recipes ,  and like to use a wide variety of appliances to try new foods
 i have no idea why i blanked on that .
 thanks for the detailed explanations guys .
  and ,  uh ,  i &apos;ll be stickin &apos; to my oat milk .
 well ,  no one hides dismembered humans in a fridge ,  do they ?
 the fridge is full of stuff you use regularly ,  the freezer could ba full of stuff you bought weeks ago in case you couldn &apos;t be bothered cooking at some point .
 you could be extremely health conscious and only cook fresh food and still have a freezer full of crap .
 another outlandishly specific sub i never knew i needed in my life .
 lmao my girl used to be horrified of me surprising her at her place when we first started dating .
 now that we &apos;ve lived together for almost 4 years ,  i know she is a messy little shit ,  leaving garbage out on the counter ,  in the sink ,  food/drink left in the rooms attracting bugs .
 i put my foot down on the bug situation and so did she when she saw what she was doing .
 so ,  as a comp ,  we get together every couple or few days ,  put on some coffee and music and clean the house .
 it &apos;s easier to do it together ,  even if it is mostly her mess we are cleaning up .
 same aspect with her laundry .
 she has literally 5 big hamper fulls of clothes on the couch that &apos;s been sitting there for weeks and i separate my stuff because it takes up 2 hampers and she wonders why she still gets mad when i don &apos;t separate her shirts from pants from etcetcetc .
 she still don &apos;t understand when i said the first time ,   &apos;i ain &apos;t ya fuckin maid .
 just because this was me ,  you or your wife might be interested in learning about hoarding tendencies and add .
  i was just a clutter bug for years ,  then depression knocked me into hoarding ,  and now i have a really nice and clean house .
  my brain processes items differently .
  i had to understand that and try dozens of systems to figure out how i can operate with my stuff .
 i am so much happier now .
 for some people ,  tidying up after oneself is just impossible ,  and i have never understood that
 my wife will walk right past the hall closet on her way to set her jacket down on top of the dining room table .
 it is when you don &apos;t have a cat .
 yeah ,  but he missed human body parts
 this will make a fine addition to my collection .
 when i was in high school ,  my friend and i went over to her boyfriends house for the first time .
 turns out he gets sunburns really easily ,  and saves all the peeled skin in little jars .
 he had a shelf near the top of the wall in his bedroom with like 6 jars full of dead skin flakes .
 i never went back .
 they had us in the first half ,  not gonna lie
 see i think you are wrong here .
  unless you are willing to give up gaming .
 then don &apos;t try to snow potential mates .
 be right up front about it .
  anyone that freaks out or makes disparaging comments .
 is a hard pass .
  i don &apos;t care how good they are in bed .
 i can &apos;t even tell you how many gaming buddies my husband has lost because they got a girlfriend/wife .
  if gaming is important to you .
 which your steam library would lead me to believe .
 then stick with someone who &apos;s open to gaming even if you don &apos;t play the same types of games .
  (or that at least has some other sort of solo hobby like reading .
 does she have a 2500 ebook library ?
 hubby and i been together for over 20 years now .
  his steam library is extensive .
  mine probably only has a dozen things in it .
  but i have over 1900 hours in one game that i just started playing last may .
 we don &apos;t game together anymore .
 because i &apos;m bad and he &apos;s an asshole .
   but we spend alot of time sitting next to each other on our own systems .
  it works for us  ;-)
 what if they spent even more than you ?
 “wait so how many games do you own ?
 wow that’s a lot of games .
 which is your favorite ?
 oh ,  so you haven’t played all of them ?
 oh you haven’t played most of them ?
 so why do you keep buying them ?
 i used to go out with a girl who wasn &apos;t really a gamer but she was open to the idea of some co-op gaming ,  so we became steam friends .
 when she texted me  &apos;you have 198 games !
 who has 198 games ?
  &apos; i felt extremely uncomfortable ,  like she &apos;d just found out about the old lady i had to throw down my well ,  even though i knew that number was inflated by dlcs and free stuff .
 you go out a drinking a lot .
 when you do you probably don &apos;t dance .
 you &apos;re the type of person that like to sit and have a conversation with friends .
 you &apos;re probably open to new experiences or at least trying new bars .
 pulling this out of my ass at midnight instead of sleeping .
 that you &apos;re not ready to invest in a more substantial coaster .
 artists are definitely pack rats .
 when you start expanding mediums suddenly everything is potentially useful .
 i don &apos;t collect but people try to make it happen .
 you love star trek ?
 let me buy you merch .
 you &apos;re a dancer ?
 how about this whatever that says 5678 .
 i don &apos;t have any collections
 what &apos;s the longest documentation you have to impress u/thesnappychicken  ?
 hell ,  i barely have documentation on my code ,  these people expect me to document my food too‽
 rice ,  broccoli and chicken .
 rice ,  broccoli and chicken .
 rice ,  broccoli and chicken .
 rice ,  broccoli and chicken .
 rice ,  broccoli and chicken
 i think the last 6 meals is more revealing than the last 6 different meals .
 making the same meal 6 times on the trot says quite a bit about how they feel about food and/or cooking .
 a friend &apos;s sister back in 1998 had the engine seize up .
 after the mechanic asked some questions it turned out there hadn &apos;t been an oil change in five years .
  &apos;you have to change the oil ?
 especially when you consider a lot of dealerships include free oil changes for the first year or two at least
 check your car manual to see the recommended oil change interval and use only the oil that the manufacturer recommends to expect the engine to last as long as possible .
 oil changes are easy .
 all you need is a drain pan that is big enough to hold the oil from the engine ,  a wrench or socket wrench to get the drain plug out of the oil pan ,  and an oil filter .
 i buy fram filters and oil from wal-mart .
 they have rhino ramps that are made of plastic ,  but are very strong and i use them myself .
 using ramps is the probably the safest way to keep a car in the air and be under it .
 check out youtube if you are still unsure .
 every 3-5000 miles is optimal ,  and to do it ,  all you need is the oil ,  a oil filter ,  and a socket wrench to get the drain plug out .
 a car jack too if you &apos;re not a tiny human .
 the oil and filter will maybe run you 20-40 bucks depending on engine size .

 probably was a fleet vehicle (used as a rental car when brand new) i’ve had my car for a year now and put just over 30 , 000 miles on it .

 yep ,  like a combo of location metadata for consumer trends and practice for facial recognition technology .

 totally not that .
 people who down voted you never read a eula .
 oh that &apos;s my mom .
 i had a bad dream .
 who &apos;s that next to you .
  what are you doing on this app ?
 i &apos;d imagine it would only happen randomly while you &apos;re using it ?
 like instead of the next person it &apos;s picture time .
 this could avoid issues like meetings ,  but i guess you couldn &apos;t use it in the bathroom without some weird pictures
 “huh ,  drinking again ?

 and in conclusion ,  next month is lookin- &apos; .
  &apos;sorry ,  i need to step out for a second &apos;
 then you would know when it was happening .
 you are at planet fitness eating a free bagel .
 i know exactly where this is .
 no ,  this guy is fishing his idea for the dating app using the reddit question as a free consumer panel .
 our comments will be individually featured as positives and negatives for adding this feature to the app .
 you didn’t ask ,  but my idea is to add one video with prompted questions .
 some people simply don’t photograph well and are much more charming (and stupid) when speaking .
 that has me thinking that room raiders was really a ploy to get kids to clean their room more .
 that &apos;s fucking adorable
 you never know when the first pre-teen episode is gunna air !
 that &apos;s some quality kid logic there !
 i literally thought the same thing .
 i cleaned a lot just in case and i was an adult i still have that same level of cleaning and presentation in my rooms .
 i know it’s stupid now but a little voice sometimes goes ,  “but if you did get kidnapped and people had to view your apartment they wouldn’t find anything wrong with it .

 my condolences to his family .
 i never expected this podcast to be referenced here .
 good episode of it
 one of my high school classmates was on next .
 he was nexted as soon as he got off the bus lmao .
 imagine coming back to high school and having to live through that .
 i &apos;m not sure where this myth came from that semen glows under blacklight .
 crime scene investigators don &apos;t even use blacklights ,  and semen stains are extremely obvious just under natural light ,  there &apos;s nothing else they are likely to be confused with
 i had a friend on it .
 they did use his real name ,  at least first name ,  and did use his real room .
 i do believe you though .
 i &apos;m sure they just resort to whatever to get it done .
 i mean it was entertaining and really that &apos;s all that matters .
 like ,  even if it were 100% real i had no expectation that a guy picking out a hot girl based upon how messy her room was would end in anything other than disappointed for the two of them .
 kind of reads like it !
 i’m surprised this reference didn’t pop up sooner .
 not any that jump out specifically .
  if they shared the same favorite authors as me or were interested in the same subjects it would mean we had things in common and could talk about those things .
  certain books might be an immediate no though (books that show we have very different views about certain things ,  for example)
 52 copies of mein kampf ?
 the hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy
 this is a good solution to folks on here saying they on read on their kindle/audiobooks/from the library/etc .
 put up a pic of your library card and your current loans .
 my girlfriend (who i met on tinder) told me this was what turned me from a maybe to a yes .
 yeah ,  but the tracks that come up for me are not representative of my real music taste .
 i &apos;d rather be able to put together a custom playlist to share with people .
 i met my bf through tastebuds !
 i wouldn &apos;t say it &apos;s very active ,  tho .
 and he says he never expected to meet anyone from that dead website ,  but here we are 3 years later .
 if it &apos;s not over the top ,  you know they &apos;re a sociopath .
 bitches love my square piece
 back in my early 20s i had a buddy ,  lets call him bob ,  with a damn nice car .
 he poured out his life &apos;s savings (all 3 years of it) to buy the thing but fuck it he was a young delivery driver it &apos;s not that insane .
 well it &apos;s definitely a little bit crazy but it &apos;s not full on coocoo for coacoa puffs .
 anyway ,  bob was actually quite a hit with the ladies despite being a normal looking guy of humble means .
 not that he didn &apos;t have an enjoyable personality but the women he was hooking up with were always drop dead gorgeous .
 not to come off like an incel but the math just wasn &apos;t adding up and ,  being more than a little envious ,  i asked what the hell was his secret ?
 turns out bob had been going to the atm at the bank and digging through trash cans looking for anything with a big number on it .
 he &apos;d take it ,  write his number on the back and hand them out to beautiful women at bars .
 of course only a certain kind of woman responds to that kind of advance and it hit me ,  this mother fucker was fishing for gold diggers .
 they call him and he shows up in his fancy ass car and they &apos;re sold .
 i appreciate that the whole adventure is rather morally dubious but i firmly believe turnabout is fair play .
 it &apos;s a secret ploy to just get everyone to tidy up their living spaces .
 yeah no one &apos;s going to be taking pictures of their bedroom floor if there are clothes all over it .
 machine learning can do face id very well .
  wouldn &apos;t be hard to delete pictures with faces (or even bodies) automatically .
 mine is basic as fuck ,  too .
 but that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been averaging 1 new state a year for the last 3 .
 i sleep on an air mattress because i gave my queen and box spring to a coworker who helped me pack the first time .
 i don &apos;t own anything that i can &apos;t move myself if i have to move again .
 so that does give a good idea about you then ,  your bedroom is basic as fuck because you’re only there to sleep .
 if personalising it was important ,  you would have done it already .
 bedrooms would out some of the cheaters on old too .
 i google at least a dozen words a day just to check the spelling ,  as english is not my first language .
 google history full of single words like  &apos;apparently &apos; or  &apos;subconscious &apos; is exactly the kinda hot tea that would trap anyone in i &apos;m sure .
 i’m the “tech guy” in my family .
 this doesn’t mean i’m a savant with technology or anything ,  but i’ve built my own pc from parts and am vaguely competent around most tech .
 this invariably means everyone in both mine and the missus family contact me every time their phones/ipads/routers/sky tv boxes/etc/etc isn’t working entirely correctly .
 none of them have yet figured out that my usual go to is to google the problem plus the model number of their product and then read the top three answers back to them .
 so yeah ,  70% of my browser history is just boring tech shit .
 cmon ,  this shows off some positive or informative traits !
 - is willing to learn .
 - cares about their cat ,  quite a lot .
 - not a vegetarian/vegan .

 i wasn &apos;t doing as well with showering before my therapist appointments and i guess it got kind of noticeable .

 one of the most miraculous things to ever happen to me .

 i feel like i &apos;m 19 again .
 i’m in this comment and i don’t like it .
 i feel like i &apos;m doing this now .
 i only clean when my son comes to visit .
 for the two weeks in between ,  my sink is full of dishes ,  laundry that needs to be folded on the couch ,  dirty showers/toilets ,  etc .
 i also have stopped cooking and showering every day .
 might make it every two to three days just so i maintain appearances at work .
 i &apos;m really overwhelmed lately .
 i think i &apos;m trying to do too much at once .
 i have no motivation and i can literally lay in bed for hours at a time doing nothing .
 that &apos;s actually why i get a cleaning lady to come biweekly .
 i just moved to a new city so i don &apos;t have anyone to invite over but having to make sure my house isn &apos;t a hoarding garbage dump so she can clean well is keeping me in a much better state of mind .
 well worth the small investment .
 i mean every other week when i say biweekly ,  not twice a week .
 there are a ton of subs on reddit at the moment that revel in mocking the biggest losers in society ,  i used to partake but now i realise it &apos;s absolutely lacking in compassion .
 it &apos;s actually just really sad for those guys that they are like that when they could be functioning members of society .
 i like the times when that sub is supportive of other users to clean their rooms ,  thats what i like to see there
 a walk-on closet
 you know that &apos;s likely genetic ?
 it &apos;s one of the traits i saw tested for on my 23andme test: .
 what is misophonia ?
 almost everyone hates noises like nails on a chalkboard ,  but for people with a condition called misophonia ,  everyday noises like the sound of chewing can cause a similar reaction ,  along with rage or panic .
 some scientists speculate that misophonia could result from increased connections between the brain systems involved in hearing (the auditory cortex) and the  &apos;fight or flight &apos; response (the limbic system and autonomic nervous system) .
 your genotype at one tested marker .
 23andme researchers identified one genetic marker associated with feeling rage at the sound of other people chewing .
 this genetic marker is located near the tenm2 gene which is involved in brain development .
 your genetic variants at this marker are associated with about average odds of having this trait .
 you found the partner that would never ,  ever change the toilet paper roll or even make sure there was toilet paper available .
 tbf ,  if you go to a frat house you shouldn’t expect anything clean .
 went to my friends frat house and i had to drink water out of a measuring cup because they had no clean dishes
 i wish my roommate would understand this .
 i do a light  &apos;surface clean &apos; similar to your 5 minute clean all the time ,  but she won &apos;t touch anything unless shes in full cleaning mode .
 all or nothing .
 i have a super terrible sense of smell ,  but once i went to a guy &apos;s house after a first date and immediately the scent of unwashed laundry and bed sheets slammed me in the face .
 he then proceeded to play the guitar for an hour until i stood up and proclaimed ,   &apos;i have to go feed my cat .
 yeah ,  i went to visit a couple buddies who shared an apartment together and the bathroom had a human hair carpet .
 i made sure never to visit again .
 that is absolutely disgusting .
 like ,  there’s a difference between ,  “oh you have dirty clothes thrown haphazardly around your room and clutter in the living spaces” and “i’m pretty sure you’ve grown new types of bacteria because there is literal trash everywhere” .
 i’m a woman ,  and i know i’m a fairly messy person ,  but i absolutely keep things clean .
 there’s no reason to not do things like throw trash in a garbage can ,  do your dishes ,  and clean the bathroom .
 the difference between clutter and filth is lost on some people and that it terrifying .
 sounds like laziness ,  inertia ,  and sexism .
 some men really see cleaning as women &apos;s work .
 i flip mullets into beards ,  and i also have a long running joke i do by folding the corners in ,  to make it fancy hotel fold .
 no one has mentioned it yet in all my years doing it ,  but i like to think it &apos;s because it hasn &apos;t been figured out who &apos;s doing it ,  not that they &apos;ve known the whole time ,  and upon discovering think ,   &apos;when will she stop this madness ?
 i do it in almost every bathroom i &apos;ve used ,  but my own .
 it makes me snicker a little ,  knowing it &apos;s going to catch the next person off guard ,  like ,   &apos;wow ,  for a piss smelling venue bathroom ,  the tp is lovely !

 i &apos;ve never had almond milk before ,  but in the way back of my cupboard there &apos;s a thing of almond milk that expired in 2016 .
 we &apos;ve been through so much together .
 milk that doesn &apos;t need to be stored in the fridge until it &apos;s opened .
 it is normally kept as a back-up for when/if the normal milk runs out (except if you &apos;re french ,  because they seem to use long life milk as the norm) .
 yeah i feel like freezer has gotta be the move here
 i mean ,  if i know i &apos;m going to eat it by the next day or so then yea fridge is fine
 well let me introduce you to my friend jeffery dahmer .
 here &apos;s another two .
 you &apos;re a godsend for doing this with her .
 my best friend is wonderfully organized and she didn &apos;t understand how much trouble i had with organizing until she was helping me move and saw me stare at a tiny pile of pens and shirts and some miscellaneous things because my brain was too overwhelmed to figure out where they should go .
 it &apos;s such a stupid problem i can &apos;t get around ,  but she was able to give me direction on what i should do with each bit .
 it &apos;s so helpful .
 as someone with add and terrible clutter control issues ,  can agree
 yet another adhd person with clutter problems checking in .
 purging a ton of my stuff slowly and donating to goodwill has helped a bit but it’s a daily struggle that hasn’t been completely “fixed” .
 i wasn’t diagnosed with adhd until i was an adult but i’ve learned strategies and coping mechanisms to be better about the many symptoms of adhd such as clutter .
 for example i keep my shoe rack by the front door where the pile of shoes used to collect .
 don &apos;t worry ,  he &apos;ll be seeing those soon enough .
 that &apos;s covered under the  &apos;children from different mothers/fathers &apos; part .
 op didn &apos;t specify that they had to be alive or in one piece .
 but i have over 1900 hours in one game that i just started playing last may .
 it &apos;s stardew isn &apos;t it ?
 as a 20 something who games a decent amount and is actively on the dating scene ,  i gotta agree with the parent comment .
 it &apos;s not a big deal to talk about it once you &apos;ve gotten to know someone but raving about it on your first dates won &apos;t get you anywhere if they &apos;re not also a gamer or aren &apos;t interested in becoming one .
 i &apos;m also not a big fan of people making gaming a defining part of their identity myself .
 i would question their sanity and life choices .
 because humble bundle keep giving me them !
 because steam sales happen constantly !
 because i have no self control !
 being a collector makes it much much easier for people to buy gifts for you .
 i &apos;m convinced that at least half the people i know who are  &apos;collectors &apos; would rather not be ,  but they made the mistake of saying (e .
 )  &apos;oh yeah i like dalmatians &apos; and it just snowballed over the years .
 i have documentation that u/mrfinnmeister is long ,  alright ?
 the attempt at cooking fish gave them a stroke .
 i have been known to eat the same meal three days in a row because i made way too much soup .
 what if i like food and cooking when i am with someone but when i am alone i can &apos;t do anything past frozen pizza and mac .
 basic vehicle maintenance really oughta be part of driver &apos;s ed .
 there &apos;s plenty of parents out there that don &apos;t teach it to their kids .
 when i was 17 i slung a piston rod through the engine block when the engine on my  &apos;89 wrangler blew .
 i knew you had to change the oil periodically ,  but i didn &apos;t realize there was something going on that made my (older) engine actually burn through oil over time .
 $1 , 500 later ,  i replaced the engine and still have that jeep today .
 although i did have to replace the transmission a few years after that because i screwed that all to hell by dropping the jeep off a four foot embankment while mud bogging .
 (in my defense ,  we were at the power lines and you couldn &apos;t see the drop-off until you were right up on it)
 man she probably wouldn &apos;t have done it even if the oil change fairy came to her face and showed her the future of what would happen if she didn &apos;t .
 and when you consider new cars have a dash light that remind you to change your oil ,  i don &apos;t even know how to turn it off hence its a big incentive to get my oil changed .
 don &apos;t forget jack stands .
  going under a car that &apos;s held up by a jack is extremely  unsafe .
 you also need a oil pan to catch the oil ,  and access to somewhere to dump the oil in an environmentally friendly way .
 and it helps to replace the sump plug washer with each oil change too .
 and you may need an oil filter removal claw thingy .
 a car jack too if you &apos;re not a tiny human .
 and if you are a tiny human like me that can fit beneath your car without a jack ,  still get one (and wheel chocks and jack stands ,  shits dangerous ,  yo) because just because you fit doesnt mean you can get the leverage to unstuck that drain plug .
 seriously ,  just get the stuff .
 you &apos;ll eventually need it for something else anyway ,  better to have on hand .
 keep in mind synthetic lasts much longer if your car uses synthetic !
 5k miles is the recommendation for castor oil .
 synthetics can safely go up to 15k miles or longer .
 you can get em super cheap at certain auctions too
 don &apos;t most of those apps already have access to your location when you are on them ?
 or they think it &apos;s a bit sensationalist ,  especially given all the data that so many apps already have .
 oh alright then ,  no shame in that .
 if you like piña colatas .
 or take a picture of an object to answer a question .
 i would simply not agree to take constant photos like that of myself .
 they &apos;d add up fast and i don &apos;t some app to have 30+ pics of me with the gps enabled .
 i wouldn &apos;t use it .
 because if there &apos;s one thing mtv gives a shit about ,  it &apos;s making sure kids clean their rooms .
 my grandma calls her’s “the equalizer”
 yes that is correct ,  blood and semen etc only glow under blacklight with the application of luminol spray .
 they do not glow on their own
 now i don’t know who to believe

 her: atlas shrugged
 i don’t think certain books should make it an immediate no .
 for example: many people who are interested in modern history ,  particularly ww2 ,  might look into mein kampf .
 that hardly means they support hitler .
 or they might have a book on churchill’s greatest speeches .
 doesn’t mean they’re a fan of his .
 i suppose i just don’t believe that the books you read are necessarily reflective of your views ,  especially as i find it incredibly interesting to learn about and understand different peoples views .
 i don &apos;t see how simply owning some specific book indicates anything about anyones views .
 on the contrary ,  everyone should read books which contradict their currently hold views .
 this way they are forced to re-evaluate and justify their own thinking ,  instead of amassing selective information which serves just to reinforce their current thinking .
 simply put ,  you learn much more when you read books you don &apos;t agree with than when you read books books you already agree with .
 no he wanted minecraft dad .
 well ,  c &apos;mon you have to tell us what the song was !
 i &apos;ve tried to cook places where they literally had salt .
 not pepper ,  just salt .
 no ,  they didn &apos;t cook .
 or they have a cat that likes to unroll it

 and after they actually find out that he &apos;s not loaded ,  they take themselves out of his life without him having to do anything .
 bwahaha i &apos;m a woman and find this absolutely hilarious .
 partially because an advance like that would be a giant red flag for me ,  so yeah ,  if they were calling him just because of the balance on the atm slip ,  that &apos;s totally a fair move in my book .
 it &apos;s only incel if you said that &apos;s the only way to get woman outside of having a model face lol you firmly acknowledge that it &apos;s a specific type of woman he &apos;s attracting so you &apos;re good mate
 so i wouldn &apos;t be able to show a picture of my freezer then .
 english is my main language and i google words everyday  every day for spelling and to check definitions to ensure proper use .
 i’m a housemaid and this would accurately describe more than half of my more well off customers .
 their homes are perfect inside and out- but holy hell once you find the storage rooms and have to take their garbage out through the garage .
 you see some piles of shit hiding .
 it’s not even that it’s bad ,  but it’s like a small twilight zone when you go from a perfect ,  magazine-worthy home ,  to actually seeing their stuff they use in everyday life .
 i couldn’t do it ,  personally .
 but it’s definitely interesting .
 my ex wife thought the dishwasher was like a magic box that would clean anything put inside it regardless of spacing .
 she thought items could touch and even be stacked .
 often she’d have something block the path of the upper sprinkler ,   so it couldn’t spin .
 i always had to rewatch the dishes .
 she also thought cleaning meant stuffing any clutter into drawers and closets ,  regardless of where anything actually belonged .
 a room could look tidy ,  but behind every closet door and in every drawer was a mess of unimaginable dimensions .
 thanks for the gold and all the upvotes — all y’all made my day !
 and ,  yes “rewash” auto-corrected to “rewatch” ,  but i’m leaving it as is .
 putting all the spoons in the same spot can lead to them nesting inside of each other and not being properly cleaned fyi
 if thats so ,  i think you should like it .
 he talked about it in past tense .
 getting a dog did it for me .
 constantly counter surfing so i installed a dishwasher .
 grabbing socks off the floor so the clothes go in a hamper .
 grabbing random items off the coffee table so they get tucked away .
 i have a friend who doesn’t clean for his cleaning lady .
 like leaving chicken bones in the sink and dirty clothes and dishes everywhere .
 once ,  i picked him up at like 3:30 on a friday to go out bar hopping ,  and i asked him if he wanted to maybe tidy up before we left just in case he wanted to bring someone back to his place later and that’s when he told me “ohh cleaning lady will be here in like 15 mins .
 ” i was silently embarrassed for him .
 all the subs about making fun of people are toxic .
 i mean let’s be real .
 the messy room is a symptom .
 considering how many people basically make minimum wage at best ,  having a neat and tidy room doesn’t really qualify you as “functional member of society” .
 this is the first year i’ve maintained a clean room and guess what ,  i’m still getting evicted next week about to be homeless after getting my hours cut .
 having my room be the trainwreck it was last year wouldn’t make me any less “functional” .
 i’m a college grad so i can only guess other people have it even worse than me ,  at least i know what it’s like to just barely be able to afford rent a half year at a time .
 i don’t blame people for effectively dropping out of society .
 i &apos;ve attempted to explain that to people on reddit ,  especially when r/fatpeoplehate was front page content .
 their  &apos;logic &apos; was that bullying would help these people change ,  not understanding that these people obviously do not want to look like they do .
 there &apos;s not just a lack of compassion but also a lack of understanding mental health issues .
 yeah man ,  supportsub .
 the other day a girl posted her ex &apos;s room there and she got scolded for bashing him while she was obviously fine with it while dating him .
 people should be more supportive of others in general .
 whether people are hurting or depressed ,  or not ,  there &apos;s no need for random people on the internet to make them more miserable .
 too often people open their mouths without opening their hearts .
 yeah wtf happened to that sub ?
 seems like it went from people sharing their own neckbeard nests and getting support ,  to reposts from all around reddit of anything remotely trashy .
 it isnt that severe for me ,  thank god ,  but i definitely do feel the effects for a couple minutes afterwards .
 luckily no one i see regularly are loud chewers .
 same as well ,  i get really overwhelmed with sounds often and chewing sounds are something that really triggers me .
 i have a friend who chews really fucking loud and it’s to the point where i relate her face to a feeling of discomfort and anger .
 lol that &apos;s not a date that &apos;s a saturday night live sketch
 i get this completely .
 am also openly messy person but there &apos;s a line i don &apos;t let myself cross you know ?
 my ex claimed to be the same but once she moved in became clear she was dirty ,  not messy .
 i &apos;ve always hated washing up so i &apos;d sometimes leave the odd plate or cup longer than i should ,  but not if there was actual food on it you know ?
 that was a big clash ,  her saying i &apos;m just as bad ,  me saying an empty glass of water or a used sandwich plate is not equivalent to a bowl of leftover pasta ,  for example .
 she just didn &apos;t get it .
 she also filled the bathroom bin with her dirty sanitary pads until it was literally overflowing onto the floor and never took it out ,  i ended up doing it ,  it was pretty much the final straw after that .
 some things you can leave until later ,  stuff that &apos;s going to stink the place up you cannot .
 her mum &apos;s house was hoarder level madness ,  which explained alot in retrospect .
 are you searching for purpose ?
 pointless curses ,  nonsense verses .
 you &apos;ll see purpose start to surface .
 besides the fact that it’s expired ,  isn’t almond milk supposed to be stored in the fridge ?
  &apos;long life milk &apos; in sweden is a cow .
 if you don &apos;t drink the milk with in a week you will have bad yogert .
 who cares about some stupid dismembered humans i wanna see what they do with their leftovers
 my house isn &apos;t trashed (garbage is in the garbage can ,  dishes are generally clean or in the dishwasher ,  etc .
 ) just terribly cluttered because i can &apos;t organize things to save my life .
 i have a wonderful knack for going straight back to a thing i laid down weeks ago in a random spot to make up for it ,  but keeping horizontal surfaces free of random not-garbage bits and bobs is a gigantic challenge for me .
 i completely recommend r/hoarding for a good chat on strategies .
  you don &apos;t have to be as bad as a tv hoarder to find some good ideas .
  (frankly ,  a lot of tv level hoarders are too  &apos;stuff blind &apos; to join a reddit group on the topic .
  so ,  there are tons of family members of hoarders online--for the worst hoards .
 adhd clutter ,  and adhd in general for me ,  is having 100 things you are trying to get done at once ,  and therefore a lot of things never get done ,  and each peice of clutter has some sort of purpose .
  lots of great ideas ,  not enough time !
 the real discovery for me was realizing how much i was buying .
  i was buying a lot of stuff ,  trying to  &apos;be &apos; someone .
  i had to figure out i wasn &apos;t happy and i was aspirationally shopping to make the  &apos;happy person &apos; picture work .
  turns out ,  happiness isn &apos;t available on amazon .
 adhd here ,  this was my life for 25 years .
 but i grew up in a clean ,  clutter-free household ,  so after a certain point clutter made me anxious .
 the way i fixed this is by getting rid of like 4/5ths of my stuff .
 i had so much useless crap that i kept around for no reason ,  and i &apos;ve never missed it .
 you need the right amount of stuff for your space ,  so that every single thing has a sensible place to live .
 this is the problem for most people i know -- they have too much stuff for their space so there &apos;s literally nowhere to put it away .
 after that i just try to do little things to declutter every day .
 if i &apos;m going to the kitchen i &apos;ll take some trash or dishes from the living room ,  if i &apos;m going to my bedroom i &apos;ll take some clothes .
 if you do this every time it becomes natural and you don &apos;t have to make a big effort ,  because things are slowly going back where they belong .
 and then once a week or so i &apos;ll do a big clean ,  but because i &apos;ve been slowly cleaning throughout the week ,  the big clean doesn &apos;t take much energy or time .
 if you let it get out of control then cleaning is a whole big thing that takes hours ,  which makes you less likely to do it next time .
 and because i just don &apos;t own a ton of stuff ,  it doesn &apos;t take that long .
 it &apos;s definitely possible to become organized/clutter-free as an adhd ,  you just have to work at it .
 not a lot ,  but constant small steps built into your life .
  homes for items have to be in the place that it is the least work for the item to  &apos;go home &apos; .
 ive been wanting to try stardew .
 do you know if its any good ?
 and if they spent less ?
 that happened to me with scarves .
 my mom found out i like scarves ,  and for a few years she gave me so many pretty scarves of different types .
 i like them all ,  but living in southern louisiana i have a hard time getting good use out of each one every winter .
 this is me with cat stuff .
 i like cats ,  i &apos;ve always grown up with a least one or two cats and now i have two of my own .
 people have bought me cat stuff (shirts ,  socks ,  mugs ,  etc) that i use so everyone else assumes i love cat stuff and now i look like some crazy cat lady with all the cat-related things i own .
 holy shit i love this so much .
 i &apos;m now only calling it potato sauce
 my daughters would do this ,  they love both mashed potatoes and pasta but refuse to have sauce of any kind on pasta .
 those basic bitches creep me out
 i &apos;m kinda poor but love cooking .
 so i will often make a huge delicious dinner and then eat it several days in a row .
 along with something different but mostly always the same itself for breakfast .
 i know that in some countries it was/is .
 my dad told me that in soviet union ,  you could get license in high school while underage but you also had to learn how the cars work inside out (engines ,  transmissions  ,  suspensions ,   all of it) .
 only once you proved you know it ,  then they gave you a license and you could drive one  .
 kind of a good idea i think .
 they don &apos;t let you shoot guns in the military before you know how to take care of them either
 further to your defense ,  fucking up your jeep by having fun with it is kinda the point of a jeep .
 oil filter removal claw thingy aka filter wrench .
  looks like a weird offset pair of pliers .

 picture of my pet .
 picture of the bus seat pattern .

 it’s weird that i watched that when i was 9 thinking they were so old ,  they’re practically teenagers lol
 i used to be part of a relatively small message board community .
 there was one well known user who made a big deal to brag about how he was going to be on next ,  but mysteriously shut up about it after filming .
 when it aired ,  there was a live thread and he got nexted before he got off the bus
 omg   that was an awesome flashback .
 i miss that show .
 and with all the dating apps out there ,  next doesn &apos;t seem as far fetched of an idea anymore .
 that guy was so wrong ,  i had to next him twice !
 it &apos;s for the church honey ,  next
 my favorite one is toward the end where the girl is saying “you shop more than i do so .
 ” and the guy goes off script and she’s so flustered she just starts her line over .
 every once in a while they would get someone who just didn’t follow the script and caused a little chaos ,  those were the best episodes .
 they typically use luminol for things that have already been cleaned ,  because so many things glow under it that it makes it harder to distinguish between them rather than easier .
 fecal matter and blood both glow with luminol ,  they both appear brown ordinarily ,  luminol wouldn &apos;t differentiate between them ,  and no blacklight is needed that &apos;s just a television thing .
 they use a darkened room and photography
 worked in a porn store and was curious how bad the jack off booths were .
 you 10000000000% dont need a spray to see anything .
  i they get someone local and their room  &apos;meets the criteria &apos; it could be used .
  cast someone out of town ,  and they have a set ready .
 the dozens of dirty magazines in my room does not ,  in any way ,  necessarily reflect my views .
 i &apos;m just curious thats all it is .
 my husband and i have a  &apos;propaganda shelf &apos; that includes various north korean literature ,  the book of mormon ,  jefferson &apos;s bible ,  mao &apos;s red book ,  and others .
 we find that stuff fascinating !
 does it really matter either way as soon as you have a girl over your toilet paper budget will quadruple .
 i don &apos;t normally offer unsolicited english advice on the internet ,  but you said you are interested in proper usage: .
 everyday= common ,  average ,  ordinary; .
 every day= each day .
 and sometimes i’m too lazy to look up a word so i just reword my whole sentence .
 i am constantly finding things like ladles and tupperware facing up so they fill with dirty water .
 also ,  my boyfriend puts huge pots in the dishwasher (ones that take up the entire bottom rack) instead of just giving them a quick rinse in the sink .
 drives me nuts .
 and recleaning those dishes would be even worse since the heater baked all the unwashed bits onto the surface !
 hence the ex part
 i got a roomba ,  that works great for me since i need to keep the floors clean .
 when they &apos;re clean it &apos;s so much easier to keep the rest of the place clean .
 i used to clean for someone like that .
 she was scared of most people .
 her home was hoarder level dirty .
 i would come back and it was like that again .
 she is finally better now .
 one of the nicest ladies you could meet .
 she is actually too generous so i quit visiting so i cant let her give me too much .
 details i failed to include that make it worse: .
 there were handcuffs on the floor .
 some sentences he spoke with a british accent for no reason .
 he started telling me it &apos;s not so bad having a roommate ,  because the bedrooms are so far apart so no one would  &apos;hear us &apos; .
 keep in mind i knew this guy for 3 hours at that point .
 then write something yeah it might be worthless
 no one else is dealing with your demons meaning maybe defeating them could be the begining of your meaning ,  friend
 it says i should after i open it ,  but i could never do that .
 and if they store their milk in the fridge door ,  that &apos;s an absolute deal breaker .
 and the clutter stays cluttered because if there &apos;s a box or a bin that &apos;s just too small or not the right size ,  then there &apos;s clutter that won &apos;t fit ,  so what &apos;s the point !
 (i hate having adhd .
 there’s a difference between messy and dirty .
 i can accept the first but not the second .
 i go through intense periods where i have to collect something .
 i guess it feels like if i get it all i &apos;ll be complete .
 but i get bored ,  look back at the stuff i &apos;ve accumulated and it doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
 like a different person bought it .
 it sucks but not to do it feels worse .
 could be factorio
 do you like minecraft but wish it had a more story based quest line .
 do you like farming simulation games but wish they had a little more action .
 do you like romance / love story games but wish they were more open world where you could do things like bash a tree when you were getting bored of romancing  .
 if yes stardew is for you
 it depends on the games you like ,  if you like games like animal crossing ,  then you &apos;re gonna love stardew valley
 peaceful ,  wholesome as fuck ,  and it &apos;ll basically be as easy/casual or strategic as you want to make it .
 i personally take a middle road and keep the wiki open so i can plan out how i &apos;ll get certain accomplishments or make money faster ,  but you can also just kinda derp around town flirting with npcs if you want .
 super relaxing either way .
 potato sauce is pretty good .
 it feels along the lines of me calling coffee  &apos;bean soup &apos;
 i quit drinking so i will never really get a chance to use this !
 most vodka is grain based .
 good vodka is potatoes ,  but it isn &apos;t all potato sauce
 that not even basic bitchery ,  that &apos;s an advanced technique .
 sounds like a way to screen half my old classmates out of the gene pool .
 truer words were never spoken
 it’s for the church ,  honey !
 in all fairness if i am testing a potential dates room i am also interested in knowing if there is faecal matter on the bedspread .
 everyone knows that you only read playboy for the articles .
 hahah i actually like that song because i loved insidious and horror movies in general .
 my wife loves to blast through a roll of toilet paper then leave the empty roll in the bathroom and not replace it .
 this is actually really good to know ,  and i &apos;m not even the original commenter lol .
 misread ladles as ladies .
 thought you meant that ladies did these things until i read it again xd
 that ,  and i forgot to mention all the things that she put into the magic cleaning box that were ultimately destroyed – wood cutting boards ,  plastic bottles ,  etc .
 that was just the tip of the iceberg .
 photos of her dishwasher may of helped ,  but photos of her actual alcohol consumption would’ve been a game changer .
 that said ,  we created two incredible kids ,  so no regrets .
 also doesn &apos;t poop in the house
 my dad was/is a hoarder ,  and the only way he will get rid of anything is to give it away .
 i clean his home for him a few times a year and go through each item .
 i have baskets and boxes laid out for thrift store ,  metal scrap yard ,  stuff i “want” aka will be secretly thrown out .
 i just wanted you to know that if she gives you stuff ,  it is her way of letting go of things .
 it can be very difficult mentally for hoarders to give up these items because they think it may have a use later or they over-inflate its importance .
 knowing that it is going to a good home helps them let go .
 you &apos;ve gotten much stranger with your work .
 then paint something then ,  it might be wordless
 i didn &apos;t know that i was going to find my broken brain logic in one sentence .
 sounds like a commercial :d
 what about the exact same amount ?
 would that answer change if it was also the exact same collection ,  every game purchased minutes after yours ?
 quitting drinking is better than being able to use a quick joke .
 my wife loves to blast through a roll of toilet paper .
 i &apos;m just imagining a woman laughing with maniacal glee as she pulls the entire roll off in one motion .
 wood cutting boards ?
 a single tear just rolled down my cheek .
 unless the dog poops and then the roomba makes things .
 i try to be very mindful of the impact it has on her .
 thank you for the insight .
 i felt i was taking advantage of her at some point but this makes more sense .
 even after i cut off contact with my ex-mother ,  my brother and nieces were still living in her house .
  she was and apparently continues to be a world class hoarder .
 when she went on vacation for a week ,  i paid for a 30yd dumpster to be dropped in the driveway .
  over the course of a weekend ,  my younger brother filled it just with the stuff from the enclosed porch .
 and he didn &apos;t even empty it entirely .
 she never noticed .
  it didn &apos;t even register with her that so much stuff was gone .
 well ,  what &apos;s the likelihood that both of us are serial killers ?
 pointless curses ,  nonsense verses
 it &apos;s the farthest from the center of the fridge so the theory goes that milk won &apos;t last as long if it &apos;s stored there .
 i never thought about it until wilson on the tv show house had a fight with his girlfriend about it and i was like  &apos;hmm ,  i &apos;m not sure if it &apos;s true but it makes sense to me .
 i now will die on my sword defending that theory .
 now guys ,  hold up ,  let &apos;s take a step back
 i would question my sanity .
 then she is stalking me and guess what ?
 i have a stalker !
 i am so important now !
 i hope she &apos;s cute !
 someone needs to die .
 that was good insight !
  i never thought of it that way before .
 you both sound like top notch women ,  very kind too .
 you &apos;ll see purpose start to surface
 i store my chocolate milk in the fridge door .
 it &apos;ll be gone in 2-3 days anyways .
 i &apos;m definitely an adult who just loves chocolate milk and not three kindergarteners stacked on top of each other .
 but it &apos;s more likely to freeze if it &apos;s in the back where it &apos;s coldest .
 and it &apos;s definitely cold enough in the door .
 maybe you guys just need better fridges .
 he can’t he’s missing his feet , 
 i &apos;m not perfect by any means but i try .
 no one else is dealing with your demons
 what &apos;re you doing here ?
 i thought you had to stay late at the business factory
 if liquid freezes in your fridge ,  you &apos;ve got it set too cold .
 who puts it in the back ?
 put it in front of the fridge

 ron likes to take all his clothes off when he poops .

 hogwarts in the  &apos;60s was a drug-fueled technicolor dancing orgy every night and the only reason it doesn &apos;t come up more often is because not a lot of people clearly remember it .
 harry was born with a third testicle .
 fred came back as a ghost
 harry put his name in the goblet of fire 
 harry and ron used some of hermione &apos;s hair + polyjuice potion to kill some time in the dormitories .
 the reason dumbledore didn &apos;t bring back harry &apos;s parents with the time turner is because dumbledore always wanted a son of his own ,  but then changed his mind a few years later and dumped him at the dursleys

 fred and george weasley switched places during the battle of hogwarts .
  when george died ,  fred adopted george &apos;s life - complete with cutting off his ear - because he figured george wouldn &apos;t want him to spoil the joke .
 buckbeak was a metaphor
 that the cauldron voldemort was rebirthed in during goblet of fire used to belong to horace slughorn .
 it was gifted to his favourite student ,  tom riddle ,  the year riddle left hogwarts .
 after book 2 and the poly juice experiments ron and hermione permanently switched places .
 i &apos;d double down and declare that some of the older teachers at hogwarts would forget they were supposed to use toilets now ,  so occasionally they &apos;d just drop trou and urinate in front of everyone .
 underneath the robe ,  professor mcgonagall is actually two twin dwarfs standing on each other &apos;s shoulders .
 they take turns being on top so the other doesn &apos;t get tired .

 why couldn’t they have had magical outhouses ?
 why did it have to get weird ?
  &apos;the my immortal fanfic is now 100% canon ,  thank you .
 muggle orphanages know about magic and when an orphan shows magical prowess they phone the ministry of magic for pickup and leave the baby outside .
 the ministry hasn &apos;t figured out how voicemail works and never come to pick up the children .
 hermione dresses up as a cat girl for ron ,  who developed a thing for it before they were dating .
 in order to have the feasts so lovingly described ,  house elves of hogwarts had perfected the art of reusing leftovers multiple times .
 they secretly go to cheap restaurants and learn from muggles .
 recently they discovered internet ,  and now dean thomas &apos;s mother prints out for them every tip and trick she can find at  &apos;frugal living &apos; blogs .

 george weasley was adopted .
 not fred though .
 harry doesn’t have a left pinky toe ,  it was the only part of him hurt by the killing curse when he was a baby .
 and then all of us fan theorists will wonder why lilly didn’t love his left pinky toe
 i &apos;d clarify that dumbledore wasn &apos;t really gay ,  just  &apos;gay for pay &apos; .
  figure that way ,  nobody is happy .
  &apos;i &apos;m writing a new book .
 i &apos;ll make her add a lot more lore by bumping community expectations .
 the protagonist was actually the flying car and everything after is just epilogue .
 “i actually always envisioned dumbledore aggressively asking harry ,  maybe even yelling ,  if he put his name in the goblet of fire .

 dobby’s asshole has the same properties as a bag of holding and can expand to accommodate any object no matter the girth
 hermione has been secretly hoarding corn (yes ,  as in corn-on-the-cob) in her room since she was very young .
 even after she left for hogwarts ,  she continued to hoard corn in her dorm .
 she never speaks about it .
 she just quietly collects the vegetable as if it’s second nature .
 one day ,  harry and ron discovered her corn stash .
 since then ,  they frequently ask her about why she collects corn ,  but she pretends she never heard that and keeps talking to them about the things they were previously discussing .
 that the hufflepuff common room had an orgy pit .
 ron’s feet squeak like clowns’ feet wherever he walks .
 it echos in the halls of hogwarts .

 harry became a minecraft let &apos;s player after he left hogwarts 
 in the late 90’s ,  an american wizard decided to invent padded grips that a witch or wizard could slip onto their wand for personal preference and a better handle on casting their spells .
 the product was called a “woodie” ,  and arthur weasley ,  with his extensive interest in muggle items and lingo ,  was the only one who seemed to find it hilarious .
 harry was origanlly supposed to be latino  , 
 the weasley family car is actually related to lightning mcqueen and hirby

 witches and wizards have microscopic beings called magi-chlorians that live within their bodies which grant them access to magic .

 blast-ended skrewts all have syphilis 
 it is never specified that harry is male .
 harry converts to islam .
 cursed child isn’t canon ,  harry obviously is tired of fighting dark wizards so after he goes to his 7th year at hogwarts( mcgonagall lets them all come back for a do over) he goes pro in quidditch and wins several world cups for england ,  when he retires he goes back to hogwarts to teach defense against the dark arts and prank everyone using the map and cloak .
  ron goes to work with the dragons ,  hermione compiles the wizard version of wikipedia/google centralizing wizard knowledge and then goes to wizard law school ,  then becomes minister of magic later in life .
 this is pretty much my canon regardless of what other nonsense has been said so the rest of the world can agree with me now 
 that neville was the true chosen one all along .
 dumbledore just chose harry (a similarly qualified child) to groom because he was in love with james potter .
 a scene after the deathly hallows ending ,  revealing paramedics pulling a limp 11 year old harry potter from the cupboard under the stairs ,  and resuscitating him from carbon monoxide poisoning due to the leaky furnace .
 young harry says  &apos;i had the most wonderful dream ,  i was a wizard !
  &apos; ,  uncle vernon exclaims  &apos;you &apos;re going to pay for the rescue wagon .
 and you probably broke the furnace too &apos; .
  aunt petunia calls him an insufferable child .
  dudley laughs while eating an entire pie ,  calls harry a wanker
 my new series about a man with a scraggly beard who spends most of each day making clay bowls ,  mugs ,  and other earthenware .
 after the events of the seventh book ,  as part of therapy ,  harry became proficient at bridge ,  the muggle card game .
 he attended several tournaments wearing hats to hide his scar ,  but no one really cared .
 he would rent a hotel room for whole weekends .
 ginny understood it was something harry needed for himself ,  and the understanding was that there was to be no communication between them during his  &apos;bridge-cations &apos; .
 he met an older woman at a tournament in leeds and had a one night-stand with her .
 she ended up pregnant ,  which was a surprise for both of them .
 he brewed her an abortion potion but she refused to take it ,  promising harry the baby would never interfere with his wizard life .
 she ended up losing the child to a miscarriage in the third trimester .
 she never told harry ,  or spoke to him ever again .
 after the stress of the pregnancy ,  harry never played competitive bridge again ,  but he &apos;d get a muggle paper delivered to his house in order to read the bridge column .
 ginny saw him crying to himself one morning and desperately wanted to ask ,  but the rift between them was already unspeakably wide and she had secrets of her own .
 there is a fantastic beast called “jar jar binks” that is very important that was present during the famous battle between dumbledore and grindelwald .
 the fourth unforgivable curse lets you say the n word .
 harry potter wasn’t gay ,  but he was really into looking at ballsacks and often paid male models to just stand around his home nude when he was an adult .

 my first silver !
 you have my gratitude ,  kind stranger
 honestly ,  i &apos;m in for this !
 snape snape severus snape
 i love this because he was so committed he let himself be executed in the original timeline .
 also ,  inexplicably ,  that &apos;s ginny &apos;s as well
 ok now some needs to do a fanfic where hagrid teaches sex ed i don’t mean an nc17 thing either i mean a legitimate humorous story 
 someone on reddit wrote a little fic where snape gave a sex-ed course .
 it was fucking gold .
 “yeh’ve got ter stroke ‘em , ” said hagrid ,  as though this was the most obvious thing in the world .
 -an actual hagrid quote takenoutofcontext
 and that leads to the whole  &apos;willy wonka is a prequel to snow piercer &apos; theory 
 what happens when plastic straws are banned ?
 it was really him and not the weasleys who wrote and mailed the letter inviting him to the quiddich world cup .
 all those stamps on the envelope were his way getting back at james .
  &apos;i &apos;ve got a secret affliction ,  harry .
 in years where the hat is in an especially bad mood ,  it will reverse the effect ,  giving all of the new students head lice ,  requiring a massive week &apos;s undertaking with ministry of magic assistance to clean the entire castle .
 that is 1000 times better than most of the shit we &apos;ve gotten
 oddly enough i have a friend who’s been compared to ron many times who also does this
 not gonna lie ,  i do too when given the chance .
 that explains why fudge and malfoy send hagrid straight to azkaban without a trial in book two when they walk into hagrid’s hut while harry and ron are hiding .
 nagini being a cursed korean lady .
 that must be when dumbledore made the switch from sharp looking suits to colorful flowy robes .
 but only ever shows up to mess with george when no one else is around as part of an ongoing prank on his early brother .
 and the portion of voldemort &apos;s soul in him allowed him to do so because it was old enough .
 how do you know ?
 did you ask him calmly ?
  &apos;that was great ,   ron .
  i promise i &apos;ll be hermione next time .
  &apos;you always say that .
 time to close reddit
 that &apos;s when harry suddenly developped his taste for redheads
 there’s a solid book that could be written about dumbledore’s attempts to defeat voldemort through time-travel .
 in the end ,  he had to choose to sacrifice his own life to make sure it happened .
 this is so delightfully pointless .
 and then says “i should not have said that .
 oh wait ,  her name was cho .
 i had the wrong image in my head .
 every so often a player has to retire because a snitch goes somewhere where you don &apos;t usually want a vibrating golden orb ,  and frankly theres no returning from that ignominy .

 affectionately known as “krum bum”
 with sidekicks roberta beasley and herman danger
 isn &apos;t it in the books that there actually is a book series about a muggle ?
 called  &apos;michael the mad muggle &apos; or something stupid like that .
 i &apos;m sure i recall this .
 battling to defeat the evil vlad demort ,  who shot him with a 9mm as a baby but his mom put a vest on him .
 makes sense as to why george ended up marrying angelina johnson when it was fred who dated her at hogwarts .
 you monster why would you make everyone cry like that
 there &apos;s actual lore that george could no longer cast a patronus after fred died .
 as an identical twin myself ,  that hit home .
 alternatively harry is flat broke at the end of book 7 and lives a life of complete poverty .
 you see the wizzarding bank was no longer willing to do business with the man who strolled in the front door and robbed the fuck out of them .
 since goblins can &apos;t use wands they also siezed all funds from harry &apos;s vault to pay wizzards to repair the damages .
 that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable piece of info ,  though
 everyone else in here talking about literal feces and voldemort &apos;s foreskin ,  and you come in with some genuine canon .
 after book 2 ,  ron and hermione used each other &apos;s dna to turn into each other and then have freaky body swap sex .
 after book 2 ,  hermione realizes she loves harry ,  and convinces ginny to permanently switch with ron &apos;s body .
 so harry and hermione end up together ,  and ron and ginny do as well ,  but in other bodies so it &apos;s okay .
 just noticed she never had anyone swap genders using polyjuice potion .
 wait no fleur and hermione did at the beginning of book 7 .
  and not a single mention of a dick joke by either of them ,  they have more self-control than any of us
 mcgonagall began wearing diapers as a temporary measure ,  as she believed toilets were just a fad and would soon quickly fall out of favor for the previous vanishing techniques
 i would like one alcohol please .
 he &apos;s like a smooth ken doll down there .
 well there goes all of my fanfic
 actually ,  the fantastic beasts and where to find them textbook from the hogwarts library set (not the screenplay) specifies that the loch ness monster was a kelpie (i think .
 it may have been one of the other creatures)
 what a fucking monster
 how does that explain cedric diggory ?
 this is the best ,  worst response to this question .
 i thought this was canon ?
 the preps will not be happy about this .
 just googled this and skimmed the first page before noping out .
 there &apos;s such a thing as too much cringe .
 apparently internet historian has done a dramatic reading of it ,  i &apos;ll check it out
  &apos;because i love him &apos;
 the first sentence of the plot summary on wikipedia tells me all i need to know about the fanfic .
 the protagonist of the story is ebony (occasionally enoby ,  eboby ,  evony ,  ebory ,  enobby ,  enopby ,  egogy ,  tara ,  or taebory) 
 well this explains why the white walkers keep sparing the orphanages
 it bothered the fuck out of me that plenty of muggles knew about magic and magic users (since apparently you don’t need to be born from at least one magic-user) but it’s still a big secret .
 there is literally nothing stopping a group that knows about it from spilling the beans ,  as even two non-magic parents are let into the loop .
 and hermione gets inspiration for her numerous dedicated costumes and such from hentai ,  which is why she works tirelessly to keep ron intimidated by computers and the internet .
 didn &apos;t the snake hide in some ancient plumbing ?
 she actually tweeted this ?
 can i just correct something quick .
 hogwarts didn &apos;t have indoor plumbing until the 18th century .
 implying that other places were probably more in line with modern plumbing standards ,  but it was more like a sick joke the teachers tell the students .
 plus ,  what about year 1s ?
 the first dump you drop when you &apos;ve only been there for an hour and don &apos;t even know any spells ?
 who tf takes care of that one ?
 anyways ,  this got rambly .
 2nd most upvoted comment about poop .
 i &apos;m ok with this .
 so many things about that don &apos;t make sense .
 who wants to poop with other people watching ?
 who wants someone pooping while they &apos;re watching ?
 how do you wipe ?
  carry around tp everywhere ,  or do you apperate uncomfortably close to your anus ?
  if so ,  what if you teleport a little too much too close ?
 what do you do about the smell during and after the act ?
 do you just wingardium leviosa your robes the whole time while you &apos;re doing it ?
 the whole thing ,  even accounting for magic poop disappearing spells ,  just does not make sense .
 explains why she &apos;s incredibly horny for the guys .
 i gave this some thought ,  and if i was in a boarding school and a ghost wanted to fuck me .
 i &apos;d probably do it .
  it would have to beat jerking off in the communal bed the dorms share .
 and that’s why she is thirsty as fuck for harry .
 i went to universal studios japan last year and moaning myrtle was in the bathrooms ,  but in japanese .
 imagine peeing while hearing anime moaning voices
 i want this to be at the top
 one of my favorite quotes from any piece of harry potter media comes from an interview of the actors who played fred and george &apos; .
  &apos;so are you two actually twins in real life ?
 we actually met at the audition .
 that line kills me every time
 this is definitely my favorite response
 fred actually did have a twin brother but he died as an infant .
 beset by grief ,  arthur and molly decided to adopt a baby of the same age ,  but in order to shelter bill ,  charlie and percy from the death of their younger brother ,  they began doping the new child with polyjuice made from fred’s foreskin .
 (new) george has been doped with polyjuice his entire life ,  and hasn’t been in his original body since he was 3 years old ,  and hence has no idea that he is actually an asian woman .
 he 100% believes that he is george weasley ,  twin brother of fred and son of arthur and molly .
 or better: george was created when fred got into some kind of magical accident .
 now that you mention it ,  why didn &apos;t lily love the lightning bolt shaped patch of skin on harry &apos;s forehead ?
 have you never heard the story of achilles ?
 obviously lilly was holding harry still by his left pinky toe so that part of his body never got protected by her love .
 well technically she is ,  just not hp ,  she &apos;s currently writing a crime novel ,  which should have released last year
 harry potter is cars 3 .
 the flying car only appeared in book 2 ,  so was everything before just a prologue ?
  &apos; dumbledore asked calmly .
 the fanbase would have a cow .
 it would be george lucas claiming he always wanted greedo to shoot first all over again .
 “don’t fucking lie to me ,  harry !
 this is my first silver ,  so thankyou to the fellow potterhead who chose to gift it to me !
 and krum went with it because he &apos;s hugely unstable .
 i &apos;ll tap 3 to play my plain walker ,  gavin the accountant triggering the effect off my derek from hr adding 1 +1/+1 counter to every office worker on the battlefield .
 okay ,  who the fuck played gild ?
 that card was banned from standard during the bronze age expansion .
 edit 2: i fully endorse the discord server someone posted in reply to my comment
 it balances out the weight from his long bottom obviously .
 no the point is to say something that isn &apos;t already canon .
 that wouldn’t rile anyone up .
 now if you said that ron and hermione were anti vaccination .
 not sure if you actually mean fluffy ,  the giant three headed dog ,  or fang ,  hagrid &apos;s actual pet dog .
 hermione &apos;s in a wheelchair
 this is a reference to the gus johnson skit  &apos;jk rowling these days &apos; or something to that effect
 for some strange reason ,  this one is my favourite of all .
 also ,  why do you need two sheds ?
 molly sneaks into his room at night to maintain the spell that keeps him ginger
 how did he defeat the staircases that turned into ramps ?
 its the most impenetrable security system ever invented .
 just think ,  if only gringots had used ramp staircases .
 what else are you supposed to do with an invisibility cloak and the marauder &apos;s map ?
 okay this one is the best !
 she made herself a horcrux as well as prince phillip and she is now the most powerful witch in all of europe .
 you &apos;ve just made my day .
 they best make a movie out of this .
 honestly yeah that seems entirely plausible .
 it would probably even have been ron that first suggested it ,  that kinky ginger snack .
 his reasoning is that snakes don &apos;t have hoods .
 i read  &apos;violently &apos; instead of  &apos;voluntarily &apos; which i think makes it even worse .
 and he liked it so much he had his nose done later on
 there are dozens of them !
 i think i just blue myself !
 “does this cloak effectively hide my thunder ?
 i mean goblins are really weird so i &apos;m not surprised
 its like orks in 40k ,  they bud like fungus :d 
 you know that &apos;s what he calls her when they &apos;re getting kinky and he &apos;s smacking her ass while she gets it from behind .
  &apos;tell daddy who &apos;s a dirty little mudblood !
  one of you sick fucks gave me silver for this .
 y &apos;all are disgusting .
 pm me for more; i &apos;ve got a whole series written .
 go one step further and declare it is an in-universe book written by rita skeeter .
 and the sigh of relief has swept through the diner !
 people were ecstatic !
 it was like the liberation of france !
 there are an unfortunate number of fanfics that would suddenly become canon-compliant ,  were this the case .
 this isn &apos;t true for all house-elves ,  just dobby .
 that kind of fits .
 i thought they got high smoking unicorn horn
 yer a dealer ,  harry !
 and nobody is actually at a magic school at all ,  they are all just stoned af
 you seem to have a misunderstanding of how well arthur understands muggles .
 harry was latino because i never ever mentioned his race !
 ignore the cover art ,  that isn &apos;t cannon .
 and ignore the times that i described him .
 fun fact guys ,  i’ve met latino people before .
 alternately ,  hagrid has no hair from the neck down ,  and he doesn’t need to shave .
 like a porpoise .
 all i can picture now is a robeless brunette ice king
 witches don’t use tampons or pads ,  but instead let their menses run free and just magic away the stains .
 like a 7ft spaghetti noodle .
 that would at least give more credibility to the death eaters beliefs that muggle borns are just muggles who stole magic from wizards .
 they just had a blood transfusion !
 in the same vein .
 harry no longer employs house elves ,  he &apos;s found other helpers .
 here comes one right now .
  &apos;mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again ,  harry .
 happier den mesa seein her in a longo time .
 we will put you in charge of hogwarts ,  but we do not grant you the title of headmaster .
 they said unnecessary .
  this deserves its own book series .
 if this makes dolores umbridge big mom ,  i totally support this .
 magic is real o_o
 in-cannon ,  dead serious ,  the book implies that dude banged goats ?
 did i read that right ?
 it is never specified that harry is a human being .
 he was a talking dog all along ,  which is why he was made to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs in the first place ,  and why hagrid was the one to find him and bring him to hogwarts .
 (not sure what this means about his parents) .
 edit/ps:  &apos;the (good) boy who lived &apos;
 harry converts to scientology .
 this is so evil it &apos;s great .
 is it like narnia where harry was in dream world for actual years ?
 all of his friendships ,  gone .
 his children ,  gone .
 his magic ,  gone .
 still gone but this time actually from a car crash .
 that was his other fetish .
 and strangely enough ,  ginny’s left index finger is harry’s favorite .
 magic dies from the world .
 most of the shit we’ve gotten has been on the floor  .
 how do you know ?
 naked poopers ,  unite !
  &apos;alright so we are just going to give him a warn - why are there two naked kids huddled in a corner the fuck hagrid ?
  &apos;  &apos;askaban it is .
 that also explains that dumbledore looked at harry under the cloak ,  and harry could feel his  &apos;blue eyes pierce him as if he saw him &apos; .
 watch the newest fantastic beasts movie
 puddlemere united sorority sisters yearbook .
 just imagine dumbledore on a rave !
 so an old guy was inside a minor for a long time ?
 god ,  i regret writing this .
 #did you put you fucking name in the goblet you little cunt !
 i pictured they both drank it at the same time .
 and then the real hermione walks in .
 i have been corrupted .
 and open fanfiction .
 it wore off too soon one time and shit got weird .
 fun fact ,  most snakes have two penises .
 and most snakes &apos; penises are double headed .
 and most of those are spiked .
 the golden snatch
 a wacky muggle adventure written from the perspective of a witch sounds like an amazing children book
 it was a comic book series called  &apos;the misadventures of martin miggs ,  the mad muggle .
  &apos; harry sees several copies in ron &apos;s bedroom in the second book .
 they both dated her ,  she only thought she was only dating fred .
 half the fun would be reading the replies people come up with .
 elizabeth warren &apos;s tax plan ,  he only ever attacks wealthy heir draco .
 “you could be killed !
 or worse ,  expelled” - ron
 reminds me of the futurama episode with the brain-swapping .
 in a side plot: fry and leela (now dating) change bodies with various people to prove that they love each other no matter what the other looks like .
 it escalates until one of them is the professor and one of them is zoidberg and they have sex .
 if ginny switched bodies with ron ,  then hermione would be with ginny and harry would be with ron .
 i think you meant ginny switch with hermoine &apos;s body lmao
 a wand inserted deftly into the urethra takes care of all the mess without making a scene 
 so ,  how was your day at the stock market ?
 maybe it &apos;s why he is so angry all the time .
  &apos;you cost me my dick ,  harry potter !
 think the large water creature in the new fantastic beasts was a sizeable kelpie .
 looked reminiscent of the loch ness monster as well .
 g as in g ,  instead of g as in g 
 cedric converts to vampirism from magicism
 it &apos;s the perfect combination of batshit crazy and utter nonsense that jkrowling seems to be aiming for
 i raised my middle finger at them
 aw come on ,  you didn &apos;t even get to the good part !
 what is the good part .
 personally ,  my favorite is dumblydore finding draco taking ebony &apos;s  &apos;virility &apos; in the forbidden forest and screaming  &apos;what the hell are you doing ,  you motherfuckers ?
 loopin and snap also have a very interesting partnership .
 we don &apos;t know anything about the author/intent of the fanfic ,  but the consensus is 99% that it &apos;s the greatest troll fanfic ever written
 grab some beer and friends and take turns reading it !
 it &apos;s a masterpiece you don &apos;t want to miss out on
 if you don &apos;t want to read it ,  you should watch it .
 some guy on youtube(internethistorian i think)  made a 3 part video reading it and it &apos;s brought me to tears
 it starts with  &apos;hi my name is ebony dark &apos;ness dementia raven way ,  &apos; and it &apos;s all downhill from there .
 i’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and i wear mostly black .
 i love hot topic and i buy all my clothes from there .
 for example today i was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt ,  pink fishnets and black combat boots .
 i was wearing black lipstick ,  white foundation ,  black eyeliner and red eye shadow .
 self-insert mary sue enters hogwarts and turns it into her hormone-fueled dreamland of angst and spelling errors .
 harry is a vampire and has gay sex with draco who falls in love with the mary sue protagonist .
 they both attend a good charlotte concert in hogsmeade then have sex in the forbidden forest .
 also dumbledore catches them in the act then calls them motherfuckers .
 there &apos;s a shit ton more that &apos;s supposed to happen like hagrid is a student again ,  butt naked draco with his giant dick interrupting mcgonagall &apos;s class ,  voldemort firing a gun ,  etc .
 10/10 crossover episode
 yeah there &apos;s no way harry was the only abused child left with/born to muggles that hated or distrusted magic .
 but it probably gained sentience and mutated into a creature .
 it became umbridge
 there &apos;s a follow up tweet to that stating that they discovered the entrance when installing the plumbing  .
 and it was the heir to slytherin who was helping with construction to keep it hidden
 you just know filch gonna snatch up your first year turds .
 he aint even wait till its fully out damn .
 why not just teleport it directly out of your bowels before you even poop in the first place ?
 and what about children that haven &apos;t been to hogwarts yet ?
 when mom and dad get home from work they just have to walk around banishing random piles of shit sitting everywhere ?
 and also why the bathroom floor is always wet
 she left it out because she didn &apos;t wanna have to answer questions about the physics of a ghost masturbating .
 hard to pee when you’re rock hard 
 that &apos;s her prefered place too .
 it’s that line right there that solidifies my opinion that they were _perfect_ for the role of fred and george .
  &apos;no it &apos;s funny .
 we actually met at the audition .
 do you have a source for this ?
 can &apos;t find it ,  aside from one hit on tumblr .
 are the actors names joey tribiani and carl ,  by any chance ?
 he &apos;s secretly fed polyjuice potion
  &apos;mom can you give me a goodnight kiss ?
  &apos;sure honey ,  as long as it &apos;s not on your forehead &apos; .
  &apos;there &apos;s a small and deliberately shaped patch of skin there which i have absolutely zero love for and i might accidentally touch that revolting thing &apos; .
  &apos;my robe doesn &apos;t come off that easily .
 you have to warm a girl up first .
 offer me a butterbeer .
 tell me my beard looks lovely today !
 she also published  &apos;a casual vacancy &apos; .
 what is it with british writers and crime novels ?
  &apos;harry you little shit did you put your name in the fucking goblet of fire ,  you &apos;d better not have you fucking cunt ,  do you know how hard it will be to get the ministry off my arse after this little prank of yours &apos; .
 -dumbledore asked calmly
 no ,  krum &apos;s a delusion too ,  harry and ron just decide they need to feel jealousy to experience their sexual awakening so they compile a list of attractive characteristics and make them into viktor .
 harry:  &apos;so ,  like ,  he plays quidditch .
 and he &apos;s super famous .
 ron:  &apos;and his head is totally shaved and he &apos;s from somewhere hot like bulgaria &apos;
 harry  &apos; &apos;damn its an all boys school ,   well lefty your name is now hermione &apos; ,    .
 ron  &apos;hey you named your lefty hermione as well ?
 ye  &apos;(mimes his hand speaking)  hello i am hermione i like boobs .
 i mean books i really really like books .
 i play a grey office ,  then tap it and two others and play my jason from management .
 i activate his ability for 2 .
 take 2 damage for all rule violations .
 mrs norris just takes whatever she can get these days .
 guess which character is actually gay
 that skit made me laugh so hard and it’s so hard to explain to someone else what was funny about it .
 she had a child named ron who looked just like ron that died ,  so she used obliviate on some random kid and sneaks pollyjuice into his breakfast every morning .
 just cast a spell on himself  &apos;wingaurdium leviosa &apos; .
 float over the stairs .
 come at it from above .

 i won’t lie ,  i laughed out loud ,  but i still feel like this was a missed opportunity for circumsempra 
 this is brilliant and would make so much more sense than that absolute dumpster fire did .
 when we went back .
 anything over 0 is an unfortunate number though so .
 follow the spiders .
 they’ll lead you to the meth lab .
 stupid sexy hagrid
 witches now use magic to re-absorb menses in a perfect rewind of how it comes out ,  rather than let it go to waste 
  &apos;harry &apos;s magi-chlorian count is off the charts .
  even professor dumbledore doesn &apos;t have a magi-chlorian count that high .
 it wasn &apos;t from the sex ,  it was a blood transfusion !
  did you put your name in the goblet of fire ?
  &apos;uh oh ,  yousa in big doodoo dis time !
 yousa wizzie harrie
 dave chappelle and the horn of africa sounds like a great first title .
 even as a kid it was blatantly obvious .
 the double twist is it turns out hogwarts is real ,  an owl arrives with the invitation to come to school and learn to be a wizard .
  it &apos;s for dudley .
 i have a friend is code for  &apos;it &apos;s me &apos;
 which is why the centaurs have such a low opinion of wizards .
 i &apos;m gonna put mah dick in the owl
 hey ,  not a fun fact
  &apos;oh no &apos; cried sleve mcdichel ,  the small fat child who could not fly .
  &apos;we are surrounded by criminals and wild animals and homework !
 his best friend todd bonzalez eyed the  rhinoceros burglar nervously .
  &apos;well we can &apos;t fly away ,  that &apos;s for sure !
 honestly seems like the kind of thing that would realistically be somewhere in the world ,  and making muggle inventions sound like a different kind of magic all their own .
  recall how little pureblood wizards seemed to know about things like guns or cars or playstations .
  imagine the stuff a wizard children &apos;s book could bs with that .
 anyone got that image of dan radcliffe with the insane grin and the guns ?
 she knew ,  it was only the rest of the school who was fooled .
 wasn &apos;t harry also a wealthy heir ?
 that’s the one i should have gone with .
 washbucket has always loved scruffy .
 now we are reaching anime territory .
 you’re forgetting the original ron-hermoine switch .
 so ron body hermoine convinces ginny to swap bodies .
 hermoine becomes ginny ,  ginny becomes ron .
 this hermoine body ron and ron body ginny are paired ,  as are harry body harry and ginny body hermoine .
 it’s definitely anime levels of fuckery at this point .
 they said what they meant ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
 i need an adult .
 i did several businesses
 given how crazy bellatrix is that must be a hell of a loss .
 nah when he died he turned into a vampire
 the goffs ,  on the other hand ,  are ecstatic .
 he had a headache ,  okay ?
 “what the hell are you doing ,  you motherfuckers ?
  &apos; he asked calmly .
 yeah the best part is totally when snap asks enoby for a condom ,  but she says “ewww you’ll probably use it on some 6 year old u pedo , ” but then she finds him having sex with loopin ,  so she exclaims “that’s what you were gonna use the condom for !
 ” and snap doesn’t stop but angrily says “yeah but youuuuuu wouldn’t give me one !
 all while dobby is watching them for some reason .
 or something like that ,  it’s been a while since i read it .
 my favorite part is how they dress up the characters in real time based on exactly how she describes their outfits with the stock music playing       .
 also ,   &apos;i gasped &apos;      .
 and the fact that she &apos;s t-posing through literally the entire thing .
 truly a materpiece .
 i have to go read that .
 uphill you mean !
 there &apos;s lots of gratuitous goth fashion ,  ebony has people falling in love with her all the time and falling out of love if they become bad guys ,  and also people are vampires for some reason .
 and did i mention the gratuitous goth fashion ?
 there were definitely more spelling mistakes than that .
 don &apos;t remind me of that bitch ,  she was the first fictional character i ever hated .
 oh man ,  that follow up tweet tho .
 so they &apos;re saying that some random-ass pluming wizards accidentally discovered the entrance to the chamber of secrets ,  ignored it ,  plumbed in some sweetass sinks (one with a snake on the tap) and then .
 enchanted them to move out of the way when the correct word was spoken .
 in a language that few people could speak .
 i don &apos;t even know why it bothers me so much .
 i disembarked from the jk rowling express after reading the epilogue of book 7 .
 but this is the one that always pulls me back in .
 every bloody time .
 cough slightly when you &apos;re casting the spell ?
 your intestines rocket out your arse .
 i’d assume the ghosts were corporeal to themselves and other ghosts .
 assuming she wasn’t using some sorta sex toy she could’ve continued doing it forever
 since walking through a ghost is like dunking your body in ice water ,  that would be incredibly uncomfortable .
 in 2000 ,  at age 14 ,  the twins skipped school exams to attend an open audition ,  despite having no previous acting experience ,  and ,  after about six auditions ,  were cast as fred and george weasley in the film harry potter and the philosopher &apos;s stone .
 they went on to play their characters in all of the subsequent harry potter films .
 this even sounds like something fred and george would do lol
 my wife feels the same way about my penis ,  unfortunately .
 she &apos;s been writing a series of detective novels under the pen name robert galbraith .
 the fourth (out of seven ,  i think) came out a couple months ago .
 just keep extrapolating on that .
 everything magical and then some in all of the books are just vivid hallucinations of two kids with severe mental issues .
  harry isn &apos;t actually an orphan ,  his parents love him very much and wish he &apos;d stop  wandering off for weeks at a time and hiding from them under the stairs .
 he used to go by  &apos;hergrid &apos;
 i’m getting crimes of grindelwald flashbacks .
 but this at least seems more plausible .
 some might even say ,  _slither_ in
 how else do you make a horcrux ?
 50 shades of granger ftfy
 luna’s mother died inventing new spells .
 some spells are worse than death 
 he also wears a fat suit to hid the fact that it &apos;s only his ass that &apos;s enormous .
  &apos;that can &apos;t be right .
 we &apos;ll have to take him down to the ministry .
 their wands are properly calibrated for this sort of thing .
 they &apos;ll be taking him to the council of wizards
 this is the most fucked up thing i &apos;ve read in this thread ,  man .
 is that meant to be a .
 but it &apos;s so small !
 i did that when i was younger ,  that was a bad move ,   .
 thank you for subscribing to snake penis facts .
  &apos;i open at the close &apos;
 this sounds like it could have come out of that algorithm based ,  chat bot thing that has been spewing out harry potter books .
 that headcanon or legit ?
 it &apos;s wrong ,  wash bucket .
 oh ,  it would be sweet for a while ,  but in the back of our minds we &apos;d always know that i &apos;m a man and you &apos;re janitorial equipment .
 and meant what they said
 my favourite thing about it is the author’s notes at the start of each section ,  because she justifies dumbledore swearing there by saying he had a headache .
 and then in a later chapter when he swears again she says something along the lines of “and he didn’t even have a headache this time” .
 i &apos;m sorry ,  what ?
 is it really fanfic at this point or is it just taking the piss ?
 draco leaned in extra-close and i looked into his gothic red eyes (he was wearing color contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly i didn &apos;t feel mad anymore .
 and then… suddenly just as i draco kissed me passionately .
 draco climbed on top of me and we started to make out keenly against a tree .
 he took of my top and i took of his clothes .
 i even took of my bra .
 then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time .
 i was beginning to get an orgasm .
 we started to kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm .
  &apos;what the hell are you doing you motherfukers !
 edit wow someone spent money to tell me that i did a good job of copy and pasting .
 rowling did an excellent job writing that character imo 
 but that even contradicts cannon because it’s already stated slytherin purposely put it there so he could use the pipes to move undetected 
 what if they actually are fred & george ?
 is it just me ,  or are some of her questions really weird ?
 thanks ,  i hate it .
 this is canon in my head now .
 i always wondered how new spells were made in the hp world 
 did you ever hear the tragedy of lord tom the riddle ?
 it &apos;s not a story the mom would tell you .
 it &apos;s a death eaters legend .
 lord tom was a dark wizard of the coast ,  so powerful and so wise he could use the wand to influence the magichlorians to create life… he had such a knowledge of the wizard side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying .
 the wizard side of the magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural .
 he became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power ,  which eventually ,  of course ,  he did .
 unfortunately ,  he taught his apprentice everything he knew ,  then his apprentice killed him in his sleep .
 he could save others from death ,  but not himself .
 what have you done
 i miss ron wearing the rons ron shirt .
 in a different city ,  we could be whoever we wanted .
 pulitzer prize level shit right here
 if you enjoy that reaction ,  you &apos;ll love this fanfic .
 i mean the first chapter is ebony meeting draco ,  a long paragraph describing her elaborate outfit ,  and then ebony and draco saying bye .
 like they just said hello ,  and then immediately good bye .
 it must be parody and yet .
 i &apos;d rather have my boss catch me watching actual porn than having to explain reading that fanfic to him .
 and then… suddenly just as i draco kissed me passionately .
 draco climbed on top of me and we started to make out keenly against a tree .
 he took of my top and i took of his clothes .
 i even took of my bra .
 then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time .
 i was beginning to get an orgasm .
 we started to kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm .
  &apos;what the hell are you doing you motherfukers !
 there are vague (extremely poorly described) sexual situations .
 is this from the fanfic
 this is an abomination .
 this is a crime against both god and science .
 she is the most easy to hate character i &apos;ve ever encountered in fiction because she is someone we &apos;ve all had to deal with before
 they weren &apos;t plumbing pipes ,  obviously ,  they were .
 built specifically for giant deadly snakes to move around in .
 interviewers ask the questions they think their audience would want answered .
 either she doesn &apos;t know her audience ,  or she _really_ knows her audience .
 well you get a hint of that in the half blood prince .
 they combine words and feeling to get the effect they want .
 sometimes crossing out failure combination .
 sectumsempra is an original spell created by snape .
 you could make a religion out of this !
 go ,  before i beg you to stay
 yeah ,  there &apos;s no way anyone wrote that with a serious face .
 and anyone that reads it whilst maintaining a serious face needs help .
 i didn &apos;t make it half way down the first page .
 then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time .
  &apos;and then he put his thingy in my you-know-what and we did it &apos; .
 almost an exact quote .
 in that ,  insufferable kid that might be more extreme but everyone knew atleast one of those growing up that if they were king they &apos;d crossbow bolt people for giggles .
 this will never not make me laugh
 just noticed that at hogwarts there is no art curriculum or any encouragement to explore or invent .
 the weasley twins were the only students pushing the magical envelope .
 even the school &apos;s punishments were so consistent that they could factor failure into any win/loss scenario .
 he has a 9 inch dick .
 9 inches around .
 yes that is the general consensus but it manages to be bad in so many surprising ways that it &apos;s funny .
 i want to read the rest of this in the same way i want to see the aftermath of the car that caught on fire on the highway 
 yup ,  the twins were invented with their magic and i &apos;m sure they picked that up from their father .
 he loved putting magical enchantments on muggle stuff ,  which he made sure there was a loophole in the law for him to do ,  and kept it hidden .
 hell ,  he had an invisible flying car he created .
 do not go on please
 for some reason or another ,  my mother hated me .
 as a little girl i could never understand why she treated me so much worse than my 3 other siblings ,  and i would often go up to my grandmother and ask her  &apos;why doesn &apos;t my momma love me ?
  &apos; she never could give me a straight answer and would tell me  &apos;your momma loves you in the only way she knows how .
 that answer confused me because she loved my siblings just fine (disclaimer: her love was toxic af ,  and she did a different type of damage to my other siblings .
 now when i say that my mother treated me badly ,  it started out with her picking fights with me .
 she would constantly nitpick at everything i  did ,  chastising me ,  and at the end of the day punishing me harshly for something that could have been a gentle scolding .
 when i got older ,  she started cussing at me ,  and calling me names .
 she would often ignore me for days on end ,  and when she would talk to me it would be to make me the butt end of a bad joke ,  or to tell me she hated me .
 yes ,  my mother looked me dead in my eyes and told me she hated me (disclaimer #2: she was a drug addict and alcoholic ,  and she loves to claim all the emotional abuse she put me though as a child was the effects of the drugs ,  and it  &apos;wasn &apos;t even that bad &apos;) .
 it was things like that that really began to tear at me after awhile .
 all sorts of terrible things she did to me growing up ,  the terrible things she said ,  and how she ignored me constantly .
 all of it very different than how she treated my other three siblings .
 she was very close with one of my brothers and my sister .
 she would spend time with them constantly ,  take them anywhere ,  buy them anything that they wanted and it made me resent them .
 my sister would sometimes rub it in my face that  &apos;mom loved her more &apos; .
 it was her way of having power over me ,  and it was one of the things that made my rage bubble over on innocent people .
 i just wanted to be loved and accepted ,  i wanted to be cared for and cherished as a child should be ,  and when i didn &apos;t get that ,  i plotted on how i was going to get her love and affection .
 in my screwed up mind ,  i thought that if i got rid of my older brother and younger sister .
 i would be one of the only people left for her to love .
 i planned on killing my brother .
 how screwed up is that ?
 it wasn &apos;t just some thought that passed through my head; it was a constant idea ,  a plan that i was putting into place to end his life so that i could make room in my mother &apos;s heart for me .
 i feel ashamed writing it out .
 it was a dark time in my life ,  and i was also incredibly mentally ill .
 my brother was addicted to pain medications ,  and my parents were trying desperately to get him clean at the time .
 ironically ,  at the same time he was going on a drug induced rampage ,  my sister had shattered her leg on a trampoline .
 she was on some pretty heavy pain pills ,  and while my mother was doing everything in her power to keep my brother away from the drugs ,  she would leave my sister (and her drugs) in my care .
 so one day ,  while my mother was out dealing with my brother and my sister was sleeping ,  i took the rest of her pills (my sister was super afraid of becoming addicted to drugs after watching what my mother and brother were going through ,  so there was a ton left) and i waited for my brother to come back .
 when i heard him come through his window (his room was next to mine) i went into the kitchen and made him a glass of juice .
 earlier in the day i had crushed up the pills into a powder ,  and i mixed them into the juice .
 i went up to his room ,  knocked on the door ,  and offered him the cocktail of various prescription drugs .
 he took the juice ,  and right before he was about to drink it i had  thought .
  &apos;how could i do this to my own brother ?
 i snatched the drink back ,  and it spilled all over the carpet .
 he was high and super pissed ,  but at least he was alive .
 i never tried anything like that again .
 it felt so sick ,  wrong ,  evil .
 i mean ,  what type of person thinks about killing their brother ?
  besides ,  my brother dying wouldn &apos;t make my mother love me any more ,  she would have just resented me for living instead of him .
 so thats &apos; the sad ,  sick story of how i almost executed my brother .
 i didn &apos;t actually carry through with it ,  obviously ,  and i guess everyone lived happily ever after .
 my brother got clean and now has a happy family ,  i &apos;m in college ,  my sisters leg healed up nicely ,  and my mom left us after awhile .
 (but thats &apos; a story for another time) .
 i have two sisters .
 one older ,  and one younger .
 my mom worked hard to make sure each of us felt special and loved .
 he called my older sister princess and my little sister was referred to as little buddy .
 for whatever reason ,  i got kind of forgotten about .
 i didn &apos;t mind most of the time .
 i found my dad annoying ,  demanding ,  and at times unreasonable .
 i hated the way he bullied my mom and would lash out about things that didn &apos;t make sense .
 basically ,  i thought of my dad at a total brat .
 he &apos;d have a bad day at work ,  and would find someone to take it out on .
 usually ,  my mom and i .
 but i still tried .
 i &apos;d try to cuddle up with him ,  feeling hurt when he &apos;d shrug me off and tell me i need to shower .
 i made gifts for him .
 got good grades ,  won poetry contests .
 won awards through bible quiz .
 but it never seemed to work .
 before long ,  he &apos;d find something to yell at me about .
 things that usually didn &apos;t make sense .
 if my little sister and i fought ,  the whole thing was my fault .
 my feet turn in .
 i hated when my dad would come to my sporting events ,  because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him .
 one time i was running from one base to another ,  feeling exhilaration because i &apos;d done it .
 i &apos;d hit a home run .
 the smile died on my face when i heard my dad yell ,   &apos;run with your feet straight !
 you look stupid !
 as a teen ,  my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone .
 he was never physically abusive ,  but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you .
 when i was 15 ,  he was almost successful .
 i went through a couple of really bad months .
 a friend died ,  my dog died ,  we moved ,  and my mental health was tanking .
 a week after my friend died (car accident) ,  my dad asked ,   &apos;so when are you going to get over it ?
  &apos; it took me by surprise ,  because at that time ,  i wasn &apos;t crying or acting out .
 i was just sitting there ,  eating dinner with the family .
 my mom immediately reacted ,  gasping out a surprised ,   &apos;john !
  &apos; and the two of them began fighting again ,  over my dad &apos;s need to mess with me .
 i sat there ,  head down on the table ,  thinking ,  i &apos;m not allowed to be sad .
 i &apos;m not allowed to feel happy .
 i can &apos;t get mad .
 i &apos;m in pain ,  and he finds it annoying .
 just leave me alone ,  dad .
 leave me alone .
 that &apos;s when it clicked: my dad ,  for whatever reason ,  seemed to hate me .
 i could try to make him like me ,  but it wasn &apos;t going to work .
 as i got older ,  my goal became to avoid him ,  his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully .
 we were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship .
 that &apos;s when it clicked: it &apos;s not me ,  it &apos;s him .
 my sisters could like and love him ,  but i didn &apos;t need to respect him .
 i was done trying to please him ,  trying to do the right things ,  trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want .
 fast forward almost ten years later .
 after the birth of my son ,  my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me ,  because for whatever reason ,  he latched on to my kid .
 for the sake of my kid ,  i let my dad have a relationship with him ,  but i was always monitoring ,  waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him .
 there was no way i was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me .
 fortunately ,  my dad died before the change could happen .
 i sat in the back at his funeral ,  dry eyed and satisfied .
 of course my sisters were upset .
 they had good relationships .
 but for me and my mom ,  it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead .
 no more stress .
 no more unreasonable expectations .
 the egg shells we &apos;d been walking on were swept away ,  and we could be content .
 i have an uncle in west virginia that i started to see as my father-figure .
 at first ,  i jokingly would call him dad ,  testing the waters ,  waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids ,  and doesn &apos;t need an adopted daughter .
 i go see him once a year .
 but i always felt like maybe ,  he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying .
 a couple of weeks ago ,  i asked him if he was coming up for christmas .
 he said he couldn &apos;t .
 but then he said ,   &apos;i love you ,  my daughter .
 sorry this was so long .
 i guess i needed to get that out .
 finally decided to fight back against abusive parents .
 only had to do it once to stop the physical abuse ,  the brain fucks kept happening .
 i didn &apos;t grow up with the best family .
 there was a long period of time where there was constant fighting ,  and things often went too far .
 i didn &apos;t feel safe in many different ways .
 it all culminated to a point when i was 17 ,  disowned ,  and about to get kicked out .
 but ,  my vindictive ,  defensive actions in the past made my mother know that kicking me out wasn &apos;t a good idea .
 i know the only reason i could have a roof over my head was becuase my mom isn &apos;t a citizen ,  and she knews i would have reported her for the crime of child abuse (which did happen) which would have put her residency in jeopardy .
 so ,  i guess i had to threaten to burn the village in order to feel the warmth of safety .
 a lot of people are assuming my mother is illegal ,  but she &apos;s not .
 i &apos;m not exactly sure the mechanism through which she can stay in the united states ,  but she married my dad (american) and they got divorced .
 she can live and work here but she doesn &apos;t have the full protection of the government like me .
 when i was a teenager living in rural alabama ,  i did nooooot get along with my stepmother .
 she went out of her way to be as mean as she could to me .
 once when she left the house ,  she took the mouse for the family computer with her so i couldn &apos;t use it while she was gone .
 i did her one better by taking a cord from the back ,  then locking myself in my bedroom until she got home .
 she uses my little baby stepsister against me and tells her to tell me she has a present for me .
 as soon as i unlocked the door ,  stepmother yanks it out of my hand and starts screaming at me about why the computer won &apos;t work .
 well ,  let me tell you ,  on both sides of me i had a steel pole lying against the wall and a simple glass of water .
 i briefly entertained the notion of smashing her in the face with the pole .
 and instead just chucked the harmless water in her face .
 i &apos;m quite sure i avoided jail that night .
 i had a coworker at a non-commission based retail job where a coworker would repeatedly sabotage my sales so she could get a lot of credit apps and a high gsp (avg hr sales) .
 she would overhear my pitch for cards (required) and then lie to the customer so they would apply .
 i would have to try and rectify what she said while she hovered over me .
 she did many other questionable things ,  and i reported her multiple times ,  as did my coworkers (and customers) .
 now ,  one time i got lucky and an 18 yo kid came in yo buy the most expensive desktop we have on display .
 she saw me do this sale ,  but i needed a manager to approve a tiny discount ,  but my radio was dead .
 coworker was watching me the entire time ,  so i asked if she &apos;d call for the mgr .
 she stone cold ignores me .
 i go for the mgr ,  she prints out paperwork on the computer and tries to sell it to him .
 when i return ,  she literally yells at me in front of the customer to give her the sale bc she worked too .
 i ignored her & didn &apos;t give her the sale .
 when i reported this (as did the customer ,  he was mortified) ,  i was literally told by my boss  &apos;ignore when she does that .
 she &apos;s a middle child ,  so she does stuff like that &apos;  .
 i was tired of the stupid lack of action ,  so i filed an hr complaint regarding her .
 and five of my managers for not addressing it .
 they all got reamed for it .
 only one is still in a management position ,  the rest were eventually demoted or laid off .
 i used to work in fast food ,  and was the only person in the store that didn &apos;t smoke .
 everyone else got to take a break to smoke ,  but since i didn &apos;t smoke ,   i wasn &apos;t allowed to .
 eventually ,  i spoke to the owner about it and was rebuffed ,  so i went over their heads to the company board .
 owner got his ass chewed out for rebuffing me and i wound up getting a huge bonus my next paycheck ,  but when they discovered i reported them ,  i got fired immediately .
 turns out they &apos;d been violating company policy in food prep and storage ,  so i filed another report to corporate .
 store got shutdown for months and my former boss got fined 6 figures .
 my brother is ten years younger than me and is a teenager .
 i regularly drive him around to see his girlfriend and to his classes .
 recently he’s becoming very disrespectful and downright rude .
 he’s only nice to me if i’ve made food or if he needs a ride and in a way that pisses me off even more .
 the amount of times i have seriously considered pulling over and making him walk the last 10 miles home .
 my dad didn &apos;t seem to take any interest in my life since i was four ,  then when my mum left him and i told him i was going to leave he then proceeded to do everything to get me to live with him (buying me stuff ,  telling me mum isn &apos;t a fit parent ,  trying to get custody in court) .
 i decided to live with him because i was too scared to start a new school mid way through the year .
 he then dates this woman who was pretty much the catalyst in destroying their marriage and gets mad at me when i don &apos;t treat her like a mother .
 mum is now trying to get custody and i would burn his house to the ground if it meant she would win .
 wife was a  &apos;senior staff &apos; for a local science fiction convention .
 not only was she an unpaid volunteer ,  she had to take a vacation day off work and pay for her hotel room and parking .
  on the morning that the convention started ,  she was setting up the first of the three rooms she was responsible for -- manual labor ,  moving tables ,  setting up shelves and loading them with stuff -- and somebody came in ,  took her id badge off her desk ,  and brought it to the convention &apos;s lost-and-found .
  convention l-f lady told wife that lost badges have a $5 fee to get them back .
  wife looked at the badge ,  looked at her ,  and said  &apos;keep it .
 i &apos;m going home .
 have a nice convention .
 wife was about 25 feet down the hall when l-f lady caught up to her and returned her badge .
 oh man ,  middle school for me .
 i was heavy bullied at school ,  mentally and physically .
 i wasn &apos;t getting any support at home or felt like i was .
 i was not in a good place then ,  i had so many negative thoughts of hurting others and myself .
 thankfully i never had a gun or i would have become one of those school shooters ,  that how bad and deep in depression i was in .
 i did in up in a psych ward and man those places are terrible .
 i didn &apos;t get any help but only learn to bottle my shit up more .
 i can absolutely attest to being around people who were love-starved and then subsequently self-sabotaging or otherwise destructive .
 in a softer sense ,  if i have felt rejected i have felt peace in sort of burning bridges to find myself .
 moved to a new town ,  and started going to a new church when dad got cancer .
 went to church and told the pastor to try and get advice .
 pastor announced this to the convocation ,  and also told everyone that some lady &apos;s horse was sick .
 watched the entire convocation console this lady about her sick horse .
 the convocation was in tears about some sick horse while my dad was dying .
 no one said a word to my family .
 never been to church since .
 whenever i’m in a meeting and my suggestions are getting consistently ignored and i’m getting interrupted and talked over ,  i get the weirdest urge to prove i still exist by jumping on the table and busting out the queen of the night aria .
 there’s a lot of good advice in the replies !
 i will say that in about 60% of my meetings this is never an issue ,  and in the other 40% it’s an issue because of a few specific coworkers who resort to just yelling if confronted politely .
 their managers have been made aware of this .
 when i had been bullied constantly in seventh grade by three different kids/groups of kids and the school showed so little interest in helping me .
 i was physically bullied ,  verbally mocked ,  humiliated in front of the other kids ,  and not an eye was batted .
 when i finally took my mom &apos;s advice to make a scene the next time someone started throwing things at me ,  i did it .
 we were outside that day for p .
 and while we were all sitting in lines at the start of class a kid in the line next to me started throwing pebbles at me .
 i ignored it for a moment ,  then when he kept going i yelled at him to stop .
 i didn &apos;t care that people were staring ,  i wanted them to .
 i wanted them to see that this average-height ,  able-bodied boy was throwing things at me ,  a very small and disabled girl .
 the teacher came over and asked what happened .
 kid told him they were only pebbles ,  he wasn &apos;t hurting me .
 the teacher agreed with him and told me if i ever disrupted his class like that again i was getting detention .
 i don &apos;t know what it is about some teachers but the second they get put in charge of more than one child they become absolutely blind to any kind of bullying ,  and if it gets pointed out to them ,  they think that particular incident exists in a vacuum and couldn &apos;t possibly be a sign of anything worse .
 i was 11 years old and suicidal because i felt so incredibly powerless .
 that teacher only solidified that feeling .
 when i was a kid my dad used to beat on me pretty often .
 when he was sober i usually did something to  &apos;deserve &apos; it .
 when he wasn &apos;t it was just go time .
 one night (i was 14) he got drunk and when i got home from a girlfriend &apos;s place he cornered me and put a revolver to my head .
 he told me how worthless i was and that he would be doing me a favor by killing me .
 i didn &apos;t respond .
 i just waited for him to pull the trigger .
 he left my room and left the revolver on my dresser as he walked out .
 i took the revolver and went out .
 i walked around my hometown ,  sat by the river and thought about all the ways i could get back at him for all the misery he caused my mother ,  sister ,  and i .
 i also considered doing the ol &apos; kurt cobain but that &apos;s not relevant .
 i took the weapon apart and threw it &apos;s pieces in the river .
 no one &apos;s asked me about the gun since .
 it &apos;s probably still there .
 holy shit ,  that blew up .
 thanks for all the upvotes and awards ,  everyone !
 dumped at the doorstep of a youth shelter after my mum was hospitalized and dad was in prison .
 i wasn &apos;t a super bright teenager ,  but had enough sense to spend my last $20 on pepper spray and padlocks for my stuff .
 predictably ,  people &apos;s stuff went  &apos;missing &apos; all the time .
 i could write an essay on the issues in the public welfare system ,  ranging from the macro level (lack of funding) to the micro level (incompetent or burnt out staff) .
 there was violence ,  substance use ,  and sexual assault in crisis accommodation ,  but what bothers me ten years later is the sheer stupidity of some adults who are meant to guide at-risk teenagers .
 i would ask my social worker questions like ,  are there places which can help me with food this week ?
 how do i write a resume ?
 and that social worker would vaguely shrug and offer relaxation techniques and mindfulness strategies .
 look ,  three people got arrested at this shelter last week ,  no amount of  &apos;relaxation techniques &apos; are going to calm me down .
 i &apos;m guilty of doing stupid and irresponsible things as a teenager ,  but eventually finished high school and then 3 university degrees .
 i actually work for the same system that i was and am disappointed in ,  and there are so many practical resources available .
 they &apos;re underutilized because staff don &apos;t even know they &apos;re out there .
 if i had just a single adult to help me with the most simple tasks as a kid ,  it would have been so much easier .
 when you &apos;re a kid you just don &apos;t know how university loan applications ,  taxes ,  budgeting ,  etc works .
 or at least i didn &apos;t .
 and everybody assumes that you do ,  because they do .
 like i had no idea that in my country ,  the department of housing can pay for your rental bond .
 i stayed in a homeless shelter for an extra 1-2 months to save up $900 to pay for the bond of a shitty apartment .
 extra months of broken sleep ,  men trying to pick the lock to my door ,  residents hyped up on ice .
 last year there was a 16 year old girl on the train ,  having a meltdown and making a public scene .
 she was clearly drunk and people were avoiding her .
 she started screaming that she missed her period and does anybody want to pay for her termination .
 she phrased it as a joke or a way to get money (which i did not give) .
 but i guess she repeated it enough that i wondered if it was true .
 we got to talking and i referred her to a social service ,  downloaded a list of resources in her catchment area ,  and saved links and forms on her phone about how to arrange her own healthcare cards since she &apos;s over 15 ,  so that she can visit a bulk-billing gp on her own and get tested .
 in my country ,  the pee test from a pharmacy is about $15 but a pregnancy blood test ordered by your gp is free .
 we discussed different options that her gp might outline and other things that might be helpful .
 i know as well as anyone else that it &apos;s not always that straight-forward - especially with 30 patients in your caseload and juggling them with a million other priorities .
 but in the biopsychosocial framework of health - where biological ,  psychological ,  and social factors are proposed to impact physical and mental health - we severely underestimate the impact of social circumstances .
 we let these kids down all the time ,  and it &apos;s preventable .
 bullied in middle and high school ,  relentlessly ,  and occasionally violently .
 administration turned their backs on me when i needed help ,  but was always there to come down on me like a ton of bricks when i made the smallest mistake .
 became a loner ,  went from a straight a student to failing nearly every class .
  i felt betrayed and abandoned by everyone i trusted to help me at that school .
 the undiagnosed mental illness didn &apos;t help things either .
 if i had access to weapons back then ,  i probably would have been a statistic .
 luckily this was twenty years ago and i &apos;ve gotten help through counseling and medication .
  a lot of people quit when i did .
  they &apos;ll survive ,  but the atmosphere isn &apos;t nearly as light anymore because all the fun people left except one ,  and now the turnover rate is ridiculously high .
 working in public accounting as an auditor .
 65+ hour weeks ,  getting yelled at by clients for things that aren &apos;t your fault ,  getting chewed out by your manager for being over/under budgeted hours for a client ,  staying in hotels 5 days a week during busy season ,  eating poorly because you never had time to cook .
 let &apos;s just say one of the best days of my life was when i got laid off from that place ,  which opened the door for a great opportunity with none of the issues listed above .
 grew up with an incredibly privileged but emotionally abusive family ,  i never really fit in .
 they would frequently gaslight me with so much but one that made me feel like i was going crazy was that they all hated each other but would act like i was the only one to fight with anyone else and band together in that .
 i’ve moved out now but there were many nights when i felt like i was going crazy and that i could burn that house down and not look back .
 glad i didn’t though ,  always a better way out .
 wow ,  not a huge redditor ,  first comment i’ve had with any real engagement .
 its nice to hear there’s other people who’ve dealt with the same stuff and still surviving as well ,  nice to know peeps aren’t alone in it .
 stay strong ,  happy living !
 probably my relationship with my dad .
 my stepcunt was always ,  well ,  a cunt and i finally got the courage to tell him how i couldn’t stand her and she was rude to me when he wasn’t around and i didn’t want to go to his house anymore for fear of the bullying from her and her kids .
 he told me she want leaving and i needed to get over it .
 we didn’t talk much for 13 years .
 fast forward to today and she has the audacity to tell people she has granddaughters (my kids) but for the sake of my mending relationship with my dad i don’t go and set her straight (and tell her to fuck off) .
 god i hate that woman .
 here in australia ,  the fire starts itself .
 therapy is a magical thing where you learn to burn down anything that is bad for you .
 and then you take it to your family .
 my family seems to be somewhat accepting of me buring down the stupidity that is hurting us all ,  and leaving the nice things ,  tho .
 the church/group of churches/pseudo-cult i grew up in was very much this way .
 didn’t go to the right school ?
 didn’t send your kids to the bible summer camp ?
 your kid/spouse/family member “sinned” in a public way ?
 not a married 20-something with 3 kids and actively a “leader” ?
 took me twenty years to see through the bullshit ,  and another seven to finally truly feel free .
 i’d burn all that shit to the ground for the hell they put every person through .
 for those asking ,  i grew up in the churches of christ ,  a fundamentalist group mostly in the southeastern us .
 very untwined history with mormonism though - we actually influenced them a bit .
 look up sidney rigdon and alexander campbell if you want the cliff notes .
 the time i was working at a psychiatric hospital and the ceo assumed i smoked drugs because i had dreadlocks .
  i worked hard for those patients and they trusted me .
  i shielded the hospital from nearly weekly riots of patients .
  after being unfairly judged and made to look dispensable ,  i almost set the inmates lose on the asylum .
  but then ,  i realized that it was selfish and those people i cared so much about would be punished for fighting my fight for me and basically would be the firewood for my fire .
 i was raised in a cult .
 there were 11 kids ,  with four moms ,  and the leader had really convinced our moms that he was the archangel michael .
 i tried to run away over and over in my late teenage years ,  hiking across the desert in the dark to get to the highway ,  where i would try to hitch a ride .
 every single time ,  well-intentioned truckers called the police to report a little girl walking along the highway with her thumb out .
 i am short ,  and i had been malnourished my entire childhood ,  so even after i turned 18 ,  i was underdeveloped and couldn &apos;t convince anyone i was an adult .
 michael always called me in as a runaway and the cops would take me back .
 the last time ,  i was 20 ,  and i felt so hopeless when i saw the police lights ,  i thought very seriously about trying to attack the officer with my knife (that i always brought in case i was picked up by a crazy person .
 ) i knew i was too small and weak to actually hurt the officer ,  but he would be obliged to arrest me and send me to jail .
 it was the only way out i could think of .
 the theatre department at my college ,  despite building their entire persona on empathy ,  was the judgiest ,  cliqueiest ,  least empathetic group of people i &apos;ve ever known .
 if you weren &apos;t part of the in-crowd you weren &apos;t given the same support .
 there were many of us that existed on the outskirts ,  working so hard just to see the same few people get all the opportunities ,  even as far as being cast in lead roles after they graduated .
 as i struggled with depression ,  anxiety ,  and undiagnosed adhd ,  i worked tirelessly to keep up with my peers only to be told i needed to apply myself more .
 i saw people put in half the work some of us did and end up with higher grades .
 one professor actually gave arbitrary grades to the 4+hours of homework he assigned based on page counts and who he thought  &apos;deserved a higher grade &apos; .
 i tried so hard to get no support in return that i became incredibly suicidal and had to take a semester off to deal with my mental health .
 it only took two more years and another medical break before i finally was able to graduate .
 when i was like 15 i got in a fight with my friend over something stupid .
 i went home and was shaking with rage .
 full on puberty meltdown anger .
 i was stomping up and down the hallway breathing through my teeth all hard .
 at one point i went in the kitchen and got a knife and started talking to god like  &apos;forgive me for what i do to him !
 lol fuckin nimrod ,  im embarrassed when i think about that
 dig in for a different kind of story than most in this thread .
 it &apos;s not about me ,  it &apos;s about someone i used to know .
 growing up ,  i was part of a huge diverse friend group .
 people from different schools ,  different small towns .
 all walks of life .
 something i feel really fortunate for .
 one of these guys ,  let &apos;s call him big bob ,  was part of our group for years and years .
 he came from a tough family ,  never had any money ,  but honestly ,  he brought the  &apos;energy &apos; to the party .
 one of those guys .
 always talking ,  bombastic ,  good with jokes and memes and references .
 so collectively ,  those of us who had the means found a way to help him along since we did enjoy his company .
 and this worked for years .
 we &apos;d drive him home ,  help sneak him into the movie theater ,  share food and alcohol  with him .
 as he got older ,  he started to develop sticky fingers .
 at first it was candy bars at the cash register .
 then it was a odd piece of clothing from a store he &apos;d stuff down his shorts .
 then it was portable harddrives in the best buy bathroom .
 eventually he got caught by the law ,  which seemed to stifle things .
 but then he moved to doing things where the law wouldn &apos;t catch up to him .
 you &apos;d find games wouldn &apos;t be returned in a timely manner .
 then eventually we found out he had sold an old xbox & games that someone had  &apos;loaned &apos; him after they bought the new xbox 360 .
 we wanted to have a big lan party and wanted another system .
 and that &apos;s how we found out that he had sold it for petty cash .
 he never told anybody .
 little things would just go missing .
 again ,  and again ,  and again .
 eventually ,  i went off to college and he didn &apos;t .
 but those who also didn &apos;t go to college you would still hear stories from .
 eventually it reached a boiling point and one of the friends in the group confronted big bob ,  one who had been stolen from .
 bob denied it all to his face .
 and we ostracized him .
 i know he was in that place .
 he had a bit of a temper ,  and i &apos;ve seen him lose it before and smash his phone on the concrete .
 i know for a fact he felt like burning the house down after that confrontation night .
 nothing actually ever happened ,  but growing up with him for 10 years i &apos;m sure it was a whirlwind that night .
 but at the end of the day .
 it was deserved .
 we tried to make him part of the village .
 or at least i hope i did .
 i grew up in a dysfunctional family ,  though feeling very loved cause i was the youngest .
 i’m from a culture where you’re not supposed to be gay .
 so i always knew that i was loved for the wrong reason and that the moment i’d come out ,  everybody would hate me to the core .
 the facade i kept up with lasted into my mid 20s and then one day ,  i just exploded and updated my social media ,  coming out .
 my family hasn’t spoken to me since then .
 it’s been 6 years .
 i guess the fire is still burning !
 thank you all for your kind words .
 it means a lot .
 i know a lot of you are concerned ,  but i have found my own family .
 i have a best friend who’s there for me from when i wake up til when i go to bed and vice versa .
 had she been a guy ,  we’d probably be married by now  .
 i also feel that i need to clear something up .
 one of my brothers still speaks to me .
  i get to speak to his children and he has changed my view from how i used to look at him .
 growing up ,  he had a mental illness and in my family ,  we never believed in that either .
 and i feel terrible because remembering when i was a young teenager all the way until i turned 20 ,  i used to be angry at him saying that i didn’t believe in his “attention seeking” .
 it was taking a toll on the family and i was mad at him for a long time .
 i’ve said stuff that i’ll probably have to live with for the rest of my life .
 whereas when i came out ,  he’s the only who didn’t stop talking to me .
 the “crazy” (the way mentally ill people are viewed in the culture) family member is the only one who was there for me .
 i never mentioned that in my original post and i feel like it’s something that should be mentioned .
 and today ,  i’d put him above everyone else in my family ,  no matter if they’d come around or not .
 around after i came out ,  he got into one of his episodes and nobody cared to talk him into getting to the hospital to start his meds again .
 i was on phone with him from the other side of the world for three days until i convinced him to get into the hospital where they helped him .
 i like to think that he forgives me for the things i used to say nowadays because i’m doing everything to make him know that i feel like there’s absolutely nothing wrong with his mental illness .
 edit 2: okay ,  i just got my first ever silver .
 thank you whoever it was !
 my parents were horrible abusive drug addicts ,  they were known in the town and i was always treated like i was using meth myself as a kid .
 people tried to get me removed from classes because i would be a bad influence .
 teachers made fun of me or kicked me out of class for things like “playing in the rain and coming in all wet” when they knew damn well my homeless ass walked to school .
 but one thing really stuck out .
 they day my my parents died (they died a day apart) but it blurred into one ,  a cop pulls me over .
 homeless and have no support .
 he tells me i did nothing wrong and hands me a seatbelt ticket for $90 and says “don’t turn out like your parents” in a really shitty tone .
 my blood boiled and i just wanted out of that town but i was broke .
 well i stuck to education .
 got my emt ,  got my fire science degree and i got my spot on the local fire department .
 i didn’t think much of my past but one day i had a car accident i went to and it wasn’t bad but the car was overturned and the guy in it was freaked out (rightfully so) and when i get down to let him know helps there ,  you know who it is ?
 and i would never refuse care ,  i wouldn’t imagine doing so to anyone ,  and it never crossed my mind ,  but i swear that dude thought i was gonna leave him to die .
 he started looking like i was death .
 but instead of the burning down of the village ,  i helped him and he was really proud of what i became .
 i explained to him what he had done to me ,  and he knew .
 but i think talking to me and getting my point of view was eye opening .
 anyways ,  i still think it’s funny the dude thought i was gonna kill him over a ticket .
 i (f20) spent several months in a mental institution .
 i was a young teen when i was first admitted .
 the staff were extremely abusive to most patients ,  although certain ones were spared due to their meek behavior .
 one time ,  i was tricked into admitting to an infraction that i had never committed ,  and i was forced to stay in my room for several days on end .
 i attempted to file a complaint ,  but it never really went anywhere .
 the staff were typically very unkind ,  and they treated each patient as though they were a burden .
 i was very lonely ,  and i sank even deeper into depression .
 i kept my head down for several months until i was eventually released .
 as an adult ,  those months in the ward still haunt me .
 i struggle with feeling worthwhile ,  and i criticize myself for the smallest things because the hospital conditioned me into nitpicking and punishing myself for not being perfect .
 i have picked up the phone numerous times ,  trying to work up the courage to call the head of the hospital and give him a piece of my mind ,  but i’ve never been able to go through with it .
 when i was in 7th grade my parents got divorced .
 my anger and sadness continued to grow .
 one thursday night my father picked up my siblings for the obligatory meal out .
 i declined to go .
 i went into my room and started fucking around with my chemistry set .
 picture this setting; a farmhouse built in 1830 ,  burlap walls in my bedroom ,  hundreds and hundreds of comic books ,  and wall to wall carpeting .
 your standard tinderbox .
 instead of using a bunson burner for my heat source get this .
 i used an empty plastic margarine container .
 and instead of practicing any other safety protocol ,  i set the fuel on the carpet and lit it .
 surprise ,  the plastic melted almost immediately and the fuel soaked the carpet .
 before i  &apos;knew &apos; what happened flames were licking the walls and furniture .
  at this point i had the good sense to yell  &apos;fire &apos; to my mother who was blissfully unawares in the kitchen .
 she dialed 911 ,  while the child genius ran in and out of the inferno trying to save his marvel &apos;s and d .
 thankfully the emergency services got there quickly and were able to contain the damage to my bedroom .
 it was completely blackened .
  for years i believed the whole thing was a terrible accident .
 only as an older adult can i admit to one simple fact: my pain and need to be seen ,  manifested in the torching of my own room .
 am in the process of starting a “fire” now .
 my negligent and narcissistic mother has pushed me over the edge .
 in this latest episode ,  she came into town in october .
 i took two extra days off from work (and it’s not easy to recover from being away from my job) and i dropped about $400 over the long weekend on food/entertainment .
 come to find out she’s been badmouthing me to my sister and aunt about how i didn’t let her stay longer even though my mom never even directly asked to stay longer .
 she called me on the phone to tell me i made her cry .
 this ,  from a woman that didn’t brush my hair growing up .
 i actually have a story for this .
 so i was a senior that was friends with 4 juniors in a friend group .
 i wasn &apos;t exactly part of their group ,  but they seemed to enjoy my company .
 i was both the funny friend and the therapist friend .
 i helped them through their prom fiasco when they were at odds with each other .
 i made them food on occasion .
 at my graduation ,  they all said that we should get together as a group and do something fun and bonding before i left for college .
 one of them even says that she would plan a party for us all .
 a month passes by ,  i invite them all to see a movie .
 one by one ,  they flake during the week before the movie .
 i end up going to see it alone .
 another month passes ,  and they &apos;ve maintained radio silence .
 over the next few months ,  i try to invite them to various events ,  and without fail ,  none of them end up being available .
 i ask them about doing something together ,  and no dice .
 all the while ,  i watch their instagram posts of going to a lake and having a lake party ,  or having a new years eve party together .
 now ,  here i am ,  typing this out on reddit before going to bed and waking up tomorrow to go out of state for college .
 that &apos;s a badass proverb of i do say so myself .
 working in corporate
  &apos;if i can not inspire love ,  i will cause fear .
 i &apos;ve never done this in real life .
 but definitely in video games from time to time .
 when i told my mom i was being sexually abused the first words out of her mouth was “ nobody wants to touch you” .
 life in public accounting
 in grade school all of my classmates were either hostile ,  judgemental ,  uncaring ,  manipulative ,  or some combination of them .
 the teachers didn &apos;t even help ,  and some of them even tried to bully me into thinking i was stupid .
 i tried talking to older and younger classes sometimes ,  but that would only cause more bullying .
 my parents didn &apos;t help me either ,  their only advice was uselessly preaching about obedience and waiting .
 it &apos;s far in the past and doesn &apos;t really affect me anymore ,  but if i ever bear or adopt kids i &apos;ll try to give them the guidance which i received way too late .
 i always feel like a loser in school ,  i have friends but end up alone 95% of the time .
 my family doesn’t know that i’ve hit it big in my industry (the industry they said that you’d need superhuman talent or a lot of luck to make it in) .
 i’m getting my finances and the logistics in order ,  and next week i’m moving out unexpectedly .
 the guys i’ve hired to move what few possessions i’m taking with me arrive some time in the morning and my flight leaves in the afternoon .
 i’ll leave a letter explaining that i haven’t harmed myself but they are not likely to see me for a long time .
 i’ve got my own phone on my own plan ,  a plane ticket ,  and a place lined up on the other side of the country .
 my family won’t take it well since they thrive on control and conflict and i expect the whole family to implode from finger pointing and drama whoring once i’m gone .
 i suppose i started the fire ,  actually .
 i was the only kid in my family to go to college .
 i &apos;m from ireland ,  so it wasn &apos;t a financial decision ,  i was just the only one who worked hard enough in school to have any chance .
 in my final two years of school i was studying every day ,  even during summer and winter holidays ,  from day 1 .
 my other two siblings were at best ,  showing up for school ,  except one of them rarely did ,  and the other showed up high most of the time .
 this was basically the way it went for my entire life ,  and during that time my parents had focused their attention on the  &apos;problem children &apos; ,  completely ignoring my needs wants or achievements .
 i was left alone to do my homework ,  or expected to help siblings with homework ,  even though one of them was older than me and was tackling coursework i hadn &apos;t even encountered yet .
 they weren &apos;t abusive parents ,  just bad ones - if my brother or sister got straight c &apos;s ,  we &apos;d go out to dinner to celebrate .
 i scored in the top 5% for math scores in the country twice in a row ,  the second time i didn &apos;t even get a congratulations .
 so along comes college ,  and with it exposure to new ideas .
 i come out as trans to my parents ,  which they ignore like most things i say .
 one sibling goes to work in hotels ,  and eventually around the world on charitourism ,  working to save turtles and teach kids english .
 the other eventually moves out of home ,  gets a job in a hotel he hates ,  and barely ever calls .
 i &apos;m stuck at home (it &apos;s not common to move out in ireland if you don &apos;t have to during college) ,  and not able to work due to the high workload in college and the long commute (4 hours a day) .
 siblings end up back and forth of our family home ,  and we start to fight a lot .
 i &apos;m not working ,  so i don &apos;t understand the real world (bare in mind i &apos;d work 40 hours a week during the summer vacation) .
 i &apos;m not doing well in college anymore ,  so it &apos;s assumed i &apos;m slacking off (i &apos;m still in therapy and on medication for depression brought on by stress and neglect) .
 i eventually go to the united states ,  where i meet my now wife for the first time .
 we spend a glorious couple of months together before i have to travel home because yet again ,  i &apos;ve failed college .
 i had one class to make up ,  so i put my future on hold and return to ireland ,  safe in the knowledge that at least my sister is still in china .
 except she surprises the whole family by coming home for good three days after i get back .
 to cut an already long story short ,  i finish college ,  and am a week away from flying back to my now fiance .
 we &apos;re watching a science documentary together on the television .
 my sister is starts explaining something about it wrong to the youngest sibling (i now have 3 ,  but they &apos;re much younger) .
 i correct her ,  and she tells me i &apos;m wrong .
 when i tell her i literally have a science degree ,  the entire reason i &apos;m home at all ,  she tells me i didn &apos;t  &apos;really &apos; graduate college because i didn &apos;t have to take another exam (i was allowed to make up my grade) .
 i curse her out for being an awful bitch who talks down to everyone at every available opportunity ,  who hasn &apos;t held a real job for 3 years and barely limped her out of high school .
 i yell at my dad for enabling her shit for so many years ,  allowing her to walk over family members because she &apos;s loud .
 my mother asks me what &apos;s wrong ,  and i tell her she &apos;s raised a hateful ,  spiteful daughter .
 i spend the next week at a friends house before travelling home and packing up my things to load onto the airplane .
 the night before ,  my mother tells me she &apos;ll get up in the morning to wish my goodbye and goodluck as i start my new life in america .
 the fire isn &apos;t really that warm .
 my side “hobby” is dog rescue .
 my facebook feed is filled with code red animals that are about to be euthanized ,  with news reports of animal abuser after animal abuser after animal abuser; sexual assault of animals ,  starving them ,  beating them ,  dog fighting ,  some with quite graphic photos .
 if i respected life less and had martial skills .
 but fortunately i am not them .
 and i refuse to become them .
 instead i will do what i can to heal the mess they leave behind .
 going to the dmv
 it is a great quote ,  but not an african proverb .
 the origin of the quote is from this passage “if the fires that innately burn inside youths are not intentionally and lovingly added to the hearth of community ,  they will burn down the structures of culture ,  just to feel the warmth .
  &apos; - poet michael meade ( men and the water of life ,  1993) not an african proverb .
 my aunt was killed by a drunk driver in 2013 .
 we took in her 3 youngest kids .
 a set of twins ,  9 months younger than me and her 6 year old .
 i’m an only child .
 we went from a family of 3 to a family of 6 over night and man it was hell .
 not only were we all grieving but my parents quite literally didn’t care about me or how i felt ,  for good reason ,  now that i’m older i understand better but at 16 i didn’t understand at all !
 i had always been my parents #1 priority ,  why were they worrying about her kids before me ?
 i was severely depressed and honestly worse off mentally than her kids ever were .
 i didn’t get help .
 i didn’t get therapy .
 i didn’t even go to the madd meetings that my parents and the other kids went to because they never told me about them .
  my feelings were suddenly invalid and i just wanted to die .
 so ,  there i was ,  stuck between a rock and a hard place ,  i didn’t want to make the situation worse by killing myself ,  but i also didn’t want to be alive any more .
 i told my mom one night “sometimes i think about taking all of my sleeping pills and going to bed and not waking up” which was met with “shut up nickname .
  i built up such a resentment towards my mom because she never helped me .
 she was my mom .
 i needed my mom and she wasn’t there for me .
 6 years later i can forgive it ,  but i’ll never forget how low i felt .
 i just needed my mom and she wasn’t there for me .
 can &apos;t seem to catch a break .
 feeling  &apos;up to here &apos; with everything .
 experienced some debilitating sickness .
 that pain ,  combined with mental pain ,  rage ,  and anguish from loss in three short months .
 led to me attempting to bust out an unbreakable window .
 fractured my elbow .
 alone in the er .
 haven &apos;t eaten solid food in weeks .
 losing my patience ,  lost all my energy .
 sending kind notes to strangers on the internet is the only thing keeping me going .
 please don &apos;t shed a tear .
 i just need to vent .
 my parents  &apos;kicked me out &apos; to teach me a lesson after finding out i was bi .
 almost killed myself so they would understand what i was feeling in that moment .
 a possible fire was reported at my apartment and i just happened to be leaving when the fire department showed up .
  i was stopped at the red light directly in front of my door as two fire trucks approached ,  one behind me and one in front .
  the truck in front of me pointed to the sidewalk so i pulled up tight to the building across the street from my front door to give them room ,  tight up against a telephone pole in front of me ,  and both trucks pulled up beside me blocking me in .
  i watched from the drivers seat as the firemen raised a ladder to the roof and began putting their equipment on .
  i hopped out and asked one of them if this was serious because i had a pet in my unit .
  he assured me this was a routine call as there was no visible smoke nor flames coming from anywhere .
 i let out a sigh of relief and returned to wait by my car with my girlfriend and two of her friends .
  a few minute later the front door of my apartment opened and 3 firemen emerged .
  the back door to my unit was nailed shut when i moved in ,  with the doorknob removed .
  we had placed a light bookshelf in front of it facing my tv .
  for these men to exit my apartment from within could only mean they had kicked that door down ,  which they did .
  it also meant both doors were now wide open and my 6 month old kitten could escape .
 i ran into the building to find my living room in shambles ,  my bookshelf destroyed having shattered my tv in the process of toppling over ,  and my kitten nowhere in sight .
  after a few minutes of flipping furniture and checking every nook and cranny i was distraught and left the apartment to start searching the surrounding area .
  i lived on commonwealth ave .
 in boston at the time in a busy neighborhood with people ,  cars ,  trains etc .
  this was no place for a kitten .
 my girlfriend ,  her fiends and i split up to searched the area ,  but after 20 minutes there was no sight of my little kitten .
  with my girlfriend in tears ,  her friends heads hanging low ,  we retreated back to my car to collect ourselves ,  and that’s when the village turned its coldest shoulder to me .
  “can you believe that !
 ” i heard from the window next to my car .
  i looked up to see my neighbor pointing at the parking ticket on my windshield .
  i had been given a ticket well over $100 for parking in the sidewalk ,  which i was instructed to do by the very firemen who had just destroyed my apartment and lost my pet .
 i took my jacket off ,  picked up the ticket ,  and stormed across the street towards 2 policemen who were standing in front of my building .
  as i approached them i yelled “which one of you did this !
  taken aback the policemen pointed to the “emt” badge on his shirt and explained that he was indeed not a policeman .
  even more enraged by my stupidity i turned to find an actual policeman to yell at ,  when i noticed a pack of 4 or 5 cops all standing together in the street .
  blinded by my rage i yelled “i’m going to knock a fucking cop out !
 ” as i stomped towards them .
 that’s when a wise old villager decided to save me with a last minute embrace .
  i felt a hand slap the back of my neck ,  squeezing hard ,  and spinning me around in the other direction .
  another hand ripped the ticket out of mine and a voice said “just shut the fuck up walk with me .
 ”  he was a police officer in his 50’s and he just asked me what happened .
  i explained and he ripped the ticket in half and said to forget about it ,  that someone had screwed up .
  he told me to take a breath and calm down .
 and to never do that again .
  he was right about that .
  in hindsight it was a very dumb and immature thing for me to say and do ,  and i in fact was not going to knock out any cops because all of them were significantly bigger than i was and had weapons .
 when all the drama died down and the cops and firemen departed ,  i parked my car legally and returned to my apartment to assess the damage with my girlfriend .
  as we began picking up the rubble we heard a rustle and squeak from under our bed .
  in a panic my kitten had decided to climb into a purse inside a duffle bag to hide from the firemen ,  a hiding spot so small and cozy that he decided to stay and take a nap the entire time we were searching for him .
  the relief of still having him almost made up for the destroyed living room and the ass i had made of myself while barking at cops .
 i’m glad things ended the way they did .
  i was more than prepared to try to burn the village down that day ,  however i sincerely doubt i was prepared to even manage a spark before the village put me in county lockup for the night .
 at this time now .
 my desire to leave my country and renounce my citizenship gets stronger day by day because of all the shit i see in my government down to the people .
 i had a severe dissociative episode with amnesia when i was 35 .
 i remember things before the event ,  but everything else from the week it lasted is either missing or jumbled .
 i woke up in a mental hospital .
 my father ,  who has always been extremely distant ,  came and said he was going to be there to help take care of me .
 he said he researched ptsd and talked to some people who had it .
 he had never been there for me before ,  even though it was something i desperately wanted .
 when i was released ,  he stayed in town two days before saying that he missed his life at home and abruptly leaving .
 i had waited my entire life for my father to give a shit about me ,  and the best he could muster was 2 days of awkward small talk .
 i’m marrying my fiancée in february 2020 ,  and i’ve decided that my children and i will take her last name .
 her father is a kind ,  caring person .
 he has three daughters ,  and no sons to carry on his name ,  but because he’s been a better father to me in the past four years than my father was in four decades ,  i feel like he deserves to have his name continue .
 i &apos;m already late to this party but .
 there was a point in life where i thought it was going to be my duty to take some shit down .
 people ,  places and things .
 and myself thereafter of course .
 saw the world as a very dark place .
 and in that same period of time ,  i found myself rescuing a needy/abandoned puppy .
 which led me to learn just how beautiful things can be with just a little help .
 again help ,  not hurt .
 the person who thought that died some time ago .
 the pup ,  although now a senior dog ,  is still alive and well .
 and i &apos;ve moved on to provide some really good opportunities for some very disenfranchised folks .
 and i have a chance happening to credit for it .
 it was always burning since the worlds been turning
 whenever i go camping or to a bon fire party without a total fire ban .
 complete apathy during most of my elementary years
 i have been abused by my mother from as long as i remember until i was able to leave when my parrents divorced at 16 .
 one day when i was 15 or 14  ,  i had enough ,  i had planned to kill my mother in her sleep .
 i knew i would have had a lesser sentence because i was under 16 and abused .
 i had taken the knife and waited until everyone was asleep .
 when it was probably time ,  a thought hit me .
  &apos;what if i miss and she doesn &apos;t die  ?
 she would argue i &apos;m unstable and no abuse had ever happened .
 she would also probably kill me if i missed .
 i knew she was capable of it &apos; .
 strangely ,  the thought of getting killed by her was more upsetting than suicide because at least i would be in control of my life .
 anyways ,  i haven &apos;t seen her in 6 years and i plan on continuing that way while rebuilding myself .
 i was heating up bread .
 for one minute .
 fifty second too long .
 almost my entire adult life .
 with spaces in between .
 i &apos;ve been self-immolating for 20 years .
 in middle school ,  i had a teacher who taught my favorite class ,  geography .
 i had maps in my room ,  i could recite all the countries and some capitals ,  and tell you a little bit about a lot of them .
 i was a starry ,  bright-eyed student looking to learn more and she ,  well ,  she was a bore .
 she was sexist ,  rude ,  dry ,  and took zero interest in teaching .
 she would dismiss my questions in class ,  give us stupid assignments ,  and test us on topics we didn &apos;t learn in class .
 to make a long story short ,  she was no longer working at the school at the end of the year thanks to me .
 i posted about this in another thread before ,  but when i was fourteen ,  i was diagnosed with non-hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma ,  and had to do a year and a half  of chemotherapy .
  i was about halfway through freshman year (ninth grade) of high school .
  it was really hard because it was a super intensive regimen-i was basically always in the hospital .
  the longest i was ever home was two weeks; usually i would only get to be home for one week ,  with low white blood cells ,  then go back to the hospital for the next drug as soon as i recovered enough .
 i lost all my hair repeatedly; it never grew more than a couple centimeters .
 my face was all swollen like a balloon .
 i was incredibly pale .
 i developed a bunch of stretch marks from taking chemo that made me nauseated and unable to eat and losing fifteen pounds ,  and then gaining the same fifteen pounds back when they put me on prednisone for two weeks and i had insatiable hunger .
 i ended up wheelchair bound because i didn &apos;t have the strength nor the dexterity to walk long distances (i had really bad drop foot--the muscles in the front of my foot are weaker ,  so it &apos;s harder for me to pick up the front of my foot when i walk ,  so i tend to trip and stumble a lot--it &apos;s way better now ,  i couldn &apos;t walk before) .
 so i get held back a year .
  when i come back as a junior (eleventh grade) ,  i don &apos;t have any friends .
  i literally do not know a single person in any of my classes .
  i had to bring a form to my pe teachers that said that i was physically disabled and i couldn &apos;t run and i certainly couldn &apos;t do the dancing part .
 my teacher tries to make me run a mile every week .
  the popular boys sit in the bleachers every week and yell at me that i &apos;m a dyke ,  just run thunder thighs ,  etc .
 i should mention that the entire time i was going through chemotherapy ,  there was radio silence from my school .
  no one cared at all .
  i didn &apos;t even get a get-well card from any of my teachers .
 so this popular boy who &apos;s on the football team has a brain tumor and he just has surgery and that &apos;s the extent of his cancer treatment .
  the school held a fucking assembly for everyone to go to in support of him !
 everyone has to wear purple that day ,  because it &apos;s his favorite color !
 and then there &apos;s me ,  cancer survivor ,  regularly made fun of for my appearance due to being a cancer survivor ,  who got told fuck-all by anyone in the school just two years ago .
 i &apos;m sure most people who read this could imagine the rage i felt at the time lol .
 within a few months as a teenager i was arrested for selling drugs ,  went to jail and was put on probation .
 all the while my parents were having a nasty divorce and being kicked out of school(not for drugs)
 my dad &apos;s side of the family .
 after my mom divorced my dad when i was 7 ,  i &apos;d spend every other weekend at his house (like many divorce kids do) ,  but i never felt really close to his family .
  my aunt was a ratchet bitch in her own right ,  ruined god knows how many family events (including my wedding ,  the bitch) ,  and she was the kindest because she was the only one that acknowledged my existence .
  once he passed ,  the shit .
  all of a sudden my half sister (she and i had the same dad ,  diff moms) was convinced that dad had money ,  and that i was screwing her out of it .
  even after the probate judge reviewed all the paperwork and gave it a rubber stamp ,  she and his side of the family were convinced i was robbing them blind .
   i guess i didn &apos;t answer the question correctly ,  because as soon as his estate was closed ,  i cut those limbs off my family tree ,  doused them with gasoline ,  and tossed a match with glee .
 i see pictures from their annual family reunion every year on facebook ,  and i say fuck  &apos;em .
 my last year in the navy .
 i stopped working and basically did the absolute lowest possible minimum ,  the most microscopic step above doing absolutely nothing !
 i left early to lunch and came back late as shit .
 some days i showed up to morning muster late on purpose .
 i was a second class (e-5 ,  equivalent to a sergeant in the marines/army) ,  the only thing i gave a shit about was training my juniors .
 i tried to give as much training as i could before i left .
 i didn &apos;t notify my watch coordinator that they took me off the watch bill so i didn &apos;t stand a single watch in a year and a half .
 deployment was fantastic without a watch !
 my chain of command didn &apos;t give a flying fuck if i went the extra mile because the shop was being run smoothly ,  no overdue jobs ,  we were all qualified ,  and a very tight team .
 they sure as fuck noticed when i stopped giving a shit !
 they took away my supervisor responsibilities and gave them to another second who was lower in rank to me by time in grade and i basically became an overpaid e-3 .
 as if that was any kind of punishment .
 i was doing even less work .
 i had to sweep floors and clean the machines lol .
 i &apos;m not proud of the way my career ended .
 i admit i could &apos;ve been much more mature about it but i was in a really bad place mentally .
 i &apos;m not an innocent victim ,  but i &apos;m not the bad guy either .
 we lose a lot of good people in the military simply due to horrible toxic leadership !
 in my whole shop ,  only 2 people reenlisted out of 12 .
 wouldn &apos;t give me my stapler .
 said i was gonna do it .
 it &apos;s my stapler .
 i think this applies ?
  my family rejected me so then my closest friends become my family .
 you know like  &apos;friends are the family you choose &apos; .
  and now my  &apos;family &apos; is surprised they &apos;re not included in my future plans at all and i prioritize them less during holidays .
 this is like a novel .
 i did burn down the village and i &apos;m not so proud of that part of my life .
 but it was middle school so  .
 imagine going to school with the same people from grade 1-8 .
 6th grade: i was a regular kid ,  sure i took some special ed classes and had a crush on one of the marginally more popular guys .
 well one of my  &apos;friends &apos; told others who i liked and it escalated to a point where the entire grade knew ,  and kids are cruel .
 i got teased from the minute i stepped in the door till when i left by the popular kids .
 this went on for months .
 7th grade: i was still dealing with the blowback from the previous year ,  but they decided to add on my special ed classes to that teasing making sure i knew i was not as smart as everyone else .
 then a nerdy kid (nicest kid in the world) had a crush on me and he was teased about it and i was as well .
 i have a vivid memory of two kids talking in some other language about me and another kid they were pointing and then someone asked what they said in english ,  they replied with  &apos;he &apos;s kinda smart but not really ,  she &apos;s stupid and slow &apos;  .
 8th grade: things died down ,  but i was making new friends and some old ones didn &apos;t like the new ones so they completely cut me out of their lives .
 towards the end of the year things blew up and everything in the past came back at full force ,  them bringing up things from elementary school and past years in middle school .
 see ,  i was that quiet kid that sat there ,  watched and listened to other people &apos;s conversations .
 i was a fly on the wall ,  since i wasn &apos;t significant and didn &apos;t talk much they felt like they could talk around me .
 i knew a ton of things i probably shouldn &apos;t have known .
 i wrote notes to people confessing love to different kids for others ,  over exaggerating everything .
 i got kids in trouble with teachers .
 i made sure the people that betrayed me and hurt me got hurt back but in a way that wouldn &apos;t come back to bite me once i left .
 after all that happened i left and went to a technical high school where i wouldn &apos;t have to go to school with the same people again .
 i heard some stories of the fallout of what i did ,  i ruined some lives (temporarily) i hurt a lot of people ,  and lost a lot of friends .
 i don &apos;t regret burning any of those bridges ,  but the way i acted back then is what i regret .
 this did teach me some important life lessons .
 be sure who you keep around you is not just there to use you .
 don &apos;t let others kick you while you &apos;re down ,  stand up for yourself .
 don &apos;t accept abusive people into your life .
 when people act ugly ,  they &apos;re showing their true colors ,  believe it .
 and the most important thing .
 accept who you are and love yourself because there will always be terrible people trying to cut you down ,  there &apos;s no point in helping them .
 throwaway account (sorry) .
 apologies in advance for the length; there is a tl;dr at the end .
 i &apos;ll admit ,  i &apos;m a little scared to make this post ,  but the quote has struck a chord with me ,  so here goes nothing .
 that time in my life is right now .
 explaining my  &apos;home &apos; situation would take far too long ,  but trust me when i say it is toxic .
 \- i am 21 years old ,  and live at  &apos;home &apos; with my  &apos;mother &apos; ,  older sister (23) ,  and youngest sister (14) .
 \- my  &apos;father &apos; and my younger sibling (17) live in an apartment across town .
 \- my  &apos;mother &apos; and  &apos;father &apos; have hated each other since before i was born ,  and are currently in the middle of a very messy divorce (in my opinion ,  they shouldn &apos;t have gotten married in the first place) .
 \- both my  &apos;parents &apos; have spent my entire life manipulating me and my siblings into siding with them in their little war ,  actively bribing or blackmailing us into saying negative things about the other  &apos;parent &apos; .
 \- my older sister (23) is emotionally manipulative and will not hesitate to throw others under the bus to save herself (more on that later) .
 \- my younger sibling (17) was psychically abusive towards all of us when they still lived with us (and reportedly sexually assaulted our  &apos;mother &apos; ,  but i cannot attest to that) ,  made fake suicide claims whenever they didn &apos;t get what they wanted .
 \- my youngest sister (14) is actually suicidal ,  but our  &apos;mother &apos; refuses to believe her because of all the fake suicide claims we had to go through .
 \- my  &apos;mother &apos; is a hoarder with poor spending habits; habits she blames on her children (seriously ,  toddler-me learned to walk through crowded hallways and buried floors ,  but the mess is somehow my fault) .
 \- my  &apos;mother &apos; uses our pets as a way to manipulate us into doing what she wants; she &apos;s never directly threatened violence towards the animals ,  but she has implied as much ,  and she will not hesitate to guilt us into doing what she wants by claiming that our animals are  &apos;suffering &apos; or  &apos;dying &apos; because of us .
 like i said ,  explaining everything would take far too long ,  but this should at least be a start .
 recently ,  an online friend offered me a way out .
 this friend was willing to let me move in with her and her family 1 , 300 miles away from here .
 we made plans for the move .
 i went to great lengths to keep my  &apos;mother &apos; from finding out .
 i did ,  however ,  tell my sisters .
 i didn &apos;t want to hurt them .
 about a month ago ,  a week before i had planned to leave ,  everything hit the fan .
 we had a family argument .
 my older sister had done something stupid that nearly injured an animal ,  and we were all understandably upset with her .
 then ,  out of nowhere ,  she threw out a red herring .
  &apos;what does it matter when (ta1420) is leaving on the 10(th) ?
 my older sister ,  to avoid being criticized for her own reckless actions ,  threw me under the bus .
 suffice to say ,  i am still in the house .
 my  &apos;mother &apos; convinced me to stay ,  just for a month or two longer .
 getting into everything that &apos;s happened in the past month would be a mess .
 a few tidbits (again): .
 \- repeated accusations that i am leaving my animals to die .
 \- repeated accusations that i am in contact with my  &apos;father &apos; and am somehow helping him to undermine her in the divorce .
 \- telling me that i &apos;m the reason my younger sibling is the way they are ,  and saying that i &apos;m a  &apos;bad influence &apos; on my youngest sister .
 \- screaming that she needs me to clean up the house so she doesn &apos;t lose it in the divorce ,  only to turn right and say that i contribute nothing and should just leave since all i do is make things worse .
 \- telling me that ,  if she catches me trying to leave ,  she &apos;ll strangle me (there have been incidents involving choking ,  not full-on strangulation ,  but i still take the threat seriously) ,  only to turn right around and tell me to get out of her life .
 i cannot trust that she will not try to hurt me if i try to leave .
 i cannot trust that she will not hurt my animals in retaliation if i get out without her noticing .
 my older sister is becoming increasingly hostile towards me fro wanting to  &apos;abandon &apos; her .
 i am terrified that my younger sister will spiral once i &apos;m gone ,  however it is that i end up leaving .
 i am strongly tempted to burn this house to the ground with everyone in it .
 i &apos;m not just saying that for the quote ,  either; the thought has been in my head for some time now .
 after all ,  with all the junk in here ,  it wouldn &apos;t be that hard to block all the exits .
 my friend still wants to help me ,  but ,  now .
 i &apos;m scared to hurt her .
 i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s my  &apos;mother &apos;s &apos; words ,  or mine ,  but i can &apos;t stop thinking about what a horrible person i am .
 i destroy everything i touch .
 i hurt everyone i love .
 i am becoming exactly like her .
 we are ,  all of us ,  hopelessly broken people ,  and it feels like the entire world would be better off without us in it .
 it &apos;s a fire that i &apos;m afraid to start ,  but one that &apos;s been a long time coming .
 tl;dr: i had planned to sneak out of/run away from a toxic family situation .
 i didn &apos;t want my  &apos;mother &apos; knowing ,  because i knew she would stop me ,  but i did tell my sisters (i didn &apos;t want to hurt them) .
 my older sister then told our  &apos;mother &apos; what i was planning to save herself from criticism .
 my  &apos;mother &apos; convinced me to stay a while longer ,  and my life has been hell since .
 leaving has become very dangerous ,  and i feel trapped .
 i have reached a point where it feels like it would be better to just burn everyone and everything to the ground ,  if not just to spare everyone else the trouble .
 tldr: the mental health system in the us is completely f-ed .
 one day when i was 19 ,  i was at work and suddenly a police officer was there to arrest me; he took me in cuffs to a local hospital psych ward .
 the doctor immediately told me to take this cocktail of drugs ,  that i could take them voluntarily or they &apos;d get a court order to take them .
 i had no idea what was happening and complied .
 the drugs put me in some kinda comatose state where i felt loopy and had a hard time following anything ,  much less complicated court proceedings .
 i learned someone filed some paperwork against me ,  and they could hold me 72 hours ,  but since a weekend was in there it was really 5 days before i went to court to find out what the f was going on .
 the doctor never interviewed me ,  he went off what was in report and prescribed based on that .
 5 days of unnecessary cocktail drugs ,  and being a naive 19 yrs old ,  idk what was happening nor what things meant in court .
 i was placed on a 6 month commitment and shipped off to some group home to live and be monitored .
 the doctor would change his diagnosis every 6 months ,  from one condition to another that made no sense ,  and anyone suffering from these afflictions would never have .
 but that &apos;s how the us system works ,  the doctor &apos;s theory is the gold standard no one questions .
 6 months was extended to a year ,  a year to two and then eventually 3 years .
 when i was finally released i tucked my tail and ran ,  i didn &apos;t complain or risk any way of getting sucked back into their system .
 turned out that my very strict catholic parents filed a report that i was a danger to myself or others because at 19 i had rejected them and was rebellious entertaining satanism .
 they told me they  &apos;gave me to god when i was born &apos; and since i had rejected him i had to be very sick .
 obviously they lied to ppl under their belief they were doing the right thing .
 i lost my job ,  my car ,  my apartment ,  all my belongings ,  and 3 years of my life .
 i had never committed any crimes nor shown any signs of violence ,  yet i was imprisoned for 3 years .
 and now ,  20 years later the affects of being force fed a cocktail of unnecessary drugs has had longterm side effects on my health and body .
 yay thanks mom and dad .
 i did start the fire but it almost hurt people i loved .
 so i put it out .
 i just never regretted starting it .
 the day my son was born ,  right there at the hospital  my girl dumped me for the rich saudi arabian neighbor of ours .
 lord knows how long they humpin .
 pretty sad but i have my son out the deal .
 they are still a couple 12 years later my son is grown lil man that i raised 1 day a week visits and or online skype .
 had the gas ,  had the matches .
 my sons smile made me put it down ,  stay humble and try enjoy life .
 i became a loner ,  video game playing loser  .
 well i am a pretty good player actually .
 but a loser in life pretty much .
 been 12 years and never had another girfriend till recently dated for 1 month then she said i have to be jehovas witness if i want to be her boyfriend .
 i wish to make this year a change  !
 please wish me good positive energy so i can have the strenth to be more willing to engage with life .
 wanted to add that i was/am  a padi certified scubadiver before i met my sons mother and then  i stopped .
 i will try start that hobbie this summer instead of video games .
 i &apos;ve never told anyone this but when my brothers and i(f) had to spend the weekend with our father we would usually end up in this old rod and gun club .
 dad would just sit and drink and we would have free range of everything .
 well ,  one day i got my period really heavy and i didn &apos;t have any tampon or pad on me and of course the gun club didn &apos;t have any .
 i begged him to take me home ,  take me to get tampons or pads ,  that my underwear and skirt had blood on them .
 but no ,  he was watching the game and he was drinking he can &apos;t drive now .
 wait till later .
 i was soo frustrated .
 i went back to the truck and sat in the back for awhile .
 i thought of a great revenge plan .
 i would take out my tampon and hide it somewhere .
 it wouldn &apos;t take long to start to smell .
 plus he leaves for work a week at a time .
 the whole truck would smell like rotted blood by the time he finds the tampon .
 i never did because he would have hit me .
 i regret not doing it .
 he is a asshole
 had a group of friends that were extremely toxic and bullied me often .
 one in particular knew i had feelings for him (before discovering that he was horrible) .
 he used this to take advantage of me and was really verbally abusive .
 his friends often followed him in abusing me and one threatened violence against me when i wasn’t in the room .
 i really wanted to punch all of them in the face ,  but one of them was a martial arts champion and the others were bigger and stronger than me .
 instead i made a series of paintings to cope with the emotional damage and recently gave a speech about it .
 some light tragedy in a broken home ,  what i &apos;ll call  &apos;no-touch abuse &apos; .
 i wasn &apos;t struck ,  i wasn &apos;t sexually abused ,  but a lot of other bad stuff so i never felt like i could be myself (had to be different people for different people) ,  i had no control ,  there was no joy or hope in my life .
 except my friends and adult siblings who tried to keep me sane .
 i was on some national merit scholar type radars ,  and i felt like i wouldn &apos;t be able to lie properly to the investigators without googling their process ,  which would be recorded .
 if only we &apos;d had tor to go with that netzero ,  i &apos;d probably be a murderer .
 i eventually aged out and found happiness and success ,  so don &apos;t worry about me .
 side note: i was born in hawaii but the family moved on before i went to kindergarten .
 still ,  when you &apos;re in hawaii i &apos;m told you &apos;re kind of everyone &apos;s baby .
 they ask to pick up the baby ,  pass around the baby ,  coo and smile at the baby ,  and that seemed to affect me deeply in a good way .
 the village embraced me .
 i &apos;d say that applies extremely well to school shootings in the united states
 i rage quit my church .
 i was an intern at a pentecostal church in a small town .
 a student reported that another intern was verbally abusing him and his friend and they wanted to stop attending youth group .
 it was near constant put downs from someone who was supposed to be their mentor and leadership figure .
 the fellow intern was 20 they were 16/15 .
 when i brought this up to the pastor it went over like a wet fart .
 really couldn’t have given a two shits and defended the other intern .
 those two kids came from very rough backgrounds and the needed the stability they we’re getting at that church .
 swing it smacked away because my fellow intern was popular and could play the guitar was the last straw .
 i booked and told them to shove it .
 from what i understand it caused a lot of issues .
 i was beat and tortured everyday for the first 16 years of my life .
 i &apos;d never actually do it but i often think about murdering my entire family so i can sleep easier at night .
 for now though they continue to exist ,  there &apos;s no justice ,  i continue to suffer with a messed up body and mental health because of them and i &apos;m constantly having nightmares and flashback about what happend .
 also this world in general hasn &apos;t been kind to me at all .
 i &apos;m so tired of life but my anxiety makes me overthink the concept of death so i don &apos;t kill myself .
 but yeah life as a mentally ill person is awful and sometimes i think about starting a fire against this shit capitalistic world as well that &apos;ll do anything to make money even at the cost of everyone &apos;s lives .
 also the same system doesn &apos;t give a shit about anyone that strugglings so if you &apos;re disabled like me good fucking luck .
 that is an incredible story .
 thank you for your bravery in writing it out ,  i think if more people hear others going through stuff like this and what came of it ,  they won’t feel so alone ,  and it helps .
 but very few ever speak of it for fear of repercussions .
 i guess that’s what makes the anonymity of reddit so wonderful .
 more about your mother .
 just curious what happens to people like that .
 it &apos;s really unfortunate that you grew up with so much pain .
 it can cause us to do crazy things .
 but don &apos;t forget .
 spilling the drink on the floor was your choice and i &apos;m proud that you did the right thing .
 thank you for sharing your story .
  &apos;i love you ,  my daughter .
  &apos; oh my goddddd that &apos;s the sweetest ending to this fucked up story .
 of all the sad stories here ,  this is the one i relate to most .
 first ,  the horror of your father yelling disapprovingly as you ran the bases .
 it seems like my father believed that saying anything positive about me would ruin me somehow .
 i was 16 when ,  not knowing i was within earshot ,  he said to mom that i had done a good job morning the lawn .
 that simple compliment made me burst into tears -- because it was the first time i ever heard him compliment me .
 he is long dead and i am my late 60 &apos;s -- but still at the grocery store when the credit card reader says  &apos;approved &apos; -- i &apos;ll mutter to myself  &apos;approved - like my father never did .
  &apos; wearing a twisted smile .
 second ,  your emotional reaction to your father &apos;s death .
 when my dad died ,  i thought that something was wrong with me because i wasn &apos;t sad .
 i mostly felt relieved .
 a year later my wonderful mother died and i cried buckets .
 i decided the problem was dad ,  not me .
 it seems you figured that out quickly; good for you .
 i am glad you have a loving relationship with your uncle .
 if you are not married and hope to get married someday -- when you are dating pay attention to your potential father-in-law .
 my fil was a wonderful father figure for me ,  helped heal the old hurt .
 many times ,  child abusers just have one target .
 it &apos;s not an all inclusive sort of disease .
 i &apos;m glad you found a father figure who is happy to have the role .
 it &apos;s so terrible when the people that are supposed to protect you are your abusers .
 i &apos;m so sorry you &apos;ve had to live through this .
 for me ,  it was 6 months ago .
 finally decided to fight back against bullying i’ve endured from “friends” for years .
 i’m alone but damn i’m stronger and better for it .
 grew up being physically abused by both dad and mom .
 the last time my fuckin dad raised his hand on me was on my 18th birthday in front of all my friends .
 haven’t talked to him since .
 literally had the worst childhood growing up and i suffer from serious ptsd from all the years of abuse .
 to the point where i have refused to have any children of my own .
 so repulsed by the idea of parenthood and children .
 funny how abusers tend to be cowards .
 they like their targets soft .
 i feel you ,  i grew up with an abusive father who would beat my mother ,  sister and me until when i was around 15 ,  i was playing football and had been lifting weights i finally decided to stand up to him one day when he was about to hit me .
 from that day on he never laid a hand on me .
 i ended up leaving my senior year and moved in with a friend and once i graduated i joined the us navy and the rest is history .
 i haven &apos;t spoken to my father in over 10yrs and i feel i &apos;ve finally broken free from all that evil .
 threaten to burn the village in order to feel the warmth of safety .
 i hope you have a good day
 out of curiosity ,  what ethnicity ?
 i &apos;m asian ,  and i have a couple asian friends in similar situations (though not the citizenship part) .
 so ,  is she still a massive bitch ?
 i &apos;m a middle child and i &apos;m offended
 on behalf of middle children everywhere ,  i am a healthy amount of dramatically offended by this generalization .
 don’t blame us for that grown toddler !
 this sounds like every sales job at best buy .
 there’s always a “managers favorite” (typically a cute girl) who gets away with everything .
 when i managed a pizza place 20 years ago i used to give non-smokers a coke break to go drink a soda .
 it never seemed fair to me that the smokers would go fuck off for 10-20 minutes while everyone else worked .
 plus ,  they always wanted to go smoke as soon as rush was over and it was time to clean .
 pro-revenge material right here
 you shouldn &apos;t drive him around .
 just don &apos;t drive him around if he &apos;s disrespectful .
 lol just don’t drive him
 just go and live with her .
 refuse to go back .
 your dad will have to go through the system to get you back .
 true ,  the cops might take you back to him once or maybe even twice but ultimately if you are stubborn enough the cops will refuse to do your fathers bidding and tell him to take it to court .
 trust me on this .
 just go to your mum now .
 how old are you and are you in the us ?
 when my parents got divorced and filed for custody i as the child had a representative appointed for my interest .
 they asked me who i wanted to live with and i think the older you are or the more well reasoned your answer the more likely the court will consider your wishes in the eventual outcome .
 you can explain that you’ve been estranged or not close with your father but chose to stay with him because you were afraid of the abrupt change of switching schools ,  but now you’ve realized you’d rather have the stability of your relationship with your mother than the stability of the same school .
 it was like they were trying to burn down their own village at that point .
 i &apos;m not sure if it &apos;s legal to take things to the lost-and-found and charge for them to be returned .
 $5 fee to get them back .
 you literally have the badge right there .
 didn &apos;t have to make a new one ,  there was no extra work or trouble caused by it .
 a memeber of the public returned it .
 hope she walked away still .
 surely it must have been clear to her what the convention was all about .
 imo ,  once something like that happens ,  you don &apos;t come back even if they  &apos;fix &apos; the issue .
 seems like a scam that was done on purpose and didn &apos;t expect to not pay up .
 in the volunteer organization i work with ,  we are specifically trained never to threaten or disparage a volunteer ,  only invite them into a position of less responsibly if we absolutely must .
 because of this exact reason--they &apos;re unpaid and can walk away at any time ,  we have very little real leverage .
 do you think you &apos;ll recover and be happy ?
 may the bridges you burn light the way forward .
 its hard not to burn bridges when you got that motivational fire beneath your feet .
 oh ,  that &apos;s awful .
 i &apos;m from the uk ,  so many of us are not brought up in any religion .
 but ,  my friend was starting to go to our local church and she just received news that her bosses new baby (a few days old) had unexpectedly died .
 totally distraught ,  she went to church and had a word with the vicar asking could the baby be mentioned in the  &apos;please pray for &apos; section of the service .
 she was appalled when the first question asked  &apos;was the baby christian ?
  &apos; as if any other baby would not be worth mentioning in the service (when a clearly upset parishioner needed the support of the church at that time) she never went again .
 sounds familiar to me .
 one of the reasons i stopped going years ago .
 no true compassion for anyone unless it makes them look good socially .
 i &apos;m sorry about your dad .
 i know there are no words ,  but i am sorry .
 bring an airhorn .
 then just continue talking as if nothing interrupted you .
 (i cannot guarantee the success of this strategy .
 i &apos;ve seen people who do so in a respectful manner ,  and it works .
 sometimes it &apos;s just an overeager person trying to get their thoughts out that cuts you off ,  and they may not mean it .
 chiming in to let them know you weren &apos;t done is helpful to both of you .
 and if the person that cut you off did mean it ,  you &apos;re showing them you won &apos;t be a doormat .
 in situations like that i usually raise my voice and say something like  &apos;as i was saying before i was interupted .
  &apos; it usually shuts up people and keeps them from interupting again .
 my mum had that in the 70s ,  every time she brought something up in a meeting it was dismissed ,  then when a man  brought it up it was discussed .
 ministry of defence !
 she used to quote the old joke “that’s a good point miss smith ,  now would a man like to bring the subject up so we can discuss it further”
 throw pebbles at the teacher .
 they wont hurt ,  they &apos;re only pebbles .
 and that is why i tried to take a bat to school .
 to bust some knee caps .
 thankfully my mom caught me and realized how bad it was and got me out .
 but not before bringing down hell on those teachers .
 (she made even the principle freak out) .
 despite how angry i was ,  for some reason ,  i never thought about using my dads &apos; guns and i &apos;ll always be thankful for that .
 deep down i think it was because i really didn &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
 i just wanted them to leave me alone .
 the bat was also one that was covered in foam so really i was a dumb kid .
 it breaks my heart that you had to go through that .
 i was in similar situation at that age .
 i was the girl that had to get eye surgeries and kids had a literal and figurative field day with it .
 how are you now ?
 the way my teachers were  &apos;blind &apos; to bullying was by gaslighting ,   &apos;oh ,  they actually like you !
 that &apos;s why you &apos;re being treated this way !
  &apos; like ,  are you fucking kidding me ?
 i mean ,  this was the 90s ,  but now a statement like that would get a crusade for that teacher to be fired and that school a civil suit .
 my parents -well ,  more my mom because my dad was always on business trips- took my treatment seriously .
 i couldn &apos;t imagine what it was like for my mom to see me come home every day crying .
  when my dad was home ,  he told me if anyone ever touched me ,  i needed to punch ,  kick ,  scream at them ,  but most of all ,  defend myself .
 unfortunately ,  i had no idea after this conversation that one of the groups that bullied me were planning on beating me up .
 the day it happened ,  i was on the playground with one of my friends bouncing a ball back and forth .
 all of a sudden ,  i heard what sounded like yelling behind me ,  but i thought nothing of it until i saw this shock register on my friend &apos;s face .
 the yelling got closer and by the time i realized ,  it was too late .
 it was three kids wrestling and they fell on top of me .
 all of a sudden ,  their combined weight is crushing me and i &apos;m being punched ,  kicked ,  and having my face drilled into the pavement .
 my screaming drew the attention of the recess aid ,  yet the three kids somehow just kind of walked off .
 i was escorted to the nurse &apos;s office and she called my mom .
 i remember that i wasn &apos;t sent back to class and i was sent home early .
 my backpack was brought by my teacher .
 once i saw myself ,  i had two black eyes ,  my cheeks were yellow from bruising ,  scraped ,  and so were my elbows .
 i never saw my mom so angry .
 my parents spoke to the school themselves and told them ,   &apos;three kids just don &apos;t  &apos;fall on top of &apos; another kid and look like our daughter does .
  &apos; whatever else my parents said to the principal and other administration must have gotten through because not one teacher the whole time i was in that school ever treated me like my complaints didn &apos;t matter .
 as far as those kids go ,  nobody was ever really punished because it happened so fast that i didn &apos;t get a solid look at them .
 as i said before ,  our situations in the present day wouldn &apos;t go without some kind of ramifications on the school &apos;s end .
 i hate even using the term  &apos;sue happy &apos; ,  although when both teachers and administration don &apos;t take a stand to adequately and effectively protect students ,  the fault rests totally on their incompetency .
 when i was about 15-16 years old ,  i got on a bus for a band trip and the seat was a bit wonky .
 i hate making a scene so i just put up with it instead of finding a new seat .
 then the two fuckwads who bullied me throughout the year sat behind me .
 about halfway through our trip ,  the bus hits a small pothole and there &apos;s a distinctive crack from my seat .
 the assholes behind me notice and immediately start up with  &apos;hey mycurrentcage !
 did your fat ass break the seat ?
 i tried to ignore it .
 i tried to ignore it for the past 9 years of my life ,  but they wouldn &apos;t stop .
 the teacher was talking ,  i couldn &apos;t get his attention .
 i tried so hard to ignore it ,  but they wouldn &apos;t shut up .
 i don &apos;t remember what i said ,  but i exploded on them .
 i screamed at them ,  crying .
 the teacher (who knew me well) looked at us ,  two normal guys who had past behavior issues ,  and a crying girl who never got in trouble and was always volunteering to help out ,  and he started to lecture me for my outburst .
 for  &apos;distracting the driver .
 all three of us got detention when i finally choked out that it was their fault .
 fuckwads showed up to detention ,  signed in ,  and walked out .
 the detention teacher didn &apos;t give a flying fuck .
 i lost all respect for authority at that school .
 sorry that happened and that the teacher showed no empathy .
 i can say that many teachers don &apos;t have the capacity for classroom management .
 gonna brag - that shit never happened in my class without it being recognized .
 i once had a girl make fun of an autistic classmate .
 he was high-functioning ,  but obviously had social difficulties .
 she made fun of him in front of the class .
 i casually told the boy to go to the main office to get me a red science pencil ,  or something made up .
 once he left ,  i tore that girl a new one ,  and when i was done with her ,  i ripped the other kids for sitting there and allowing it to happen .
 i explained to them how being indifferent to abuse/bullying is just as bad .
 that shit was just not tolerated in my class .
 i told them if they learn nothing about math or science in my class (i had them for both subjects - 6th grade) ,  i &apos;m going to at least teach them to be decent human beings .
 thanks for the gilding !
 some people asked for a little more background .
 i am a white male ,  worked in a title 1 (lower income - majority of students qualified for free or reduced lunch) ,  mainly hispanic (primarily mexican) ,  in los angeles county .
 there have been numerous times where i didn &apos;t teach according to the standards that day ,  as i took time to teach about the jewish ,  armenian ,  hutu/tutsi ,  cambodian ,  and other genocides from the 20th century ,  as well as other teachable moments (lighter-skinned hispanic kids calling darker ones the  &apos;n &apos; word ,  why hitler jokes aren &apos;t appropriate ,  why i &apos;ve never hit my children or wife ,  etc .
 i wish there were humanities lessons/classes throughout the grades ,  but ,  alas ,  those subjects aren &apos;t on the standardized tests .
 i got beaten up till i passed out ,  thrown in dumpsters ,  they invented a game  &apos;hit the nerd &apos; where they tried to kick a ball as hard as they could against my head when i was crying behind a tree because i couldn &apos;t handle it .
 i almlsf attempted suicide when i was 9 .
 i got bullied for 3 years after that and i get bullied again now .
 i am getting therapy because i finally told my parents how bad i feel (i &apos;m 15 now)  .
 as a middle school teacher i want to sincerely apologize for that dumb fuck teacher .
 i would’ve protected you honey because you deserve to be adored not to be bullied .
 i hope you’re doing better now
 i know what you mean .
 i took my son out of school at age 16 for the same reason ,  before he became a suicide victim or a school shooter .
 as well as being bullied and ignored ,  he was incredibly intelligent and a science teacher told him black holes didn &apos;t exist .
 anyway ,  he had his ged a year before his class graduated and he is now a productive well-balanced adult .
 i remember once we were driving and stopped behind a car with a bumper sticker that said  &apos;teachers change lives &apos; he said ,   &apos;wow .
 truth ,  huh mom ?
 best wishes hon ,  i hope you &apos;re okay .
 schools need a fucking justice system .
 teachers are not capable of keeping things just and bullies getting away with everything is part of the reason shootings keep happening in buildings full of children .
 my little sister tried out middle school once (we &apos;re both homeschooled) and apparently there was a girl who &apos;s hair was being yanked by 3 other girls ,  and when someone went to tell a teacher ,  the teacher told them to  &apos;mind their own business &apos; .
 you were ,  and are ,  very strong to handle it by just tossing the weapon .
 sorry you had to go through that .
 hey man ,  glad you pulled through .
 my dad (single father) wasn &apos;t a drunk but beat me for just about anything including forgetting things like taking out the trash or getting a b in school .
 at around 12 i was removed after he whipped me with a studded belt and split long ,  open lacerations  on my ass cheeks and bruised me black and purple from back to thigh when i was about twelve .
 i told them of the ongoing abuse and begged never to go back but i was put right back a week later and all my family told me i was a piece of shit for ratting and it only got worse) when i was around 16 i got fed up .
 i didn &apos;t think about killing myself until a few years later and depression lasted 15 years .
 anyways ,  i took one of his guns and when he wasn &apos;t paying attention i pulled it out and aimed at his head .
 it was probably only a second or two but it was also an eternity .
 the utter hopelessness ,  betrayals ,  emotional pain ,  loneliness ,  believing i was hated by my own father ,  and the feeling trapped was warring with my nature ,  reason ,  and love for him despite it all .
 i &apos;m extremely pacifistic physically and i &apos;ve almost never wished real harm on even people i really felt i hated .
 it was like there were two me &apos;s each fighting for control of my body .
 i put quite a bit of pressure on that trigger knowing full well it could go off any moment and there &apos;s no return before realizing i really didn &apos;t want to be violent like him or worse ,  even if i felt pretty justified at the time .
 i put it back in my pocket and walked off .
 he never saw and i &apos;ve never told a soul until now .
 i honestly hadn &apos;t even remembered in more than a decade .
 anyways ,  i &apos;m sorry people have to go through that .
 i know what my despair felt like and i sympathize .
 what you did took strength and we &apos;re here because we &apos;re strong ,  not because we &apos;re weak .
 i often have trouble still believing that and still struggle bad with self worth and a few other things and i try to remind myself of that .
 i don &apos;t know if you are still in a place where you need to hear it but i thought i &apos;d share and relate and say it anyways for both of us .
 thank you for caring .
 my best friend grew up in the system and the only reason he survived it was thanks to people like you so thank you .
 thank you for doing this work .
 i hope the people you’re helping realize it one day .
 my mom essentially helps kids in difficult situations at school and man ,  the stories she tells .
 it’s mostly either the lack of funding or the absolute ignorance or unwillingness of the staff (school ,  the state or anything else ,  even other social workers) that is stopping the kids from getting help .
 thank you for doing what you can .
 hey what youre doing is great .
 i really enjoyed reading this and i really hope your influence will grow big in improving the system some day
 same type of thing going on with my job .
 the thing is no ones quitting except for me .
 there are only a couple of people i legitimately don’t mind .
 the rest are either rude or unbearable to be around .
 now i haven’t been the hardest worker there myself honestly as it’s a minimum wage job ,  but still you can’t treat someone like that .
 isn &apos;t being treated like a nuisance when requesting supporting documents just the best ?
 (especially for doing walkthroughs) :p .
 and when you realize the client didn &apos;t give everything needed ,  its suddenly you who must be at fault ,  and it seems that both the client &apos;s staff and your own in-charges are ganging up on you ?
 also ,  the very idea of  &apos;time budgets &apos; can fuck right off .
 what do you do now ,  if i may ask ?
 how many busy seasons did you go through ?
 when i was an auditor there was a joke around our office .
 “being an auditor is like being a hooker .
 you do awful things for your clients ,  you spend a lot of time at the hotels ,  and each day you look into the mirror and think i won’t be doing it for the rest of my life” .
 you’ve just described my current life situation to the max !
 first ,  i’m so sorry you grew up in that environment and i’m very happy (and proud) you’ve moved out and on with your life .
 it sucks so bad that the very people you’re supposed to “rely” on ,  are the very people who beat you down .
 how did you get out of it or if you had advice for someone in a similar situation ,  what advice would you give them ?
 ha ha i &apos;m this but poor
 holy shit ,  this is a perfect description of my household .
 like 5 - 6 years ago my mom found out that my dad was having an affair and they &apos;ve been arguing every since .
 i can tell that they don &apos;t trust each other at all ,  and i don &apos;t understand why they aren &apos;t divorced at this point .
 i know that feeling ,  sort of .
 my parents divorced when i was young ,  i was about 6 .
 my dad eventually got a girlfriend when i was about 11 or 12 ,  and she had three kids .
 they were okay people ,  as far as i knew .
 my dad had started a business as a traveling phone card salesman .
 he &apos;d go from bodega to bodega restocking the phone cards they ordered and presenting them with new options .
 he would pick me up for the weekend and take me to work .
 this was our bonding time .
 i remember once while he was showing me how to fill out an invoice that he mentioned i should learn it because i was going to take over ,  but he never mentioned that again .
 he did pretty well for himself ,  eventually opening up a store of his own ,  which had phone booths that you &apos;d control from a computer behind the main desk .
 it would route calls through specific networks to get the lowest price to the caller &apos;s destination .
 anyway ,  i told you all of that to tell you that i eventually became his tech support when i was about 14 .
 i helped set up some .
 of his tech at the store ,  and kept it running .
 he didn &apos;t pay me or anything ,  and i even helped run the store after he had a stroke .
 at some point i guess his girlfriend wanted more money so she just took it out of the register .
 i came to find out she blamed me for it ,  and my dad believed her .
 we stopped talking for about 10-15 years .
 i have no use for that ,  and he wasn &apos;t a great dad to begin with .
 he had been abusive to my mom when i was 4-5 ,  and i don &apos;t care to give him much rope to bother hanging himself .
 he now tries to talk to me .
 i humor him and answer the phone once or twice a year .
 i don &apos;t do anything to hurt him ,  but i have no reason to change my life to make his any better or worse .
 they &apos;re your children ,  and if you don &apos;t want them in a particular environment then it &apos;s your decision ,  nobody else &apos;s .
 if it makes feel any better i have what i call an ass-dad .
 he &apos;s my bio dad but with the way he treated mom and i for a long time ,  with it culminating in him saying he didn &apos;t give a fuck about me a few years ago ,  that bridge burnt itself .
 i only talk to him when i &apos;m forced to now for whatever reason .
 if he wants a relationship it &apos;s up to him to fix it .
 so far he hasn &apos;t tried ,  so i don &apos;t view it as my problem .
 in therapy now and agree with you .
 sadly ,  burning down the bad stuff has included my family .
 i am happy you are better off today than yesterday .
 my therapist is big on reminding me that i can &apos;t control others but also it &apos;s amazing what wonders i have achieved by saying things like ,   &apos;stop enabling her on my behalf &apos; and  &apos;i don &apos;t know ,  why don &apos;t you call her and ask &apos; when my family tries to draw me into drama .
 i came from a similar background .
 it &apos;s hard being trapped in a fundamentalist cult as a child of a single parent .
 my mom went from hippy-bartender to hardcore evangelical christian over night .
 i was 13 and was like ‘wtf’ where’s the tv ,  stereo my fuckin clothes !
 everything went into the dumpster and she quit her job .
 like we’re living in a trailer park and god says you have to quit your job because the man of the house should provide .
 i fuckin hate top ramen .
 ruined my teenage years all together ,  can’t play sports because it’ll interfere with church ,  wanna go to a dance ?
 wanna field trip ,  friends over ,  band ,  skateboard or get a damn job .
 seriously church 8 times a week ,  shit had me borderline suicidal .
 i never accepted the church and was treated like dirt by all the “brothers & sisters” because i wouldn’t pretend to be “saved” .
 i fled the state at 17 and joined the military ,  finally talked to my mom 8 years later .
 i got shunned for holding hands with my bf .
 i was a virgin .
 but to the mormon ladies i went to church with ,  i was a harlot and a whore .
 i left shortly after .
 i feel you here .
 also happy cake day !
 just go on vacation for a month .
 then they’ll know what you do for them
 im guessing there are cases of patient abuse and neglect in your hospital ?
 how simple minded do you have to be to think “they have x hairstyle ?
 that means they do y .
 damn ,  i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
 i feel like a lot of us would be very interested in hearing your story on how you got out .
 that sounds awful ,  and i &apos;d understand if you don &apos;t want to get into it ,  but i would love to hear more about what happened .
 you were 20 ,  and the police just brought you back without asking questions or otherwise determining whether you were a child or an adult ?
 what cult was it ?
 how’d you eventually get out ?
 you can’t just leave off with that .
 tell us what happened !
 i had a simar experience ,  the entire school was preparing for this huge musical .
 i was part of the tech crew so sound lights etc .
 there was this one girl (part of the in clique) who was the only nice one ,  especially to me .
 we mat in private 2 times and she would text me a lot .
 then in the week before the first show of the musical ,  she humiliated me by claiming she was just pranming me ,  showing others in front of me our private texts ,  and then admitting that she started to date one of my best friends already .
 i felt so destroyed ,  on the day she performed ,  i was doing the lights and another kid the sound ,  he had everything set up for the song and left for the bathroom while she was about to start singing .
 i saw all the controls for her mic on the sound board ,  and as she opened her mouth i slowly turned down her monitor speaker .
 (for everyone who doesn &apos;t know ,  the monitor is just heard on stage by the singer ,  it &apos;s so that you can actually hear yourself sing ,  with all the music etc next to you .
 without its like singing while holding your ears closed ,  it will basically sound like you have no feel for tone ,  because without the monitor you don &apos;t) .
 this was over 8 years ago .
 i &apos;m still very good friends with the guy she actually dated .
 he told me she was really insane .
 the type to send death threats after him not texting back for 5 minutes ,  after they broke up .
 holy shit ,  my first awards earned for doing something mean back in school .
 and people said it won &apos;t matter later on :d
 very sorry to hear that .
 theatre can definitely be an aggressive environment ,  and it &apos;s unfortunate when people make it more stressful than it needs to be .
 as someone looking into theatre programs at different colleges ,  would you mind telling me what college this was ?
 i would like to make sure to avoid them
 building their entire persona on empathy .
 it always seems to me that people who fit that description are rotten on the inside .
 lol sometimes the op quote is a meaningful reminder for our compassion for others .
 and sometimes it &apos;s emblematic of all our fiery ,  angsty teen hormone rage .
 thats why i stopped playing mario party .
 yeah this kind of teenage rage is what i expected more of itt ,  but on a larger scale .
 like for every school shooter ,  i &apos;m assuming there must be hundreds who &apos;ve considered it and many who &apos;ve come close .
 craaaaaawwwwwling in my skiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnn
 my sister pawned my guitar .
 i got it back (she griped about having to pay extra to get it out) ,  but then she asked if she could pawn it again for some money .
 i know ,  it &apos;s nowhere near just stealing ,  but i lent her the guitar in goodwill ,  and she pawned it for pot money .
 i just needed to get this out ,  thanks
 breaks my heart hearing stories like this .
 i hope you &apos;re doing ok now and have found people that support and love you for you .
 your story stuck out for me .
 in that moment ,  you were death .
 peter at the gates .
 when time came for him to be judged ,  the one who showed up was you--the person he kicked when they were down .
 he knew what he did was bad ,  and he knew what was coming was deserved .
 but instead ,  you showed him kindness and forgiveness .
 that was a gift and a beautiful story .
 hopefully your kindness helped put him on a different path .
 you are awesome .
 im sorry ,  that pains me to hear that happened to you ,  people can be so cruel and you didn &apos;t deserve the torture .
 this sounds like kidspeace .
 the guy in the room next to me was hooked up to an iv of deer tranquilizer all day for months at a time .
 the one day that someone forgot about him ,  he woke up .
 he was a normal kid ,  abandoned by his parents .
 except i wasn &apos;t malnutritioned and being heavily sedated for months straight .
 kidspeace is also a place where you can send your mexican kids to so that they can get citizenship illegally .
 you should make the call .
 people in already fragile mental states deserve compassion not fear .
 if you can’t for you do it for them .
  reach out if you need more pep talk !
 that last paragraph was poetic ,  how are you doing/feeling now ?
 sorry internet pal that sounds shitty for you
 such a literal response to the question .
 i wouldn &apos;t have even let her stay over in the first place .
 points to you for giving her some semblance of a chance .
 she is a bitch and you honestly deserve better .
 you &apos;ll get a lot of  &apos;they don &apos;t deserve you !
  &apos; or  &apos;you &apos;ll make tons of new friends !
 but the truth is ,  some people are just fucked up .
 nothing you could &apos;ve done would &apos;ve changed that .
 that happens sometimes in friendships ,  it happens at work ,  and it sometimes happens in intimate relationships .
 the best way to protect yourself is by remembering that your friendship is valuable .
 if you see red flags early ,  give them some space .
 if they keep reaching out to you ,  they may be worth giving some extra time to .
 congrats on school ,  don &apos;t drink too much :)
 recently had something similar happen to me .
 i had a pretty sizeable friend group (about 8 people) before i moved states a few years ago .
 i’ve kept in touch with most of them through dms and the like .
 i told them i was coming to visit for a week months in advance ,  and we all even discussed dates and plans as the date got closer .
 we even had the time set !
 in the last few days before the agreed-upon date ,  everyone cancelled .
 i only had 2 people left the day before we planned to meet ,  and they cancelled last minute for bullshit reasons .
 if they didn’t want to hang out ,  why did we bother setting specific plans on a specific time and date ?
 i had a lot of fun hanging out with the other friend i was staying with though .
 at least i know who to not make plans with next year .
 they didn’t deserve your friendship .
 go to college and find the friends who will appreciate you .
 you know ,  fuck those kids that say fuck your friends .
 that shit hurts .
 as a person who went through that exact sort of situation ,  it &apos;s hard to forget the rejection of the people you first felt close to .
 it &apos;s like your first significant other; nothing is quite as painful .
 sure ,  you &apos;ll make good friends in college and you &apos;ll end up being fine ,  but nothing hurts more than losing the trust of your teenage peers .
 you &apos;ve probably never felt that level of kinship with anyone ,  and i &apos;m sorry you feel abandoned .
 it &apos;s a formative thing that everyone has to go through and it sucks .
 even your fairweather friends ,  whom i &apos;m sure you envy ,  are feeling the same things about other people .
 it &apos;s just what teenagers do .
 i &apos;d add some sort of encouraging message at the end here if you hadn &apos;t already gotten that in earlier comments .
 i just want to let you know that i &apos;ve felt that too .
 you &apos;re not alone .
 you &apos;ll meet many more people in your life that will treasure you .
 this group of flakes will be a distant memory as you move on to bigger and better things .
 you wont miss them .
 hey there ,  so ,  we see that you &apos;d like to set corporate on fire .
 i &apos;ll be honest ,  champ ,  i always knew you had a drive to you deep down ,  but i gotta be honest ,  i don &apos;t know if wholesale fire is the deliverable we want to be focusing in on currently .
 you know we &apos;re currently spitballing here to really incentivize growth hacking but the bottom line is that synergy and out-of-the-box thinking has always been our wheelhouse .
 we can onboard similar strategy initiatives ,  sure ,  but i was really hoping you were paying more attention in seminar last week because we really covered this stuff already .
 burning to death in a screaming corporate inferno really doesn &apos;t demonstrate thought leadership or that  &apos;make-it-happen &apos; mindset we &apos;re holding as our central paradigm .
 the stakeholders just won &apos;t swing for perishing in cleansing waves of pure heat and light until skin literally boils and sloughs off .
 it &apos;s kinda low hanging fruit when we &apos;re always striving for industry-best practices by and large .
 just keep these points on your radar going forwards and remember ,  we &apos;re mostly interested in right-sizing more than asphyxiating on chokingly-thick smoke and passing out before the flames wrap around you like a smothering cloak of searing pain and numb whiteness .
 speaking broadly about the market ,  we wanna disrupt the space but we can &apos;t go boiling the ocean every b2b brainstorm .
 just keep working on that 30 , 000 foot view and we &apos;ll circle back tonight .
 speaking of ,  we need you to stay in late if that &apos;s ok .
 perfect ,  see you then .
 i &apos;ve only heard it in the black panther movie but it is a great one
  &apos;what &apos;s the matter ?
 somebody steal your sweetroll ?
 i was really angry about something not very important ,  so i went on red dead redemption and went and shot up the monestary .
 my brother came into the room and saw me screaming at the tv while slaughtering nuns .
 do you get to the cloud district often ?
 oh ,  what am i saying; of course you don &apos;t .
 you didn &apos;t deserve that .
 i hope you &apos;re doing well these days .
 what the actual fuck
 middle school was the worst .
 find a fresh start and make friends .
 my recommendation is to join an activity and make older friends who don &apos;t know you yet .
 i had to completely reinvent myself going into high school ,  and now people like me .
 i was borderline suicidal ,  and my  &apos;friends &apos; used me as someone to bully .
 if i could be popular ,  you sure as hell can .
 call the local police and/or sheriff &apos;s office and inform them of this .
 don &apos;t give them any info about your new whereabouts ,  other than that it &apos;s intentionally far away .
 that way if your family tries to file a missing persons report ,  law enforcement won &apos;t act on it .
 this is something that abuse survivors are encouraged to do and it sounds like your situation qualifies .
 good for you ,  i hope everything works out well for you .
 that &apos;s pretty cool .
 what is your industry that your family disdains ?
 congratulations ,  and welcome to a new life of peace .
 i &apos;m happy for you .
 i love to hear stories like these .
 sounds like the people over at r/insaneparents would love to hear your story .
 you should make a post there along with follow on updates; i would be interested in hearing more about it .
 i &apos;m sure you already thought of this ,  but make sure you take all important documentation and you get some sort of credit monitoring service .
 i could see vindictive family members doing scummy things in your name as soon as you &apos;re gone .
 i don &apos;t know how to put this in words properly .
 you are someone i &apos;de look up too ,  you are a tenacious person and i &apos;m thrilled you have found a new life away from them .
 i watched people who have been treated badly keep that hate in them and it doesn &apos;t help ,  they ruin themselves and never truly enjoy their lives .
 good luck to you on your new adventure .
 you &apos;re good people .
 the flames licked higher and higher up the sides of the strip mall ,  smoke billowing out in dark ,  twisting columns to the grey sky above .
 you hold a gas can in your left hand and your expired driver &apos;s license in your right .
 in the picture ,  you hold an impatient ,  stressed-out look ,  but in that moment ,  your face is split by a widening grin of satisfaction finally granted .
 you watch a beam collapse and fall in front of the door as the employees and patrons within panic and run about like chickens sans heads .
 they approach the collapsed beam and beg you for help .
 in that moment ,  you are in two places at once .
 you are in front of the dmv as it burns in a blazing conflagration .
 you are inside the dmv ,  and it is not on fire .
 you have been there for three hours and you &apos;ve already missed an  &apos;unmissable &apos; meeting .
 you &apos;re begging the clerk for help ,  if there &apos;s anything you can do or she can do to help oil the gears a little bit .
 you &apos;re outside the dmv ,  and the fires close in as dmv employees beg you to help them with the collapsed beam blocking the door .
 you &apos;re back inside the dmv ,  and the clerk is saying something unhelpful to you .
 you are outside the burning storefront ,  and your lips form the exact same words you heard all those years ago:  &apos;please take a number and wait patiently .
 we &apos;ll try our best to make it quick .
 when the flames finally reach them ,  you &apos;re not certain if they &apos;re flailing in agony or dancing in an abject ecstacy ,  a celebrated freedom at long last from the banality of their jobs in that hellscape on earth .
 they slump back ,  spent in their jubilations ,  and are then one with the blaze until man and floor and roof and expired licenses and form 716a and driver &apos;s ed books all return to ash hand-in-hand in a beautiful-yet-final ultimate act of unity .
 a peace falls over the lot ,  and a warmth settles in your heart .
 i always am kind to everyone ,  but remember ,  if you act like a bitch ,  you’re gonna get treated like one .
 where did he even get african from ?
 i &apos;m sorry that you felt neglected .
 because you were neglected .
 but i hope you also understand that these circumstances were crazy extraordinary .
 i &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
 the best revenge is living well .
 that way you can actually see their reactions
 we didn &apos;t start the fire .
 yea we didn &apos;t light it but we &apos;re trying to fight it .
 i nearly had a stroke reading your username ,  but man i relate .
 the total fire ban in australia means camping and parties aren’t the same as they used to be
 my idiot self misunderstood the question .
 wait ,  tell us how she no longer works there !
 what went down ?
 you finish this god damn story right now .
 i have got to hear the long story for this
 finish the damn story
 i believe in you my dude .
 you don’t need toxic people in your life .
 stay strong and much love !
 it feels pretty good to talk about it .
 i &apos;m doing better ,  and telling people about my experiences and letting them know it gets better makes me feel good !
 thanks for the nice comment as well !
 well is ,  a very interesting individual .
 if you were to meet her in person ,  you &apos;d probably like her .
 that &apos;s the type of person she is: funny ,  spiritual ,  charismatic ,  just all around the type of person people want to be around .
 the wild stories i could tell you lol .
 but ,  fortunately for her i guess ,  she &apos;s getting clean .
 she smokes the occasional blunt and drinks to hell and back ,  but she &apos;s doing better .
 but to answer your question .
 people like that are just miserable on the inside .
 broken beyond repair ,  and no matter how well she does ,  she will never see the light at the end of the tunnel because she is so unhappy .
 i pity her more than i could ever hate her .
 it was long long ago ,  all healed now .
 but that was the closest i ever came to saying  &apos;fsck the whole world ,  let it burn &apos;
 but luckily i live 3000 miles away from her now .
 she isn &apos;t a part of my life anymore .
 not for the past 15 years .
 the absurd thing is we made no commission .
 she was doing this for her own bragging rights and to look better than the dept in sales numbers .
 unfortunately ,  it has a mixed ending .
 i left that job a couple months later to move to korea .
 i was asked to work there again when i returned a year later ,  but was denied only by the one manager who is still there that i filed the complaint against .
 as a middle child whose not a total piece of shit this is slanderous .
 honestly sounds like baby behavior ,  not middle child 
 the words  &apos;non-commision &apos; ,   &apos;credit apps &apos; ,  and  &apos;high gsp &apos; really cemented the idea in my head .
 it &apos;s really competitive and i believe it encourages management to only care about results .
 especially because they bonus off of it .
 that &apos;s exactly what they did .
 and i &apos;d have everything cleaned ,  restocked ,  and ready to go before they got back .
 when i worked at mcdonald &apos;s ,  everyone got a 10 minute ,  on the clock ,  coke break every two hours .
 use it however you wish .
 for me ,  it meant sitting outside with a soda playing snake on my sweet new nokia .
 for others ,  smoking a cigarette .
 for still others ,  a quick trip to the shed to use whatever illegal drugs they wanted .
 my boss gave me shit once for sitting down in the middle of a 10 hour shift and i just said everyone else gets a fucking smoke break every other hour .
 he hasn &apos;t said a word too me in 2 years .
 there &apos;s just something about this that &apos;s fucking funny and great to me .
 i would but she doesn &apos;t have a house right now ,  she &apos;s living with her brother and i also want to finish the school year .
 she should have full custody by june
 i remember i didn’t want to go to my dads one weekend .
 he called the cops and the cops literally told him that if i didn’t want to go ,  the cop can’t do anything .
 this is the move ,  you won’t get in any trouble for it .
 more like setting a nuke on their own village .
 the lady is working for free ,  and you have the nerve to make her pay you some made up fee .
 yeah its like they gave gasoline ,  matches ,  and a map showing weakpoints on buildungs to the non embraced child
 and they are willing to do it for $5 only lol
 my understanding is the $5 charge were because it was a badge .
 still stupid though .
  yes ,  she stayed; and yes ,  she &apos;s still there every year .
 it’s supposed to be a deterrent so that they keep better watch over their badges .
 it’s treating adults like children who need to be punished .
 that &apos;s a lot of work for $5
 well ,  i &apos;m not sure .
 i &apos;m seeing a therapist now and it &apos;s nice getting some things out and have some sort of support .
 i &apos;m also trying new things to help my mental health but if i &apos;m to be honest ,  just about every other day i wish i was never born and wish i just die in my sleep .
 just make sure you &apos;re off the bridge and no longer need it prior to burning it .
 was gonna post that badass saying if you didn &apos;t already  .
 we live in a world with such nonsensical bureaucracy that sometimes it &apos;s best to cut and run for something more real and meaningful .
 it rings true for a cook like i am ,  no matter your references ,  your skills speak for themselves .
 it &apos;s less true for corporate jobs where resume means everything .
 bad priests can be like that .
 a baby can &apos;t have a faith .
 they &apos;re a baby .
 but some priests are so caught up in their own prejudice against non-christians that they lose sight of their actual job: helping those who are not already saved .
 it &apos;s like not helping the sick so that you can tend to the healthy .
 it &apos;s not something that a good priest would ever do .
 i hope she told every person she could .
 anybody who has a healthy faith wouldn &apos;t want to be part of a church that does that .
 the first question asked  &apos;was the baby christian ?
  &apos; as if any other baby would not be worth mentioning .
 i wonder why christians seem to find it so hard to act in a  &apos;christian &apos; manner .
 you &apos;d have thought it would have been pretty simple ,  given that it &apos;s the entire premise of the whole charade .
 reminds me of the mahatma gandhi quote: “i like your christ ,  i do not like your christians .
 your christians are so unlike your christ .
 i used to go to a private christian school .
 like many others ,  i was once christian and stopped being so after graduating .
 i didn &apos;t like the cliques within the church and how segregated it seemed .
 my school was connected to the church .
 it went from pre-k all the way to grade 12 .
 when i started going to the school at grade 4 ,  it only had a little over 100 students overall .
 you could imagine how cliquey it was from people who did go to church and those who didn &apos;t .
 probably why i went to church semi-regularly .
 helped me to integrate .
 anyway ,  my brother lost his baby to sids at only 3 months old and my family was absolutely devastated .
 this happened while i was grade 7 .
 the school and church were actually pretty great about it .
 they knew my family was not christian .
 at the funeral ,  we still had a couple people from the church (including my principal) show up at the church to offer their support .
 the school even gave me and my sister some time off school to help us recover .
 one of the pastor &apos;s children (owned part of the school and church) even offered some counseling for my brother .
 i can &apos;t remember if he went or went only once but the thought was still there .
 it didn &apos;t matter that he was not christian .
 we still had many problems with the church and the school afterwards ,  part of the reason i am agnostic now but i still appreciate that small sentiment .
 damn you &apos;d think with how close the church is to being dead in the uk that they &apos;d try a little harder to be inclusive and not be assholes
 fuck ,  that’s horrible !
 i was raised in the church by a minister (a good one ,  self-sacrificing and humble , ) and there are positive and negative aspects (that seem to get a lot more attention .
 ) with that said ,  who the fuck acts like that ?
 that vicar clearly doesn’t understand his role in the church ,  how to be compassionate ,  or how to interact on a basic level with other human beings .
 i &apos;ve personally tested that in conversations and it &apos;s mostly pissed everyone off ,  which is both funny and hypocritical
 i have an older brother that likes to talk a lot and has interrupted me my whole life .
 it &apos;s nothing malicious he just can &apos;t help himself .
 at a family gathering a couple of years ago 20 people are sitting around a large dinner table and while i was talking across the table my brother interrupts me but i continue talking except now i &apos;m yelling my words out at top volume and as soon as he stopped talking i return to a normal descible and finish what i was saying .
 everyone stared at me in silence as my brother asks me if i &apos;m ok .
  &apos;you don &apos;t have to yell .
 i raise my hand .
 just about everybody automatically falls back to grade school rules .
 it forces the group to acknowledge you and it &apos;s easy to say your peace .
 i dunno ,  i kinda like the airhorn suggestion better .
 i work for a company that takes inclusion very seriously ,  and i’m a mile-a-minute talker ,  so i sometimes have to get curbed by other people for inadvertently interrupting .
 my favorite method is one which my manager uses .
 when someone starts to interrupt him ,  he just continues to talk ,  puts a finger up and says ,  “sorry-“ and gets right back to what he was saying .
 its almost like re-interrupting ,  but its more about asserting that you had the right of way in conversation .
 i’ve seen lots of women in my workplace use this with some success as well ,  although a lot of men are just dicks and run on anyway .
 its a real problem in the us supreme court .
 i spent most of my life waiting for people to stop talking so i could jump in during the pause that tv and movies have taught be is suitably correct .
 i used to secretly think that i was being smarter or better behaved by not jumping into a conversation .
 but then i realised that the people who are doing the interrupting often interrupt each other without any malicious intent ,  and often keep the conversation going without shouting over each other .
 it &apos;s just a more dynamic style of conversation where everyone actively participates .
 these days i am trying to insert myself more ,  especially with newer people ,  and i find that as long as i don &apos;t do it all the time ,  it &apos;s actually pretty natural .
 i still don &apos;t do it with my brother and sister ,  since i still have that habit of not doing it with them ,  but as a result i often lose my voice when i come home for the holidays and tend to burn out quick waiting for the holidays to be over .
 that would &apos;ve been my instinct .
 one day a teacher threw my stuff into the trash ,  it didn &apos;t take me a second to stand up ,  walk to the teachers shelf and do the same to her things .
 i tried to fight my bullies on multiple occasions (note: the same demographics i mentioned earlier all still applied) and that didn’t turn out so great .
 i’m not a violent person .
 i’m not really a physical person in any way ,  even when it comes to affection .
 but i wanted them to get it over with ,  if fighting was what it took .
 quit throwing stuff ,  quit insulting me ,  let’s just get it all out now .
 i even knew at the time that wasn’t what any of my bullies wanted—it was the satisfaction of doing stupid things that got everybody to laugh at me they wanted—but i couldn’t hold back .
 i wanted them to see me .
 i wanted them to acknowledge me .
 have a go ,  one-on-one ,  and we’ll finish it for good .
 first time got me tripped ,  second attempt was with the same guy and he just ignored me as i repeatedly hit him with my lunchbox (amazing that i never got suspended) and the third time it was with a guy who dodged my attempts to whack him ,  laughing because i was just so angry and i looked pathetic to him .
 use one of those big sturdy umbrellas ,  you can take them in winter and summer without anybody really caring .
 kid knees aren &apos;t strong enough to need bats .
 i &apos;ve been on a similar position for a couple years  .
 mind you i was a 12 year old boy ,  thin ,  avg height .
 for some reason several other students bullied me for two years ,  school staff did nothing .
 i knew how to fight ,  but i did not want to ,  until four of them decided they would kick my ass for giving them a taste of their own medicine  .
 all of that in the classroom while the teacher was out .
 things went bad ,  i lost grip on myself .
 i wanted them all dead ,  so i took the fight to them ,  and somehow i only got a few bruises .
 i don &apos;t remember much but i recall throwing a chair at one of them ,  kicking one of them in the face and almost blacking the last one out on a choker .
 the teacher pulled me off the asshole and of course my parents were called and stuff .
 surprisingly ,  my dad wasn &apos;t mad at me ,  but my mom spent three days scolding me for being suspended because of fighting .
 and this is why i hate people ,  after 10 years .
 what about your friend ,  didn &apos;t that person recognize who the little shits were ?
 it &apos;s not just authority at school unfortunately .
 there are so many modern equivalents of that slap on the wrist shit happening every day .
 i tore that girl a new one .
 ripped the other kids for sitting there and allowing it to happen .
 i explained to them how being indifferent to abuse/bullying is just as bad .
 someone actually acknowledges that those bystanders let something as bad as that happen .
 former middle-school teacher here ,  too .
 i had no respect for teachers who lacked classroom management and allowed kids to get bullied .
 how did i know ?
 because middle school kids tell each other everything .
 i heard about how mr .
 so-and-so allowed this or that to occur in the class .
 not on my watch !
  &apos;what are you gonna do ?
 -man who got stabbed
 after years of taking physical ,  verbal ,  and emotional abuse from her husband ,  our neighbour stabbed her husband through the foot - pinning him to the floor .
 he had punched her in the face ,  knocking her down and as she fell she knocked the knife block which sent them clattering everywhere .
 as she got up to run away ,  the husband grabbed her by the hair so roughly he ripped a part of her scalp off .
 she had another knife in her hand and spun around and stabbed him through the hand .
 she ran out of the house and came to our house across the road .
 my mum pulled her inside and called the police .
 by this point her husband had freed himself from the floor ,  but couldn’t remove the hand knife ,  and limped to our place .
 he’s at our house yelling at us that he was going to kill his wife ,  my mum ,  my sister and i (my dad was away for work) if we didn’t send his wife home right now .
 my mum isn’t the type of person to take threats lightly ,  so she walked out of the house with this giant aboriginal tribal spear (which was completely ornamental and couldn’t hurt you other than being whacked with it) and told this bloke to get the fuck off our property before she sticks him like the pig he is .
 the cops arrived shortly after that .
 old mate went to prison for beating his wife and threatening to kill us .
 they also charged him with possession of a deadly weapon - which i found hilarious because the knife was stuck in his hand so he had no choice but to possess the knife .
 eventually ,  people just get sick of your shit and they’ll fucking stab you if needed .
 or stab you twice if it’s doubly needed .
 it is an absolute fucking travesty that animals like him can inflict such suffering and pain to other people and get away with it .
 how did he even come into your life ?
 how did you get rid of him ?
 this is eerily similar to an event that happened to me at 13 .
 my father was essentially holding my brother and i hostage (your mom owes me money and i won &apos;t send you back to her until she pays up !
 spoiler alert: he actually owed her thousands of dollars that he doesn &apos;t feel like she  &apos;deserves &apos; even though they are court ordered payments and are for the kids ,  not alimony) .
 we got into a huge fight ,  he egged me on to hit him ,  i knew that if i did he would just have an excuse to get violent and a hit from a 13 yo girl wouldn &apos;t do anything .
 so i grabbed the utility knife i had on my bedroom floor (for cutting ,  yay for fucked up coping methods) ,  extended it to the full length ,  and he went batshit .
 snatched it out of my hand ,  threw it against the wall ,  threw me against the wall ,  choked me .
 well ,  that &apos;s where our stories have diverged i guess lol
 i would have just shot something to let off steam .
 especially at just 14
 very easily could’ve been just another lunatic shooter in the news ,  this is how they’re made .
 thanks so much for all your comments ,  i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t reply to them all .
 i made lots of mistakes as a teenager ,  from both a lack of resources and just not knowing what i was doing .
 to be honest now as an adult ,  i can become very impatient and harsh sometimes .
 it &apos;s because now things are going well and i &apos;ve hit my stride in my career ,  so i become unjustifiably frustrated when others make mistakes .
 when that happens i try to remember the amazing people in the system and how patient they were when i was clueless ,  tired ,  or just ungrateful .
 mainly my high school teachers .
 i ended up completing high school part-time while working a couple of jobs ,  and i just didn &apos;t understand many chemistry and math concepts .
 some of it was from skipping school ,  but it &apos;s also just never clicked automatically for me .
 my chemistry teacher helped me at every opportunity and let me submit everything late on the last day of the school year ,  and my math teacher spent most of his lunch hours catching me up with algebra and calculus .
 my art teacher bought all my art supplies and then offered to buy my artwork so i &apos;d have money for university textbooks .
 for the past ten years i &apos;ve held myself and others accountable to the standard of humanity they have set .
 my friend grew up in the system ,  and ran away to survive .
 i saw all this and in my own circumstances took the chance and went on my own .
 lied about my age .
 got a job ,  got an apartment and shared it with him .
 he worked at mcdonald &apos;s and i worked as a dish pig in a cafe .
 we didn &apos;t want to be in the system due to the typical folks you refer to .
 he now lives across the country earning big bucks ,  run his own business and is very happy .
 but has some mental issues he &apos;s working on .
 i &apos;m self employed and very comfortable too .
 but for both of us ,  none of it was smooth sailing at all until my late 30s and his early 40s .
 in my case the main thing was all the good workers were sleeping with each other and that kept work bearable .
  i left and encouraged my fwb to leave .
  she ended up convincing our boss to leave and he took her and my ex &apos;s boyfriend too .
  my ex &apos;s ex ended up getting himself fired on purpose that week and his fuck buddy quit because she &apos;s madly in love with him .
  only my ex still works there ,  and she &apos;s quitting if she doesn &apos;t get the promotion she was promised .
 i work in corporate accounting now - better pay ,  much lower stress and 40 hour weeks .
 went through 2 busy seasons .
 i don &apos;t know how people can make a long-term career of it ,  there &apos;s no work-life balance whatsoever .
 that sucks man ,  really sorry to hear that .
 it’s really hard to deal with but i can guarantee that once you get freedom from that sort of toxic behaviour ,  while it can be really hard to adjust (coping mechanisms that help in abusive households don’t transfer well to other living situations) ,  it’s so much better .
 i got lucky and moved into a house in a nearby city with three friends; splitting the rent and bills on a 4-bedroom house makes it fairly cheap for each person .
 it might vary from where you live but in england you have to be 18 to sign a tenancy agreement and you almost always need a guarantor ,  someone who can cover your rent or any damages if you fail to pay it ,  which was the hardest part in my moving out ,  personally .
 before i was 18 i moved into a friends sofa for 3 months to get away from my folks house for a while .
 i can not recommend it ,  but it worked for me .
 few tips for moving out without parental help:  .
 - life is so expensive .
 things like kitchenware ,  toilet paper ,  shampoo ,  food etc are all big costs .
 shopping in bulk and from cheap supermarkets are a life saver .
 - learning to cook is not only an awesome way to impress friends/dates/whatever it’s also a valuable life skill and who knows ,  you might really enjoy it .
 i found that to be the case .
 - if you end up working a shitty minimum wage job ,  that’s okay .
 it’ll be hard work but keep at it .
 - house share if you can .
 in my city a one bedroom flat costs about £800pm .
 my room in a four bedroom is £375pm .
 - self care is important !
 don’t drink or do drugs too much or too often ,  find time to relax and treat yourself once in a while .
 - lastly ,  while you’re stuck in a shitty situation ,  until you can get out ,  try to keep sane .
 having a group of friends close by or that you see often can be a great way of reminding yourself of who you really are ,  and not what any toxic people who might be saying otherwise .
 that’s all i’ve got i think ,  feel free to pm me anything though .
 sorry if it’s quite rambly or straight up incoherent ,  it’s 5am .
 since moving out moneys been very scarce (minimum wage is shit but hey ho) but i’m glad i got out .
 well off people especially can be scarily egotistical and ignorant .
 because  &apos;what will the neighbors say ?
 i thought i was me but maybe i’m you ,  or maybe you’re me ?
 what does me even mean ?
 fuck it ,  whatever .
 sure it doesn’t matter .
 i got to keep two .
 the rest ,  i had to torch .
 you can’t choose the family you’re born into .
 it hurts ,  but sometimes you’re better for letting them go .
 every time i’ve tried to forgive ,  they ended up reminding me exactly why i had to move on in the first place .
 i wish it was different .
 i had to burn my whole family tree down and salt the earth ,  just so i could have a life that one day might be great .
 i was the weird kid ,  sensitive ,  add ,  highly gifted and awkward .
 a lifetime of sexual ,  physical ,  mental and emotional abuse means i never ever want to see any of those fuckers again .
 if the purge really existed ,  i’d be tempted to go with real fire .
 your comment has intrigued me .
 would you mind sharing what sort of habits involve a cycle of poverty ?
 is this like lottery card addiction ?
 when my mother was dying we couldn &apos;t find a single person in the  supposedly close knit rural community who would come and clean the house ,  despite advertising house cleaning services .
 they would clean everyone else &apos;s house ,  just not ours .
 her long service to the community and the church didn &apos;t matter once my dad was dead ,  after that they shunned her because she was  &apos;not of the body &apos; .
 i literally had the fire department burn the house down after she died .
 same situation for me .
 pentacostals plus a single parent who needs support is a recipe for a lifetime in the church .
 took me 25 years to get out ,  i &apos;m the only one of my family and they still frustrate me daily .
 did she have a psychotic break ?
 i mean ,  what caused her abrupt change ?
 sounds like it took her living situation from semi-decent to really bad ,  so i don’t understand the impetus
 there’s a really good youtube account called “telltale atheist” .
  the guy who runs it was a former jw missionary and is very knowledgeable about it ,  and explains everything they want to keep from the public .
 on my weekends ,  it was me and one other counselor .
  on my  weekends off ,  they had to have 4 counselors .
  they knew how much trust i earned with those patients .
  they paid me $900 a month to make the 45 minute commute when the hospital moved a couple counties over .
  they knew what a good counselor i was .
  but i had dreadlocks and wore silk shirts and shiny ties to work in a psych hospital where ties are absolutely verboten .
  the ceo thought i was a reckless druggie .
   &apos;no dude ,  i just treat the people like they are people .
  &apos;  that was almost 20 years ago and i still have patients from that time who contact me .
 there were a few ,  but not nearly as bad as some places .
  i think that was another reason i wasn &apos;t liked .
  i would report it if i saw it .
  i also tried to unionize the orderlies and low level counselors .
 they have short hair ?
 i bet they cut it
 sorry - i was in a hurry because my husband was waiting for me to watch a show with him .
 i answered the question ,  more or less ,  and didn &apos;t think people would be very interested to hear the rest .
 i never tried to use the knife on the officer .
 it was the only way out that i could think of ,  but i was afraid i might accidentally actually hurt him ,  or he &apos;d hurt me ,  and i couldn &apos;t find the courage .
 i just gave up .
 i sat in his back seat and cried until i got home ,  and just quit trying to escape for at least 8 or 9 months .
 the biggest problem with trying to escape was no id to prove my age .
 the next biggest problem was money .
 i was going to college on a pell grant ,  and was working at the college as a work study .
 michael would have us sign over our checks ,  because  &apos;we didn &apos;t need the money when he was supporting us ,  &apos; and we couldn &apos;t cash the checks without photo id anyway .
 and he wouldn &apos;t let us learn to drive ,  because that would have given us a literal key to independence .
 over the course of almost two years ,  my boss at my work study job got the truth of my home situation out of me ,  and she helped me figure out what to do .
 she told me which documents i would need to find and get hold of to get photo id ,  then when i had my birth certificate and ss card ,  she drove me to the dmv to get an id .
 she also hired me for a second job there at the college ,  tutoring ,  so i was teaching adults to read and teaching braille to the newly blind ,  during every free hour of my day .
 michael never knew about that job .
 every two weeks ,  i &apos;d give michael my check from the one job ,  and my boss would take me to cash the other .
 she also helped me set up a bank account ,  and taught me to drive .
 i found two sisters who were willing to take me in as a roommate ,  and i had enough income to pay my portion of the rent .
 one of the sisters drove out to michael &apos;s property to pick me up ,  and michael called me in as a runaway ,  expecting it to go as it always had .
 but that time ,  i had proof of my age ,  and i was nearly 21 by that time .
 edit (to clarify a few things i keep being asked about): .
 it was a poor community college in arizona in the late 90 &apos;s .
 so small that they had to have many campuses in small towns over about a quarter of the state .
 we didn &apos;t have student id &apos;s .
 the high school in the town where i graduated got photo student id &apos;s sooner than the college did ,  though both were after i was done there .
 my mom filled out my fafsa paperwork ,  w4 &apos;s ,  etc .
 she had my birth certificate and ss card .
 she didn &apos;t need photo id for that stuff .
 once we turned 18 ,  they couldn &apos;t collect welfare for us anymore ,  and sending us to college on the government &apos;s dime while we did work study jobs was lucrative for them .
 it still didn &apos;t leave me any way to prove my age in the middle of the night ,  at the side of a highway ,  when cops would ask for id i didn &apos;t have ,  when they had a report of a runaway teen matching my description .
 as to how we got to and from the college ,  one of the mothers drove us everywhere .
 she was the only one allowed to drive .
 that &apos;s why i was at the college long enough hours to have a second job michael didn &apos;t know about .
 we would pile into the vehicle and arrive there at 7:00 am ,  when the earliest classes started ,  and all leave together at 9:00 or 10:00 pm ,  depending on our class schedules for that semester .
 i can &apos;t really answer the question about why i never ran away from the college itself ,  and always ran at night .
 part of it was that one of the few things the kids could do to get approval from michael ,  was to tell him something another of us was doing  &apos;wrong ,  &apos; so the people who should have been my allies were constantly policing me instead .
 also ,  if i left during the day ,  someone at the small college or in the small town ,  would be able to tell michael who they had seen me with .
 but i honestly don &apos;t remember thinking about it very much ,  like ,  in retrospect i can see reasons i wouldn &apos;t have done it that way ,  but i can &apos;t remember actually even thinking about it at the time .
 like it somehow just never occurred to me .
 i guess mostly it was just that night time felt safe and secret ,  and daytime felt exposed .
 michael called me in as a runaway child .
 i fit the description they had of the runaway child .
 the one time i tried to lie about my name ,  i couldn &apos;t think of the next lie about who i was instead of myself ,  or who my pretend parents were ,  and they knew i was lying .
 here’s the thing: desert and multiple wives means one thing: flds in southern utah .
 i felt so destroyed ,  on the day she performed ,  i was doing the lights and another kid the sound ,  he had everything set up for the song and left for the bathroom while she was about to start singing .
 i saw all the controls for her mic on the sound board ,  and as she opened her mouth i slowly turned down her monitor speaker .
 (for everyone who doesn &apos;t know ,  the monitor is just heard on stage by the singer ,  it &apos;s so that you can actually hear yourself sing ,  with all the music etc next to you .
 without its like singing while holding your ears closed ,  it will basically sound like you have no feel for tone ,  because without the monitor you don &apos;t) .
 and that is why you never fuck with the stagehands .
 having sang without a monitor ,  genius move ,  my man .
 university of idaho
 western michigan university was the same way .
 when i started as a freshman ,  i made good friends with some juniors and seniors .
 my closest mentor there told me ,   &apos;don &apos;t trust anyone here ,  not even me .
 he was absolutely right (not about not trusting him .
 he was fine ,  he just wanted to emphasize that there are no exceptions) .
 it was very cut-throat there .
 i stuck to backstage theater ,  but the acting & musical theater departments were even worse .
 yeah ,  if an institution cultivates a whole ideology around a certain virtue ,  chances are they have had (and probably continue to have) problems with a lack of that very virtue among their ranks .
 truly empathetic and nurturing groups don’t need to advertise it or indoctrinate it .
 they just act like it ,  and it goes without saying .
 in my early teens ,  i hated people and myself .
 i was lonely ,  had no friends ,  had virtually nothing to live for .
 nobody would invite me to anything ,  i wasn’t a loser either .
 everyday i felt anger towards myself and others .
 why did nobody care about me ?
 why am i so alone ?
 nothing made me happy ,  but everything made me hate myself .
 i came so close to killing myself or finding some way to get revenge on those who have tormented me .
 i moved away to the other side of my state ,  where i was invisible for a year ,  until a girl at school approached me .
 we clicked almost instantly .
 she would induct me into her friend group ,  and for the first time ever ,  i felt like i belonged somewhere .
 she moved away a year later ,  yet i remained in my same friend group .
 we reunited years later ,  and this woman would soon become my fiancée .
 everything went great ,  up until the day she cheated on me with my best friend ,  marrying him two months later .
 i’m in a much better place now ,  but let me be your example of how life can get so much better if you just give things time .
 fucking mario kart ,  literally destroying friendships since inception .
 ”you used a fucking blue shell !
 also substitute lightning .
 bonus stars are bullshit tbh
 imo that definitely is stealing
 equal parts pain and pleasure ,  ease and hardship .
 yeah ,  it wasn &apos;t a great time .
 but i figure we all have our own stories and pain .
 life can be difficult but at least i &apos;m not running out of burning rooms everyday .
 that ,  but also op could be the shitty friend .
 i had a  &apos;friend group &apos; my senior your of high school and we did everything together .
 there was this sophomore that tried way too hard to break in .
 she was annoying and insecure and the just didn &apos;t fit the dynamic .
 i invited about 15 friends including her to my grad party ,  and my 3 best friends to camp out in my backyard .
 she was pissed as fuck when she wasn &apos;t one of the campers .
 there are a whole lot of redditors that will say we  &apos;didn &apos;t deserve her &apos; ,  but she threw a tantrum at my own grad party two months before i left the state forever because she desperately wanted to belong to a group and we couldn &apos;t be that for her .
 not shitting on what you said but to be realistic: no .
 this is not guaranteed to happen .
 in high school the exact thing the person you &apos;re responding to said also happened to me .
 then again in college .
 then again in the real world .
 i &apos;ve been doing a lot of soul searching since high school on why i &apos;m not good at keeping friends .
 i may be an asshole .
 i may just be unlucky in friendship the way some people are unlucky in love .
 either way not everyone finds that group of friends that treat them well .
 this hurt me physically to read
 a part of me want &apos;s to give you gold for this .
 a part of me wants to kick you in the nuts .
 as per my last email .
  you forgot drill down .
 oh ,  and remember ,  next friday is hawaiian shirt day .
 so ,  you know ,  if you want to ,  go ahead and wear a hawaiian shirt and jeans .
 you forgot to mention quality and iso 9001 .
 other than that ,  epicly awesome .
 brb siphoning some gas .
 wakanda is the worst corporation of all
 why is this so relatable
 thanks man ,  appreciate it
 also won &apos;t waste police resources !
 i’m published by a major company and it’s selling pretty well .
 we signed on the dotted line months ago and i’ve kept it hidden from the family .
 the first checks are coming in now and i can afford to move away .
 i’m moving to the city my publisher is in for convenience ,  and because it’s a nice place .
 i already have my birth certificate and social security card in hand .
 i lied to my dad about needing them for a job application so he’d fish them out of the closet for me .
 thank you ,  that really means a lot .
 i live for better or worse ,  on my trauma .
 it &apos;s taught me a lot and i try not to live in fear ,  but it &apos;s important to remember that not everyone should be treated like my toxic ass family was .
 it &apos;s a weird kind of forgiveness .
 i &apos;ll never let them back into my life the way they think they deserve ,  but i guess it lets others take their place .
 cos im high reading this .
 my brain just multiplied .
 it’s been circling around the internet labeled as an african proverb for a while .
 i have no idea where it originated .
 do you think it &apos;s pronounced readreadreedred or readreadreedred ?
 nah ,  gotta say yours was still pretty great
 hell ,  it made me giggle .
 best of the thread
 obviously he torched her with a flamethrower
 playing the long con of racking up a stable record of initiative so she can take days off ,  receive praise and earn potential raises that pay out decently enough ,  or christmas bonuses and such .
 she knew what she was doing .
 she wanted to look good so she could reap the job benefits without exhibiting any real initiative .
 some may say that’s a genius thing ,  i say it’s absurdly lazy to fuck somebody else over to do so .
 why did they help her so much ?
 special things for them or something ?
 maybe try to slowly be less efficient ,  in small enough increments that they wouldn &apos;t notice .
 they didn’t go out one after another ?
 aawwwwww you guys had a drug shed ?
 after stealing the badge
 all fees are made up .
 this is my room on the third floor ,  plus there are cough no fire escapes on this side of the building
 yeah i think it was some stupid  &apos;employee &apos; punishment
 it’s a lost and found .
 no matter what it was it doesn’t cost them anything to give it back .
 doesn’t make sense .
 tbh ,  this irritates me .
 the assholes running the show still get to do it ,  and expoit her passion for the event .
 either take charge or leave imo .
 if they can scam a bunch of people like that ,  they &apos;ll probably get a lot more than $5 .
 because people suck .
 we &apos;ll burn that bridge when we get to it .
 may the bridges you burn be unoccupied and devoid of structural necessity .
 my boss said something like that to me once .
 i said fuck that bridge ,  i &apos;ll swim if i have to .
 company-hopping is pretty common in the corporate world .
 often it &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll get a significant raise .
 \ a baby can &apos;t have a faith .
 they &apos;re a baby .
 it &apos;s not about having faith ,  it &apos;s about being baptized out of  &apos;original sin &apos; .
 some people believe unbaptized dead babies stay in purgatory and can never enter heaven .
 there &apos;s a latin term called limbus infantium meaning  &apos;the limbo of infants &apos; .
 as the church loses members they &apos;re trying to backpedal on this with more palatable explanations .
 in  &apos;my religion &apos; newborn kids aren &apos;t considered to be in a religion to a certain age ,  so regardless if it was (insert a religion here) kid ,  they are all kids and treated as kids .
 also ,  by default ,  all kids go to heaven ,  regardless ,  since they aren &apos;t mature enough to know the difference between the right or the wrong .
 just reading this i can feel a wave of incoming posts in r/aita
 i have a friend who talks over me constantly and i told him about it a few times and nothing changed ,  so now i talk over him too and he gets very angry .
 bad friend ,  but good payback .
 i need to know since that was a glorious move by you .
 i almost rammed a pencil through one of my bullies &apos; hand one time ,  it was the first time i felt that i had lost control of myself .
 i thought i could bottle all of my frustration and not give them the satisfaction of seeing that it was affecting me ,  but the damage just crept up into most areas of my life .
 i did bad with the school work ,  barely had a group of friends ,  ate like shit and only wanted to watch movies and play video games .
 but being made to feel like shit for almost 3 years during middle school really weighted down my own personal development .
 i &apos;m 27 now and i &apos;m doing far better now ,  but i still have the lingering feeling that i &apos;ll never get to be quite right as the rest of the people around me ,  although i &apos;m still trying to get there .
 maybe our experiences were vastly different ,  but i do empathize with you because i know that kids can be fucking despicable ,  and maybe if i &apos;m still somewhat broken ,  i honestly hope that you &apos;re better now .
 i honestly wish for you to find happiness ,  because you and i know what feeling miserable is like ,  and it fucking sucks .
 autistic 6yo me was daily bullied by 3 other kids ,  physically ,  full program .
 teachers never did anything .
 one day i full forced punched the leader bully ,  he started crying and i got scolded by teachers .
 my mum had my back though ,  one of the most important things in my life .
 anyway ,  was pulled from my first school after a year ,  and was better off in a new city .
 at my old company one of my coworkers would openly scream and berate his peers for .
 well fuck if i know .
 he didn &apos;t like someone &apos;s tone in one email ,  he didn &apos;t think the notes that someone took in a meeting were particularly helpful (keep in mind he asked her for the notes because he didn &apos;t bother to take any ,  because he was on his phone the entire time) ,  he thought another coworker &apos;s suggestion during a meeting was shit and he was pissed the client went with her idea .
 several of us went to our manager ,  who had witnessed almost all of the meltdowns because we had an open-floor office plan ,  and his response was ,   &apos;now ,  what do you suppose is causing him to act in this way ?
  &apos; dude ,  we don &apos;t know and we don &apos;t care .
 just do your job as a manager ,  and manage this guy .
 tell him to back down ,  and maybe start having one-on-one meetings with him and get to the root of his behavioral problems .
 we &apos;d tried speaking to the manager individually after each incident ,  but he &apos;d brush it off .
 we thought maybe if we all went together collectively he &apos;d recognize it as a serious problem .
 his solution was to .
 take a high-profile project that someone had worked really hard to both get and lead ,  and give it to angry coworker .
 the reason he gave was that angry coworker wasn &apos;t being  &apos;challenged ,  &apos; and his boredom was causing him to lash out .
 by giving him a healthy output ,  he reasoned ,  the coworker would be happier and eventually we all would to .
 well ,  except for the person who &apos;d worked really hard to get that project and was actually one of the complainants .
 as a consolation prize ,  she &apos;d get to stay on the project ,  not as lead ,  but instead under angry coworker ,  who was now going to be lead .
 because that was going to give him a healthy outlet .
 angry coworker was eventually fired because he did not become happier ,  and actually screamed at janet ,  who ,  had he been paying attention ,  was a vp .
 drunk driver ,  killer of 4 ,  border-hopping ethan anthony couch is one of them .
 rapist brock allen turner is another .
 unless they’ve tried to stand up for others and were dismissed/shamed for it .
 that happens a lot in schools ,  and when you’re dismissed so often ,  you stop trying .
 kinda hope op factored that in too ,  just because you were pushed aside the other times doesn’t mean you should give up .
 legit something a friend overheard once .
 friend lived in a sketchy area of town near a warehouse where a lot of muggings happened .
 he hears one guy go ,   &apos;oh yeah ,  bro ?
 what are you gonna do ?
 you gonna stab me bro ?
  &apos; trying to play tough .
 few seconds later:  &apos;augh !
 you stabbed me ?
 why &apos;d you stab me ,  bro ?
 queue the cops showing up and all that about 5 minutes later or so .
 lol ,  charge him with the knife that &apos;s stuck in his hand .
 maybe the funniest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
 lol ,  that &apos;s some creative judicial work .
 scalp ripped off ,  jesus that’s awful .
 your mom is awesome .
 and that something might just have been his dad
 life dealt you a harsh hand but you encountered kind benefactors who helped you during your most important periods along with putting in your own substantial efforts and never giving up .
 then you went back in and helped others in your past situation .
 you created your own luck and you are a brilliant person .
 fucking sick ,  you are an inspiration to me .
 working at a place with this sort of mess sounds like way too much drama .
 that &apos;s really excellent advice .
 i &apos;m mentoring two young people ,  19 and 21 ,  and both of them think that  &apos;shitty minimum wage jobs &apos; are beneath them .
  there &apos;s nothing wrong with being the person in the friend group who works at mcdonald &apos;s or wherever .
 keep at it ,  move up one job at a time ,  take pride in knowing you are working .
 i feel you ,  man .
  when my mom had a heart attack and later ,  open heart surgery- she never received one call ,  one visit ,  one casserole ,  or card .
  my mother had been going to that church for 20+years .
  she would drive the joy bus ,  take turns running the nursery ,  visit the sick ,  meet in the ladies group ,  and never missed a service .
 i never went back and neither did she .
  years and years we were happily in the ladies &apos; group to do all this for the sick and housebound on a weekly basis .
  not one person in the congregation returned the love my mother had given .
 she did get 1 visit about 2 years out where the preacher came to  &apos;save her from falling to the wayside &apos; and out of church .
  she told him she still talked to god ,  but it seemed like the rest of the congregation needed to reread how to love others and have a talk with him .
 wow ,  i didn’t know the fire department were in the business of deliberately starting fires .
 that must have felt very satisfying .
 wtf does  &apos;not of the body &apos; mean ?
 that’s me ,  my single mom is in a strict assemblies of god church ,  i’ve never believed it and i’m escaping to california when i graduate high school
 as someone who’s been recruited by a cult (but not joined since i thankfully did my research) and had a girlfriend who was ex-cult it’s not too hard for me to see what probably happened .
 cults try to control everything including your social life .
 the one i encountered on the surface just seemed like a tight-knit group of friends and oftentimes that appearance of friendship is a powerful drug .
 there’s a lot of stuff you are willing to do in order to keep your “friends” even if that means abandoning your old life and spending all your free time to remain with them .
 once they have that control of your free time they’ve got you .
 i &apos;m from the netherlands .
 a friend of me back when i was 19 came from a jw family .
 she was sexually abused by her uncle (maybe more people) for years and when she told her parents she got shunned .
 uncle was still welcome .
 i do not know the particulair details ,  but my friendship faded because i was always saving her from stupid situations with guys .
 she really didn &apos;t know the normal boundaries and was always flirting with everyone with a penis .
 she really thought in a way that was normal behavoir .
 i had my own life ,  study in university .
 she was way to broken for me to handle at the time ,  though i really tried .
 it makes me sad knowing i was just another person in her life who let her down ,  but .
 i do not think i could have done any different .
 i battled with depression and dyslexia through university .
 she had a scholarships ,  therapist ,  ect .
 anyway ,  jw are crazy all over the world .
 my middle kid had a jw boy in special education in his class .
 the boy was pulled from school because they had too many party stuff (games ,  events) going on .
 it &apos;s a language/speaking/deaf school ,  so they tie learning to speak to fun things .
 his parents didn &apos;t want that ,  so he didn &apos;t get help with his disability .
 ties are a safety hazard .
 like around machinery .
 the police wear climb on ties for a reason .
 i also tried to unionize the orderlies and low level counselors .
 and there is the real issue .
  management will always give you some weasel words rational reason as to why you are being targeted (i .
 the dreads) ,  but never the real reason .
  in their eyes you are a union troublemaker .
  but hey good for you ,  stick with your principles .
 as someone who spent a lot of time inpatient ,  those places really could use more people like you .
 yeah ,  mentioning organizing a union is a quick way to get on management shit list .
 hell most places they would just fire you .
 have you ever contacted them since or ran into them ?
 that’s absolutely terrifying .
 it’s great you have a support system so willing to help you ,  but i think the most amazing part is your willpower and drive to make a better life for yourself .
 i sincerely hope your life ahead makes up for the past !
 i would read your memoir .
 consider writing it .
 you would help so many women in similar situations .
 i &apos;m so glad you got out !
 sounds like you are doing ok for yourself now .
 what was the hardest thing to adjust to ?
 have you spoken to your mom since ?
 your boss is a god-send
 i bet michael was pretty mad about that .
 i hope everyone else is well .
 has anyone else escaped ?
 i was thinking that or northern arizona .
  either way ,  the cops knew .
 it &apos;s like a race car driver being a douchebag to the pit crew .
 like ,  do you want to crash ?
 sounds like a good story for r/pettyrevenge .
 thank-you for the heads up ,  it &apos;s much appreciated
 this is my greatest fear .
 i try my very best to be a good friend and a decent human being but i’m always concerned that i’m the asshole somehow .
 okay but you said break into your group as in you hadn &apos;t been nice or invited her anywhere .
 op was a part of a friend group that ghosted them basically .
 if you have a friend for any amount of time ,  if they &apos;re actually your friend ,  you should tell them what you don &apos;t like instead of just cold shouldering them out of your life .
 i would say i laughed and then i cried .
 honestly though ,  i just cried and cried some more .
 good heavens ,  man !
 he had a family !
 the new phrase from my wanna-be-cool boss is  &apos;double-click &apos; ,  as in  &apos;these are the high level numbers ,  but when you double-click on the first quarter you see some interesting trends .
  &apos; it &apos;s a slide presentation .
 there is no double-click .
 it &apos;s totally a metaphor .
 and he says it in casual conversation ,  too .
 also agile methodology .
 that &apos;s just wakaganda .
 don &apos;t try to fit in with the cool ones .
 they end up losers .
 i was a cool one ,  now a loser .
 be yourself and you &apos;ll attract the same types of people .
 otherwise ,  you &apos;re just going to be fake and thus ,  a loser .
 you sound a like good kid ,  that means way more than a cple of years of feeling accepted .
 and once you &apos;re an adult ,  you &apos;ll feel like shit 90% time .
 learn to cope and love yourself .
 you got this man !
 would you be comfortable sharing the book ?
 i’m always looking for something new to read .
 i wrote and published an amazon number one release earlier this year and haven &apos;t told many people .
 i was lucky; most of my family always believed in me .
 however ,  i come from a very small town where most people end up in the factories ,  so any dreams of writing books was laughed at .
 in the end ,  i chose not to tell them because it really didn &apos;t matter anyway .
 i respect and admire your wish to remain anonymous ,  but i also understand it .
 i &apos;m high ,  and read the whole thing ,  honestly .
 i felt that ,  all of it lol .
 searched around a bit myself a few months ago .
 best i could do was track it to a facebook post around 2008 which credited  &apos;-african proverb &apos; .
 a roughly similar quote was posted on a few forums as far back as 2003ish as well ,  but they didn &apos;t have  &apos;-african proverb &apos; as an addition .
 if anyone wants ,  they can ask the author (michael meade) if he drew inspiration from a different source for the quote to better track it down .
 doesn &apos;t really exhibit any genius at all tbh just typical lazy scumbag
 lazy managers didn &apos;t want .
 to deal with it  .
 lazy managers are the worst  .
 ( manager here) it &apos;s part of my job to make sure my employees don &apos;t have to deal with crap like that  .
 thats what i &apos;m thinking .
 they were losing money with this chick .
 good on op &apos;s for saying fuck you to them and showing them that she &apos;s not ready to put up with their bullshit
 sounds to me like someone misinterpreted a rule somewhere .
 at my office ,  we have security badges that work the elevators after hours and allows you into certain doors in our office .
 if we lose one of these ,  i think it &apos;s a $30 replacement fee .
 something like that .
 so if these were just badges that they had made up somewhere ,  i could see them charging a fee to replace them ,  but just to get them back from lost and found ?
 kinda reaching that point .
 for so long ,  i put off burning a bridge i needed to burn because i was still on it .
 took me an embarrassingly long time to realize i &apos;ll never get off it by crossing it ,  the other side is a dead end .
 so now i &apos;m building a metaphorical life raft and getting ready to blow the bridge up .
 i &apos;m building said metaphorical raft out of the metaphorical bridge ,  so i just gotta be careful not to collapse said bridge until my raft is done .
 but then i &apos;m burning this bridge and everyone else on it ,  and rushing away on tides of .
 okay ,  i &apos;ve run out of allegory .
 tl;dr while ideally you don &apos;t burn a bridge until you &apos;re off of it ,  that is something you can do if you need to .
 i understand that .
 a bad priest refused to baptize me as a child because my parents weren &apos;t married in a catholic church and he considered me a bastard .
 it &apos;s the reason my father is no longer catholic .
 in my opinion ,  a child is a child .
 you can &apos;t make a decision to dedicated yourself to a faith until you &apos;re old enough to understand what it means .
 and a lot of protestants would agree with me .
 ergo ,  a baby can &apos;t be any religion because they can &apos;t understand what it means much less whether or not they should dedicate themselves to service to god .
 we should do our best to teach and guide a child until they &apos;re old enough to make a decision for themselves .
 it &apos;s way too ingrained in some people .
 my stepdad will absolutely cut people off mid sentence ,  and he &apos;ll do so by being louder than them .
 he &apos;s a super nice guy ,  so this is a surprising personality trait .
 i started dealing with it by ignoring him if somebody else is still talking ,  looking intently at the person he cut off .
 i &apos;ll divert my attention when i &apos;m ready to listen to you .
 i only just noticed this ,  which is funny because i &apos;ve been around him for maybe 27 years if my life .
 let &apos;s see if it changes anything .
 i doubt it ,  though ,  since he &apos;s 70 .
 hahah thank you .
 well i don &apos;t remember every detail but it took her a moment to grasp the situation ,  the whole class went silent .
 she then sent me to the headmaster (while staying relatively calm iirc) .
 even tho i got bullied ,  i was lucky to have the headmaster on my side .
 it wasn &apos;t the first time i got sent to her because i tried defending myself .
 apparently i was able to speak well and have decent arguments so in the end she usually said something like  &apos;stay the way you are ,  you &apos;ve done nothing wrong &apos; and sent me  back .
 i got a pencil shoved into my hand by a bully; still have the lead on my left hand between my middle and ring finger under the skin .
 this same kid bit me on my arm until i bled ,  in 10th grade .
 teacher literally did nothing and told me to go get a bandaid .
 went right to the principal instead and blew up on the teacher .
 i was screaming in might have rabies now’ and shit .
 got sent home and was told not to come back the next day while we sorted it out .
 came in and this piece of shit accused me of bullying him and that he was defending himself by stabbing me and biting me .
 yup the 10th grade ap bio kid was bullying the 11th grade wrestler who had a record of bullying .
 took an other day off school for them to sort it .
 this is one of a few reasons why i became a teacher .
 i got bullies for a long time ,  7-8 years ,  got to grade 8 and was like fuck it ,  i just scratched anyone that bothered me with a sharp ass full metal pen ,  it lasted a few weeks ,  then people realised that theirs no way they could get me to stop ,  not the best approach but it worked
 i think that was one of the charges that was dropped ,  but still hilarious that they threw it in there to begin with .
  as a someone from a similar background but not quite the same .
  someone else did it for me .
 i was in this situation at this age ,  and my fast-food “not a real job” job gave me a little over minimum wage ,  had room for advancement ,  gave me almost 40 hours a week ,  had a really flexible and accommodating schedule ,  and gave me access to a lot of decent food .
  i worked at the two places closest to my tiny studio apartment ,  easily scheduled work around my school schedule ,  and used my discount to take home loads of orange juice ,  milk ,  and all the unsold salads i could ever want .
 my family was embarrassed that i had a fast food job at 19 instead of working 20 hours a week for minimum wage as a receptionist at a dental office .
 if they can do it safely ,  they &apos;ll turn it into a large training exercise and call in a bunch of companies to take turns .
 grew up in an apostolic pentacostal  &apos;community .
  &apos; when someone needed to be avoided because they were  &apos;not of the body &apos; it meant that they weren &apos;t  &apos;true believers &apos;/not in the church/not one with the body of christ .
 most likely something very similar to that .
 first line of this guy &apos;s uc berkeley app: please help me i &apos;m trying to escape a cult
 what are ties and climb on ties in this context ?
 i &apos;m still in contact with my mom and brother ,  who both got out .
 i stay in contact with a couple of the other girls ,  who also got out ,  but it &apos;s mostly superficial facebook  &apos;staying in contact .
  &apos; two of the women died ,  and one is still with michael ,  along with some of the children ,  who are now adults in their 30 &apos;s .
 hopefully not ,  that place sounds like something out of a horror movie or some shit
 the hardest thing to adjust to was realizing how much completely illogical bullshit i had just swallowed whole .
 for several years i was constantly realizing how irrational some of the things i believed were .
 i knew michael was full of shit .
 but i didn &apos;t realize how much of it i had never stopped to think about .
 i had to overthrow my whole entire belief system ,  not just in terms of spirituality (or lack thereof) ,  but also morality ,  my sense of self .
 he taught us the most absurd shit about the role of women ,  and i still catch myself feeling ashamed just for being female sometimes .
 but that is much less often these days .
 my thought ,  she was the actual angel .
 two of the women died .
 one of the women and some of the children (now in their 30 &apos;s) are still there .
 all of us who did get out did everything we could to help the others who wanted to leave ,  but some just wouldn &apos;t go .
 am in media and entertainment here ,  the first thing you learn is that being nice actually gets you further in your career than being a dick .
 why do you think most marvel movie personnel rarely change ?
 they run a fucking tight ship and if you cause problems ,  you &apos;re out of there no questions allowed .
 it &apos;s more than that ,  though .
 in entertainment most people who are every expletive that fits the personality to the staff almost never stay in the spotlight for long .
 why would you want someone who is a known problem on set to be on your set ?
 it &apos;s getting better ,  but there &apos;s still some bullshit in the department .
 the professor i mentioned earlier didn &apos;t have his contract renewed and ,  as far as i &apos;ve heard ,  his replacement is a decent dude .
 the playwriting professor is now the head of the department and i think he &apos;ll do great because he never bought into the favoritism .
 there &apos;s still some that are cliquey ,  though .
 it would still probably be best to seek out other programs for now ,  though .
 if you &apos;re the asshole eventually someone who cares about you snaps and tells you .
 that &apos;s what happened to me .
 it was brutal and wonderful as it laid out clearly what parts of me i needed to change to be successful at what i wanted to be doing .
 exactly the previous commenter’s point though ,  we may be getting a biased viewpoint on his friend group so we can’t be too quick to judge or assume .
 although unlikely ,  i do think that op should expand a little more while we assume a supportive/neutral standpoint (even though this is reddit where you’re supposed to automatically trust the commenter/poster unless someone with more awards disagrees with them)
 op was a part of a friend group that ghosted them basically .
 op believed they were a part of the friend group .
 we get one perspective .
 i think it &apos;s more likely that it was just a case of  &apos;not at school anymore ,  don &apos;t really care anymore &apos; kind of thing toward op ,  but it &apos;s also possible op was blowing up group chats trying to get them to spend time with op when really they were just tolerating op during school for the most part .
 hell ,  per op:  &apos;i wasn &apos;t exactly part of their group ,  but they seemed to enjoy my company .
 single pane of glass ,  digital transformation ,  actionable analytics ,  hyperautomation ,  pushing it to the edge ,  cloud first strategy .
 i get so fucking tired of hearing this shit .
 and not enough keys .
 i want to know about the key stakeholders ,  the key initiatives and objectives ,  and the key outcomes we’re striving for .
 sorry i enjoy my anonymity .
 given his post history and evident racism (he tried to prove the superiority of a certain race by stating how aborigines were still so uncivilized when europeans made it to australia ,  despite having so much time to get civilized on their own) ,  it &apos;s highly doubtful he wrote anything at all ,  let alone be a successful novelist .
 guy spends too much time on reddit being a useless idiot .
 also his whole story has nothing to do with wanting to  &apos;burn down the village &apos; .
 i don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s getting upvoted .
 /u/songsoflightanddark - care to address ?
 or too busy being racist to be bothered ?
 i went to med school and they did the same if we needed our badge back .
 reminds me of leaving a toxic relationship safely
 no authority figure can say it outright but yeah many times a short spike of violence is worth years of fruitless  &apos;ignore them and they &apos;ll go away &apos;
 i work in a supermarket .
 one day my nan asked me when i was going to get  &apos;a real job in an office &apos; .
 i ignored her but i like my job ,  the hours work for me and my partner ,  we &apos;re not on benefits and we pay our bills .
 it really shouldn &apos;t matter what job people do as long as they &apos;re making an effort to earn their own money ,  especially when it &apos;s young people starting out .
 ah ,  that makes a lot of sense .
 that would be a cool thing to watch from a safe distance .
 fucking cults man .
 i think he meant clip on ties
 this is quite shocking to me as i grew up here in india idealizing the west ,  and believed that they are not superstitious and blind in faith at all .
 it sounds like how the plot of far cry 5 might have begun
 would you consider doing an ama ?
 i am so glad you got out !
 i understand having to go through overhauling your belief system/religion/spirituality ,  as i had to do the same .
 i love this quote from jamie lee finch: “i lost god to gain myself .
 i’ll lose you to keep her if i have to .
 ” also found her book really helpful: you are your own: a reckoning with the religious trauma of evangelical christianity .
 all the luck on your new path !
 that’s unfortunate for those who died .
 i hope you’re doing a lot better by this point .
 i am intrigued by your story !
 did you ever feel the obligation to report this place as a cult ?
 actually not even sure if there are there even legal ramifications for this sort of things that “michael” is doing ?
 see terrence howard for a prime example of that .
 this is almost exactly what happened to me in my college &apos;s theater department .
 our department was small and i was really the only tech focused student ,  which was cool because i got hands on experience with lights ,  sound ,  set construction ,  scene shop management ,  technical directing and even budgeting a show .
 unfortunately i was also an outcast because of it .
 the students would have cast parties which ,  more often than not ,  was an  &apos;everyone except mr .
 other tech students came and went from time to time .
 i suspect they dipped because they were tired of being left out and unappreciated ,  which is what i should have done in hindsight .
 eventually it all came to a head when we were doing a production and the set designer wanted a box set .
 we had a crew of 3 people that worked 10 hours a week and 5 weeks to build .
 long story short ,  i stayed in the theater alone until 3am for weeks to finish it and barely got it done on time (we finished painting an hour before opening night) .
 that night we had a respondent from kcactf give feedback and he basically said he hated the set and since i was the technical director i took the brunt of the fault .
 i basically told him we were short handed and just ran out of time so some things just couldn &apos;t get fixed .
 this girl ,  in the middle of me explaining our difficulties ,  interrupted me and said ,   &apos;we had a paint call ,  so it wasn &apos;t just you and the two others working on the set ,  we had time .
  &apos; i couldn &apos;t believe after all of that work someone would just throw me under the bus like that .
 it sucked and i ended up dropping out before finishing my degree because after that my mental health tanked bad and i was very suicidal .
 honestly i wish i had bailed on them and transferred schools .
 it would have been hard but at least i would have been (hopefully) working with people who would at the very least appreciate the work i put into the program .
 i &apos;m glad your program is improving ,  and you &apos;re doing better ,  if it gets bad again don &apos;t be afraid to leave ,  take another break ,  transfer ,  or whatever you have to do .
 childish cliques aren &apos;t worth your mental well being .
 your right ,  op sells us on their perspective and it shows nothing of the actual situation .
 i actually glossed over that point so this does very well seem like that kind of friendship ,  where it &apos;s actually acquaintances .
 you the guy that wrote the bible
 good luck with the move !
 in that case i hope the book isn &apos;t called  &apos;songs of light and dark &apos; lol
 not necessarily toxic ,  not a relationship .
 just realizing nothing i can do will make my father happy .
 i spent so long thinking i could just satisfy him enough to get out and do my own thing .
 only to realize that it &apos;s never gonna happen .
 he &apos;ll never be happy anyway ,  so i just gotta get out and do my own thing .
 i &apos;m trying to be careful about how i do it ,  because homelessness is hard to dig yourself back out of .
 so to change metaphors ,  or maybe mix them a little ,  burning this bridge isn &apos;t gonna drop me in a river ,  it &apos;s dropping me in a canyon ,  aka a big hole in the ground .
 i can &apos;t avoid being in this hole ,  but i give myself as many resources as possible to dig myself back out of it ,  and try to drop onto as shallow ground as possible until then .
 i might also be stretching this metaphor a little too far .
 mightve almost been expelled twice ,  and nearly got my eye clawed at .
 (that being said ,  there &apos;s a chance the assholes start picking on you to show other people how  &apos;crazy &apos; the person who retaliated is .
 (because of course ,  they &apos;re  &apos;crazy &apos; for not wanting to get picked on any more/s .
 it’s really fun actually .
 we did this with my great aunts house and ended up roasting marshmallows once it burned down enough
 i take it you’ve never tried to climb a tie
 there &apos;s superstitious and blind-in-faith people everywhere ,  even in the u .
  there &apos;s always going to be people who seek to control other people and religion is a very good way to manipulate the ignorant .
 oh boy wait til ya hear about utah .
 scared ,  lonely ,  gullible people will exist no matter where you go .
 no ,  there are many religious movements in the west that mislead people into giving up lots of time and (especially) money .
 one especially disgusting example are churches who believe in a  &apos;prosperity theology &apos; ,  or  &apos;the prosperity gospel &apos; .
 basically ,  they convince people that they will become rich if they donate to their church ,  or that god will reward them if they give up their money to their church .
 of course ,  nothing happens ,  unless by pure chance ,  and the people who give up their money are left worse off than they were .
 another one that is more mainstream yet still suspicious to me is charismatic christianity ,  or pentecostalism .
 these people believe their faith in god grants them powers ,  like ability to speak in other languages (look this up ,  its hilarious ,  sad ,  and kinda creepy watching these people speak actual gibberish) the ability to heal themselves and others ,  the ability to do miracles and prophesize the future .
 misleading at best ,  deceptive at worst .
 if you can convince people they can talk to angels when they flail their arms around and say a bunch of gobbledegook ,  what else can you convince them to do ?
 i knew a couple who went to a pentecostal church who had convinced them to pay a tithe (10 percent of their income !
 ) honestly ,  it &apos;s just sad .
 i &apos;ve been quietly ignoring the ama requests ,  but people are still asking .
 but as far as i can recall ,  i &apos;ve talked about all this more on this post than i ever have with anyone but my husband ,  and they aren &apos;t the greatest memories .
 i trust you &apos;ll understand if i &apos;d rather let it go again for now .
 i wouldn &apos;t have known who to report it to ,  or how to go about it .
 i just tried to help others get out if they wanted to .
 the ones who are still there have had a lot of chances to leave and stay with one or another of us who left ,  but they have chosen to stay .
 or edward norton ,  or ike perlman (that one is particularly huge ,  he was one of the producers up until the end of phase 2) .
 the fuck is wrong with these people ?
 you never stiff the tech people ,  that &apos;s how you fuck over yoursefl !
 shit this dude is the bomb .
 that one story about the chick who turns to salt is crazy .
 i didn &apos;t google that looking for a book title .
 i dunno what you &apos;re talking about
 (that being said ,  there &apos;s a chance the assholes start picking on you to show other people how  &apos;crazy &apos; the person who retaliated is .
 unfortunately ,  that &apos;s what my bullies switched to and kept with for years in elementary school .
 it started in 3ed grade and hit its peak in 4th grade .
 in 5th grade ,  my teacher decided to place my desk on the opposite side of the room ,  away from everyone else .
 she kept that setup because she noticed that there were fewer  &apos;incidents &apos; .
 what she didn &apos;t understand was that my bullies didn &apos;t go after me as much because they succeeded in fully ostracizing me .
 this shit kept going until my family moved and i changed schools after 6th grade .
 after that ,  my bullies from elementary school then started getting in trouble for things like throwing staplers through windows because they didn &apos;t have anyone to pick on or a convenient scapegoat anymore .
 i have ,  actually .
 seven year old me decided it would be a great idea to tie all my dad &apos;s ties together into a rope and climb out of a second story window .
 seven year old me also sucked at tying knots ,  and fell from said window into a bush .
 some friends and i came across an flds escapee in utah while rock climbing and camping in the desert .
 her story sounded very similar to op’s but with lots of rape and forced miscarriages aka unsafe abortions .
 we believed her and assured her we’d take her with us back to california but she got scared and disappeared .
 i still wonder what happened to her and how many of these cults are out there getting away with this crap .
 your username just makes this comment sound creepy
 people in just about every field and context forget this .
 just look at how often the it department of a company gets thrown out and outsourced .
 member when those kids got eaten by bears ?
 why do all these cults have to ruin such a cool state ?
 we even have them in pennsylvania ,  theres this  &apos;church &apos; near me that a lot of friends from my old neighborhood now go to .
 a lot of them are typical cult members now ,  seeming nice on the surface until you mention religion and they flip out ,  saying that you are going to hell .
 there are like 2000 members ,  and most are pretty crazy .
 i know some who don &apos;t buy the propaganda ,  but are in with their family and won &apos;t admit that they are in a cult .
 oh ,  and they have a missionary group that gets into schools because a member is on the school board and harasses kids about jesus .
 i don &apos;t think they are physically abusing anyone ,  but the emotional control is there .
 spoiler alert dude ,  i only read when a guy played cast away with a couple hundred animals .
 dude cults are everywhere ruining all the states .
 we also have them in rural parts of california .
 i only found this out when i was dating a guy whose father started his own cult and tried to kidnap him and his siblings when their mom refused to join .
 literally anyone can start their own cult .
 all you need is some charisma and a crazy creation myth to make your religion sound special and different from the rest .

 my dad was getting on my case every day about  &apos;playing on the computer &apos; when i was checking job sites and going through their infuriating sites that make me upload my resume ,  then fill in fields that are on my resume three different times .

  &apos;ok boomer ,  how can i pay off my college debt ?
  &apos;you’re so lazy ,  i worked my way through college and paid for it myself !
 maybe if you didn &apos;t pursue that useless art degree ,  you wouldn’t be in debt !
 me: “ok boomer ,  how do i come out to my parents ?
 boomer: “you should ask jesus to forgive you instead !
  &apos;just throw it out the car window .

 uh this is so true .
  recently a boomer said to me  &apos;i &apos;m happy to keep burrying rubbish mate &apos; .
 oh my god if i had a nickel for every time my grandma would flat refuse to give an address because  &apos;i know where it is .
 it had that tree in front that got struck by lightening in  &apos;92 &apos;  .
  &apos;okay ,  so it &apos;s got a big dead tree in front ?
  &apos;oh no ,  the storm knocked it down .
 it &apos;s where it was &apos;
 fuck this drives me crazy .
 i use google maps damn near everywhere because it reroutes based on real time traffic .
 ride in the truck with my dad and he always takes his routes
 didn &apos;t work ,  couldn &apos;t get buzzed in through the security door .
  also the manager isn &apos;t on-site and works remote from another city .
  also they don &apos;t hire directly so you have to apply to the staffing agency first .
  also the position advertised through the staffing agency isn &apos;t really open because they &apos;ve already selected someone internally ,  and only posted it to meet regulations .
  &apos;and dress smartly !
 i mean with a suit and tie !
  &apos;ok boomer ,  how do i tie a tie ?
  &apos;what are you asking me for ?
 do you plan to rely on me for everything for the rest of your life ?
 you need to show more initiative and responsibility !
 it took a year of applying and having no luck before my dad realized that the internet doesn &apos;t make the whole process easier or more expedient .
 what &apos;s ironic is when i switched industries and it became the norm to physically go down the company and fill out an application .
 gotta say ,  kinda wish you could go down to some place you want to work at and actually talk to someone .
  this was my dad &apos;s real advice for me when i was an unemployed 22 year old .
  he also told me that if i get rejected to just keep showing up every day until the boss sees how  &apos;hungry &apos; i am .
 this is the nicest boomer reply just cause he said kiddo
 whereas a boomer would absolutely be irate if you turned off the tv during the weather forecast .
 always quickly followed up with ,  “oh !
 i know how to use computers ,  i knew how before anybody else did .
 i’m not dumb you know .
 as accusatory as possible for absolutely no reason when you’ve fixed the problem in under 2 minutes .
 i can totally get fucked and keep an aspirin between my knees
 oh i always heard it was a nickel between the knees .
 i just realized i have neither aspirin nor nickels on hand .
 well ,  guess i &apos;m getting pregnant despite my tubal .
 my mother has said this since i divorced my first husband .
 everytime i introduced her to someone new .
 i &apos;ve actually never heard that phrase in my life .
 is that really a thing ?
 and only fox qualifies as  &apos;the news &apos; .
  &apos;back in my day ,  we didn &apos;t even have weather &apos;
 you gotta window ?
  &apos;when are you going to start finishing inside our daughter ?
 my aunt every time i visit .
 i just bought a brand  new miata ,  a 2 door sports car .
 i think that says everything about me wanting to have kids without having to .
 don &apos;t sit so close to the tv ,  it will ruin your eyesight .
 for real though ,  i had a professor who was a bit hard of hearing and would sometimes have to ask students to speak up when asking questions .
  she says that she didn &apos;t actually lose her hearing ,  because she knows exactly where she left it -- on the dance floor of her favorite nightclub in manhattan .
 i once got in an online debate with my uncle about this very subject .
 his argument was that he worked a minimum wage job to put himself through college and support his family ,  so we youngsters should quit complaining .
 to prove my point ,  i calculated how many hours it would take at current minimum wage just to pay current tuition at his alma mater ,  and it was over 100 hours per week .
 he was so angry that a year and a half later he still had the date of that argument memorized and cited it as an example of my disrespectful attitude .
 your great uncle set up a table in the park and repaired bicycles one summer when he wanted money for college .
  after college he got a job at the lab equipment factory by giving the manager a firm handshake and bought a house in the city at age 23 .
  i guess you kids just have other priorities these days .
 just work part time at the local factory !
 i did that during summers and had enough for college tuition ,  plus enough left over at the end to afford a house !
  &apos;ok boomer ,  what &apos;s a check ?
  &apos;a check is how you pay for groceries in the express lane &apos;
  &apos;just work a part time job !
 i saw a post i think on here once that was a form from decades back at harvard where an option was to pay tuition with cash .
 my dad &apos;s problem is more that he &apos;s way too fucking slow .
 i &apos;ve literally seen an exchange that went something like this when he wanted alexa to play  &apos;man on the silver mountain &apos; by rainbow .
 alexa: starts listening .
 dad: massive pause as he realises he doesn &apos;t actually know what he wants to ask her .
 alexa:  &apos;sorry ,  i didn &apos;t catch that &apos; .
 alexa: starts listening .
 alexa:  &apos;sorry ,  i didn &apos;t catch that &apos; .
 dad:  &apos;alexa ,  shut the fuck up and listen for a sec &apos; .
 alexa:  &apos;sorry ,  i don &apos;t understand &apos; .
 alexa: starts listening .
 alexa: starts searching for  &apos;man &apos; .
 alexa:  &apos;sorry ,  i couldn &apos;t find that in your library &apos;
 my grandma has full on conversations with siri .
  what is the name of the museum in maryland that is getting written up in the- &apos; .
 siri:  &apos;here is a list of museums in maryland .
 grandma:  &apos;-washington post .
  what did she just say ?
  siri ,  what did you say ?
  i can &apos;t stand this woman .
 siri:  &apos;do you want to see articles from the washington post ?
 grandma:  &apos;no i would not .
  i would like to know the name of the museum that was written up there .
 grandma:  &apos;oh for heavens sake how to you talk to this batty woman ?
 lol this is legit my mom
 now that &apos;s not what i call music volume 12 !
 na the boomer answer would be  .
 time for you to get a watch
 in a similar vein ,  a boomer that works in my office for some reason was talking about checks ,  and then smugly asked me if i even knew how to write one or if i owned any .
 like damn ,  i &apos;m getting talked down to because i don &apos;t own or use an incredibly outdated payment method ?
 why don &apos;t i just start carrying around golden nuggets and weigh the proper amount at the grocery store
 you forgot to add “it’s past darlene johnson’s house ,  you know darlene her son is john he’s the doctor” (literally no clue who these people are) .
 this is so painfully true .
 i ask for the name and general vacinity of a place just to look it up on google maps ,  and instead get a 10 minute explanation from 3 different people about how to get to someplace that &apos;s easily accessible and 10 minutes away .
 in a world without clocks ,  one restaurant seeks to restore order .

 obligatory “thanks for the silver” edit !

 my mom told me when i was 26 ,  “i was married and had a house when i was your age .
 how much student loan debt did you have !
  &apos;do you even know how to use a card catalog ?
  &apos;why does it matter ?
 probably just a bunch of rubble at this point .
 they &apos;ve been fighting for thousands of years ,  there &apos;s nothing that will stop them .
  &apos;ok boomer ,  what &apos;s the capital of iraq ?
  &apos;well it should be washington dc !
 the nearest cracker barrel is only 28 .

 young folks these days ,  don &apos;t even know what &apos;s going on in your heads .
 in my day ,  our therapist was your granddad &apos;s belt .
 if we were caught sulking ,  dad would whoop it out of us .
 if you saw the neighbor kid getting whooped in the front yard ,  you just assumed he did something to deserve it .
 in my place it actually goes like this .
 me -  &apos;can i please get into counseling or get a therapist ?
 boomers -  &apos;have you tried praying and asking for god to help you ?
 or ,  alternatively ,  not being sad ?
 why don’t you just choose to be happy ?
 that part is very uncharacteristic of boomers .

 you keep bitching about not being able to find a job ,  but i don &apos;t see you out there pounding the pavement and knocking on doors .
 the immigrant boomer edition rants about how back in their day ,  people wouldn &apos;t even look at their resume because they &apos;re brown and have an ethnic name and that you should be grateful that there &apos;s apparently no more hiring discrimination .
 maybe that rant will extend to how you should be grateful that you don &apos;t need to worry about racist landlords anymore ,  or that you don &apos;t get beaten up for you race or religion .
 the rant ends with them telling you that you need to get a good job because they did not cross an ocean for you to be a freeloader .

 hey ,  thats no boomer !

  &apos;i &apos;ll give you a ride earlier ,  traffic on 294 is a nightmare ,  they still have all that construction .
 how many years has it been ?
 i took your sister last week and we spent 20 minutes in a dead stop .
 damn semis everywhere too you really oughta be careful .
 and security at the airport is gonna be hell this time of year ,  best leave 8 hours early .
 actually ,  this one doesn &apos;t sound that bad
 i’ve learned the hard way about missing flights or just barely making it in time with loads of anxiety .
 obvs this is an exaggeration but i totally would appreciate an ai assistant that tells me to wake up at 8am instead of 9
 i &apos;m a millennial .
 that made me anxious just thinking about setting an alarm 1 .
 5 hours before a flight .
 aside from the distance to the airport thing ,  i need to be at an airport as early as possible for fear of the flight leaving early or customs taking hours lol .
  &apos;have you tried not being poor ?

 and get a full pension which was closed to new entrants in 1985
 he had one (1) job in his entire life ,  and retired with a pension that pays 90% of his final wage ,  adjusted for inflation ,  for life .
 his work place was unionized ,  obviously ,  which is why it had such incredible pay and benefits ,  but he fucking hated the union with all his soul for costing him like $100 per year in union dues .
 by the way he didn &apos;t even apply for this job .
 instead ,  his college had employers come in to woo students directly ,  and he chose the company that one of his friends was already at .
  &apos;okay cosby ,  please shut down for 3 to 10 years .
 you &apos;re going back in the box &apos;
 lazy millennials can &apos;t even be bothered to finish their jokes .
 my (silent generation) parents always told me to “look it up in the dictionary .
 ” so i just learned how to infer the meaning of words through context ,  sure showed them !
 i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the real ok ,  boomer answer to that question .
  their answer would be more like: .
  &apos;you need to go to college .
  it doesn &apos;t matter how much it costs ,  just get loans .
  &apos;ok ,  boomer ,  i &apos;ve got my degree and so much debt i can barely afford to survive .
 what do i do now ?
  &apos;you shouldn &apos;t have taken on so much debt for a useless degree .
 just walk in ,  ask to speak to the guy in charge ,  then give him a firm handshake while you look him straight in the eye and tell him you want the job .
 that sounds more like a silent generation response .
 wait don’t boomers and older all have like little box of index cards with recipes on them
 came here to see if it was happening for anyone else .
 holy shit that &apos;s terrible
 i laughed way to hard at this !
 i used to be a courier running rural routes .
 ended up in this podunk town trying to find a rural routes address .
 these are post office addresses ,  not street addresses ,  and the post office would not tell us where the house was located because we were the competition .
 i stopped at the only store/gas station in town ( &apos;town &apos; was this store ,  a feed/hardware store ,  and a bar) .
 every one stops what they &apos;re doing and turns to look at me when i walk in .
 this town is nowhere near a highway ,  they don &apos;t get many out of town visitors .
 i ask where so and so at this address lives .
 the cashier stared at me for the longest time ,  then tells me to take the road west out of town for so many miles and take a right at the old johnson barn ,  then down another mile on the left .
 i ask what color the barn is ,  she tells me the barn is gone ,  i &apos;m supposed to take a right where the old johnson barn used to be .
 we were in a whole different state and the person (boomer) driving wanted to go to a restaurant she had been to once two+ years ago and she insisted that my google maps and my friend &apos;s apple maps were wrong and continued getting us more lost .
 she kept saying  &apos;i remember it was near the library and then you have to turn onto the interstate &apos; .
 when i got my drivers license ,  i was all  &apos;i &apos;m not going to stick to the traditional routes ,  i know more than 1 way home &apos;   .
 turns out the traditional routes were always the fastest .
 here and there though .
 i could take a back road home .
  &apos;i know how to get to the airport quickly !
 it only takes an hour !
  &apos;dad ,  google maps suggested a route that only needs 45 minutes .
 i &apos;ve known the route for 20 years .
 i know better than some internet .
 needs 1 and a half hour
 you:  &apos;ok boomer ,  it didn &apos;t work ,  couldn &apos;t get buzzed in through the security door .
  also the manager isn &apos;t on-site and works remote from another city .
  also they don &apos;t hire directly so you have to apply to the staffing agency first .
  also the position advertised through the staffing agency isn &apos;t really open because they &apos;ve already selected someone internally ,  and only posted it to meet regulations .
 ok boomer: &apos; you are just making excuses .
 they &apos;re not really hiring ,  they &apos;re just surveying the market to see what they could have and for what price .
 sometimes ,  they &apos;ll even interview people in person and not hire anyone .
  &apos;dad ,  can you come over and show me how to fix the water pump ?
  &apos;my god your generation is useless .
  &apos;well how did you learn to fix a pump ?
  &apos;my dad showed me .
 this one actually got to me a little bit .
 honestly i crave any human contact in the interview process
 that &apos;s a good way to get banned from a company

 i just get my kids to do it ,  here ,  i &apos;ll give them the phone and you can talk to them while i go back to reading the newspaper &apos;
 i have the reverse conversation with my dad half the time computers pop up .
 he &apos;ll claim he doesn &apos;t know how computers work ,  and i have to remind him that he &apos;s been using them for longer than i &apos;ve been alive .
 boomers ain’t heard of doggy style ?
 we were taught ,  it &apos;s a wedding band .
 it’s another way of saying keep your legs closed ,  aka abstinence .
 the idea is that an aspirin or coin are all small that need to keep your legs close together really tight to actually hold it .
 jeopardy is my jam .
  i’ll win it one day ,  just you wait .
  you don’t understand ,  i don’t just answer the questions ,  i answer them in the proper format .
  whenever i have guests over to watch with me ,  they sometimes answer quicker because they don’t use the format ,  but i score the points because i do use the format .
  jeopardy is more than just a game ,  it’s my ticket out of applebees .
  it’s so swamped here that i served a man cold ribs last week .
  i’m beyond whelmed ,  i’m overwhelmed .
  it’s okay ,  soon i’ll have my shot in sunny los angeles with alex trebek himself ,  he’ll see the spark in my soul .
  he’ll see the fire in my guts and the blood in my eyes ,  i’ve been training my clicking thumb you know .
  my response times are improving ,  down to  .
 23 seconds on average .
  every night after my shift ,  i hit wikipedia .
  it’s the most efficient means of acquiring knowledge ,  and knowledge i do have .
  this year will be mine ,  this is my year .
  jeopardy will never have seen a winner like me before ,  this is my calling and my destiny .
 jeopardy and trebek are levels above wheel and sajak .
  the latter could be canceled and i wouldn &apos;t even care aside from having something to bring up to talk about with my parents .
 walked down the driveway to school in the snow

 im dreading my family coming to mine for christmas this year because of this reason .
 it &apos;ll be even worse this time around as we recently brought a dog .
 or as they like to call it ,  a  &apos;practice child &apos; .
 instead of answering i just ask them when they are going to do something i &apos;ve done .
   &apos;when are you going to europe on vacation aunt karen ?
  &apos;when are you getting a college degree ?
 then tell her to just ask her own children for grandkids .
 your children won’t be your aunts grandchildren ,  unless you’re from alabama of course .
 millenial: proves a point using math .
 boomer: stop disrespecting me .
 well ,  at least his anger proves you right .
 not like my mom ,  when confronted with maths and facts ,  she goes  &apos;you cant belive everything you read online ,  your facts are wrong &apos;   .
 \cries in multiple sources\
 i love when you prove someone wrong so decisively they have no rebuttal but the typical boomer  &apos;don &apos;t disrespect me .
 that &apos;s only 14 hours a day .
  you only need 8 hours to sleep and 1 or 2 to eat ,  so you should be good .
 so he has made it a point to remember exactly when he was proven entirely wrong  ?
 these days you would probably get a citation for operating without a business license .
 i guess you kids just have other priorities these days .
  they &apos;re called  &apos;eating &apos; and  &apos;shelter &apos; .
 steve jobs said he called people like the head of development for hp and asked for spare parts ,  no one ever refused to take his call .
  when he was just some dude working in his garage .
  hp even gave him a job in the factory .
 i don &apos;t speak mandarin .
 lol most factories nowadays require you to work 40 hours plus overtime .
  how do i get a job ?
  &apos;just walk in and talk to the manager .
 wow ,  this is eerily accurate .
 wait until you have 3 kids asking her questions all at once
 i have a speech impediment .
 this is my everyday with my gf &apos;s alexa .
 me:  alexa ,  t-turn on lights .
 alexa:  i &apos;m sorry ,  i don &apos;t understand .
 me: fuck you alexa .
 tbf ,  i &apos;ve had almost this exact same exchange with my alexa .
 but i fuckin knew it was mostly my fault ,  and i just gave up until i figured out what i actually wanted .
 to be fair siri is fucking terrible ,  at least compared to alexa .
 i swear siri hasn’t improved a bit in the last 5 years .

 that &apos;s a dad answer .
 not just limited to a certain generation .
 oh my god ,  this drives me insane .
 the most mundane question sets off a 15 minute history of the population of your hometown .
  &apos;hey ,  dad ,  where did you go this afternoon ?
  &apos;well ,  you remember john wright ?
 he &apos;s big jim &apos;s daddy .
 you know big jim ,  he used to work at the gas station right by delmar &apos;s .
 well ,  it used to be delmar &apos;s ,  now it &apos;s a sears .
 but big jim was jason &apos;s brother .
 jason who &apos;s sister &apos;s daughter was that boy in your class &apos;s mom .
 the boy who got in trouble when he robbed that feed store .
 anyway ,  john wanted me to look at some land he wants to buy .
 it &apos;s down right next to margaret shore &apos;s old house .
 you know margaret .
 he lost me at john wright ,  and the guy who robbed the feed store was in my sister &apos;s class ,  who is 10 years my senior .
  look ,  i understand the sentiment from a lot of replies saying ,   &apos;he just wants to talk to you ,  he loves you ,  have empathy &apos; and all ,  and i agree with that sentiment in general .
 but please trust that i know my dad ,  and that is not the place where this rambling is coming from in his case .
 this hits to close to home .
 i &apos;m visiting home for thanksgiving and my mom sent me instructions to somewhere like that .
 i asked my dad and he sent me a screenshot of the location on maps with a pin dropped .
 all i wanted was the name of the damn place .
 all the explanations are different too ,  you end up making the people trying to explain to you where to go usually end up arguing
 and this is why i ask  &apos;what &apos;s your street address ?
  &apos; rather than  &apos;where do you live ?
 on the flip side ,  there &apos;s the times when someone asks you how to get somewhere ,  and you give them an exact address and tell them to input it into google maps ,  and they reply with something like  &apos;google what ?
 in hindsight ,  maybe that &apos;s why they &apos;re asking for directions .
 that or they &apos;re out of battery or cell service .
 if someone asks me for a place ,  the way i do it is to just tell them the name along with approx time ,  distance and direction .
  &apos;where &apos;s the closest hospital ?
  &apos;there &apos;s a st thomas hospital roughly five minutes away .
 it &apos;s around 1km east from here .
 now pick any road  that goes roughly east and after five minutes you should be close enough that you can ask someone else for exactly where it is .
 or you can fuck all that and use what i said to look it up on google maps and verify that it &apos;s the right place with the rest of what i said .
 you should be good whether or not you use your phone to navigate .
 fuck people who tell you to take the third left after a brothel and then the eighth right after narnia .
 there appears to be some confusion here .
 when i say east ,  i don &apos;t mean literally verbally east .
 in real life i probably know which direction so i &apos;ll just physically point to that direction with my hand (which in my example happens to be east) ,  but i guess when you &apos;re typing out a reddit comment ,  you don &apos;t think of communicating such a nuance properly .
 this is the best doctor who spinoff yet
 time horton &apos;s and the cruller of eternity
 my dad gives detailed directions for places that aren &apos;t part of the route .
 he &apos;s like ,   &apos;you know when you take a right from here and then there &apos;s a lane with a mcdonald &apos;s on the corner ,  then when you go further in there &apos;s a small coffeeshop next to a grocery store ,  and just a little further inside is that odd little house with the pink windows ?
  &apos;so what you want to do is ignore that lane completely ,  and keep heading down the main road &apos; .
 then why give me all those details .
 thank you all for the stories !
 i keep poking fun at him giving directions and we both laugh about it ,  so i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll enjoy hearing all the similar anecdotes from your folks as well !
 i actually prefer that method .
 cardinal directions aren &apos;t dependent on what direction you &apos;re coming from like left and right are .
 it &apos;s easy to determine the cardinal directions where i live ,  but i suppose in an area with no obvious landmarks or no way to see the path of the sun ,  you &apos;d have trouble .
 my parents love to give me shortcuts to shave a couple minutes off a drive ,  when i &apos;d rather just go straight down the highway and maybe deal with a little traffic .
 i live in a big city now ,  i can deal with suburban traffic .
  &apos;karishma &apos;s favorite sitdown restaurant &apos; is an awesome tagline for applebee &apos;s .
 may this meme never die
 i cannot imagine the bullshit you must have to put up with on a daily basis .
 you &apos;re a fucking legend .
 my dad knocked up my mom right before he deployed for his first year in the military .
 thus ,  they lived on base housing .
 no rent ,  utilities ,  etc .
 they basically paid for food and stuff to keep us kids entertained .
 my mom worked ,  but that’s because my dad is very stingy with his money .
 her and my dad all the time: “well when i was your age i had two kids ,  i lived out on my own ,  and i was paying for all of my own stuff !
 no student loan debt .
 no heavy expenses .
 of course ,  when i point this out to them ,  they tell me that i should have gone into the military .
 i fucking hate the military .
 edit to add: thats a lot of upvotes and i’m nervous y’all  .
 having said this ,  please be respectful to people who are actively serving or who have retired from serving our country !
 while they chose a life path i disagree with ,  they do not deserve hate .
 we’re all just good little beans trying to make it in this crazy world .
 have a wonderful day ,  you beautiful creatures !
  &apos;well now you &apos;re 55 and you &apos;ve still just got the one house and the one husband .
 you get lazy or something ?
 and not to be sexist ,  but did your dad have a well paying job ?
 did she even have a job ?
 “okay boomer ,  what’s a card catalog ?
 my parents ,  prime boomers ,  drove from tennessee to washington state .
 they routed to as many cracker barrel’s as possible .
 they’re confused and sad that there isn’t a single one within driving distance of seattle .
 they also insisted on driving an hour north of seattle to go to wal mart for some random shit that was readily available nearby .
 they’re categorically insane .
 i actually just realized i &apos;ve lost 25 lbs in 3 months and the only change was cutting out eating out
 i bought an avocado toast ornament at michael’s this year .
 gonna hang it up in my house that i own .
 suck on that ,  boomer babies !
 boomers love chain restaurants .
 my hometown facebook news page is full of people complaining about another dollar store or urgent care opening up .
  &apos;we don &apos;t need another dollar store !
 how about a wendy &apos;s ,  applebees ,  or taco bell !
 “or if you’re fine with it bubba gump just opened”
 i hate it when older people tell me i speak too quietly .
 i &apos;ll speak up ,  obviously ,  but when it gets to the point that it &apos;s literally hurting my throat to speak loud enough for them to hear ,  that &apos;s not me being too quiet ,  that &apos;s them refusing to acknowledge their own hearing loss ,  and then taking out their frustration on someone who cannot refuse to interact with them .
 had a lady at work last week harass a fellow coworker for this .
 even after she heard her ,  she would not stop tearing into this literal teenager over her volume .
 i heard her ,  and i was twice as far away .
 the lady &apos;s husband ,  about the same age as her ,  and as far from my coworker as me ,  heard my coworker ,  and kept trying to make his rude wife shut up .
 i felt bad for the husband ,  he looked so embarrassed that his wife was harassing this child .
 best part was when the lady noticed that one of her pennies was  &apos;rare &apos; ,  spouting off how she was going to sell it and be rich ,  as if we all should feel bad now for telling her to leave the teenager alone ,  based on her potential fortune .
 it was a shield penny from 2015 ,  and wasn &apos;t abnormal at all .
 i enjoyed showing her more shield pennies from the drawer ,  while she watched with a permanent glare ,  and a fading light in her eyes .
 harass my precious teenaged coworkers and i will crush your dreams .
 or give their info to the  &apos;nice saudi prince who wants to give me an inheritance  &apos;
 the fact that boomers don &apos;t understand the meaning of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps never ceases to agrivate me
 it never seizes to amaze how much these assholes like to normalize and even glorify child abuse .
 the beatings will continue until morale improves
 my answer to that will always be  &apos;yeah ,  god provided a professional to help me .
  &apos; they don &apos;t know how to respond and it &apos;s kinda funny .
 how the fuck is cyber bullying real ?
 just turn off the screen and walk away
 ok boomer ,  execute order 66
 watching a video clip about mae jemison ,  a black/asian astronaut who served as a mission specialist on endeavor .
 boomer:  &apos;well obviously they don &apos;t let her drive the shuttle .
  she wouldn &apos;t know if she should steal it or crash it .
 who loves going home for the holidays ?
 instructions unclear ,  bootstraps pulled all the way up to ears .
 for straight people if you had to choose between being gay or giving up brunch what would you do ?
 in before heterosexuality is not a choice .
 i honestly wish this was more like it used to be .
  i applied for dozens of jobs ,  and the only thing i got contacted on were the places that are really shit jobs with high turnover and the 2 places i knew people .
 this one i feel .
 i work retail management and i don &apos;t know how many times i &apos;ve had some kid come into the store with thier overbearing parent and ask to talk to me about getting hired .
 they seem to think i have all this free time to chat with them about how great thier kid is like i &apos;m not already trying to do 3 things at once .
 and then you tell them we actually do not accept paper applications or resumes and that they have to do all of that online and they become personally offended .
 and inevitably thier kid says  &apos;i told you so .
 i’ve never seen this shoe .
  i sort of like it .
  oh god am i pre-boomopausal ?
 well of course i would ,  he &apos;s me
 don &apos;t worry ,  i &apos;m also an older millennial and i thought ,   &apos;boomer &apos;s got a point there .
 yeah ,  if you get up (not even leave the house) at 9am for a 10:30 flight ,  you &apos;re basically begging for a bad surprise .
 my parents are older boomers ,  and they still have the belief that people will give you money just for having a degree
 i feel attacked .
 and cuter than 99% of these
 like hell youre going to get my secret recipes !
 that &apos;s an old rodney dangerfield stand-up bit ,  almost word for word .
 i just had a horrible thought .
 what if i become the oldman that &apos;s getting everybody lost with google maps while my grandkids are insisting on using some new shit .
  &apos;come on grandad ,  the chiral network sayz you shoulda turn back there &apos;
 ugh literally the very response i get from my mother and grandmother .
 give me his number .
 because apparently you ,  also ,  are useless .
 the one that makes me want to burn the world down is when they inject their help into a situation where it was wholly unneeded ,  you tell them you &apos;ve got it ,  and they then act like you have no idea what you &apos;re doing .
 ignoring the fact that were that true ,  huge issues would &apos;ve arose before now .
 i never changed the oil in this car i &apos;ve had for going on 20 years .
  &apos; then they get pissed that you called out their stupid comment and  say something like ,   &apos;well you aren &apos;t the one who did it .
  &apos; to which you give a rough explanation of the process .
  &apos;park the car on something like a loft or use a jack to gain access to the oil plug ,  give a that a minute to drain and once it slows down take off the oil filter ,  put a ring of oil around the oil filter ,  replace the oil plug ,  and then put in the new oil .
  &apos;oh you think you &apos;re so smart .
 you didnt say to take the clear wrapper off the oil filter first .
 imagines what the going time on patricide is
 this whole chain is giving me flashbacks to when i was younger and the conversations i &apos;d have with my dad .
  &apos;you are so lazy .
 what are you gonna do when i &apos;m dead ?
 the council will get back to you with a verdict
 the  &apos;switch them on &apos; thing is so bizarre .
  they have a power button like every other piece of consumer electronics in history .
  on modern systems it &apos;s often the only button on the damn case .
 my mother taught me dos as a kid .
 i work in it and systems admin .
 i &apos;ve lost count of how many times i &apos;ve wanted to bash my head into a desk .
 all these people who say they don &apos;t know computers because they are too old yet they have dealt with computers regularly at work for decades now .
 its like they just decided to stop learning when they hit the age i am at now except i &apos;m exactly the opposite and love learning now more than ever .
 the same goes for music .
  so many of them stopped discovering new music 30 years ago .
 you &apos;re supposed to be doing it face-to-face through a hole in the sheet !
 on side or legs in the air are also options too !
 especially the former
  &apos;but what if i still don &apos;t want kids after i &apos;m married ?
 uphill both ways !
 the earth is not the same .
 as forests burn in fire and flame ,    .
 and great reserves of ice at sea   .
 are not the things they used to be .
 where species die ,    .
 and oceans rise ,    .
 and climates climb to soaring highs ,    .
 and all that is and was before   .
 will come to end ,    .
 will be no more .
 we have to change -   .
 we have to fight .
 i &apos;ve looked outside .
 it seems all right .
 my cousin told me if you do it standing up then you’re not have a baby ,  he’s had tons of sex so i don’t think this would be what a boomer would want .
 you apparently have never spent a second in /r/childfree .
 when you get asked that more than a dozen times a year your responses can get pretty vulgar .
 i think i even have some in my post history a few months ago .
 it &apos;s a trope at this point but still hilarious and obnoxious when people ask .
 run out of the room crying .
 have so glare at them and follow you .
 enjoy a nice beverage and then go back and say that you don &apos;t want to talk about it .
 or deflect to siblings/cousins who aren &apos;t there .
  &apos;hey ,  brother is older than i am ,  ask him &apos; .
 i really don &apos;t like these questions .
 my go to is to just get jokingly graphic about sex until everyone around me is uncomfortable .
 then change the subject .
 just have the more emotional partner start crying and flee the room .
 look at the floor  &apos;we ,  um ,  we .
 we were going to tell everyone today ,  but .
 last week ,  it um ,  and it turns out we can &apos;t .
 so ,  thanks for asking .
 additional comments: wow this blew up .
 don &apos;t get me wrong i understand how emotionally traumatizing a miscarriage is .
 i also understand how emotionally traumatizing infertility is .
 i hope everyone actually did get a kick out of my comments here .
 i am certain i offended somebody .
 for that i apologize and will make a donation to an appropriate non-profit institution .
 here &apos;s your move - act like the dog is your real child .
 he/she &apos;s 17 and about to move out to college .
 you &apos;re not sure if you can handle it .
 then you start crying .
 when you &apos;re being disrespected by mathematics you know you &apos;re fucked
 exactly the kind of situation that  &apos;ok boomer &apos; is for .
 that &apos;s exactly why  &apos;ok boomer &apos; is trending as a reply .
  they &apos;re gonna be offended no matter how you disagree ,  why bother wasting your time with the math if they &apos;re just gonna ignore it anyways ?
 also mom: goes and believes everything she reads on facebook .
 that &apos;s why we invented  &apos;okay boomer &apos; .
 around 97% of topics with my dad are like that ,  that i no longer bothered by him .
 nah forget setting time aside for school .
 that &apos;s the whole reason youre working ?
 save up like i did when i started working at 12 shoveling snow !
 boomers like barriers to entry to protect themselves .
 also boomers; why don &apos;t you guys just start a business and become wealthy like us ?
 and yet the entirety of the 15 years i have done electronic repairs ,  his company has refused to sell parts .
 or even send parts for a warranty repair .
 then it &apos;s even more rude of him ,  that i &apos;ve been trying to reach him for years ,  but he &apos;s never picking up .
 after my nephews learned how i turn on the living room lights with alexa ,  they started shouting at it to turn them on ,  off ,  on ,  off ,  on ,  off .
 eventually alexa said something along the lines of ,   &apos;it seems you &apos;re having a dispute &apos; and stopped responding .
 the kids were confused .
 i thought it was hilarious .
 my son asked alexa to play old town road .
 alexa: here are some facts about saudi arabia
 siri also only ever uses yelp when you look up restaurants or stores ,  i assume because apple made a deal with them .
 i don’t want to be tethered to yelp ,  which forces me to download their app to read reviews on mobile .
 it’s a huge loss of functionality and the hill i will die on in my hatred of apple .
 and alexa is terrible compared to the google assistant .
 i have an echo dot downstairs and a google home mini upstairs .
 alexa answers questions either wrong or not at all .
 so she ends up as a kitchen timer 99% of the time .
 i &apos;m pretty sure siri has actually gotten dumber than when she was first written .
 one time my mom facetimed me and swapped the camera so the whole call ,  all i could see was her feet .
  mom ,  don’t you think it’s weird that you’re looking at me on the screen and there’s a little movie about feet in the corner ?
  is the world so weird to you that this doesn’t register as a mistake of some kind ?
 it was hilarious .
 ps: she was born in 37 ,  so pre-boomer
 you can’t forget that loud ,  obnoxious cough .
 it &apos;s just one college tuition michael ,  what could it cost ?
  &apos;ok boomer ,  set a reminder for december 11th .
 doctors appointment at 10am .
  &apos;see that &apos;s the problem with you millennials .
 you &apos;re too dependent on smartphones for everything .
 why are you setting up a doctor &apos;s appointment anyway ?
 if you &apos;re not dying you don &apos;t need to go to the hospital .
 back in my day you don &apos;t go to the doctors when you feel sick .
 you do what real men do and tough it out .
 only sissy nancy boys go to the doctors for feeling sick .
 real men only go to the doctors when they have real problems like getting stabbed through the abdomen with a rusty bayonet from the vc or contracted syphilis from a saigon whore .
 i forgot to put quotation marks .
 and even worse if there &apos;s mention of a year ,  especially between an older couple  .
  &apos;howard ,  you know big jim &apos;s grand nephew .
 he was in high school around 1986 ,  or was it 1989 ?
  &apos;it &apos;s 1992 because that was the year the deli shut down &apos; .
  &apos;when was big jim &apos;s niece in high school ?
 she was dating that colored boy remember ?
 and the older they get ,  the more their frame of reference becomes stuff from when they were young .
 seniors will tell you about local gossip from 60 years ago and expect you to relate to it .
 lmao the screenshot .
 how on earth could he think that would help you ?
 tell them to mapquest it .
 third left after a brothel and then the eighth right after narnia .
 instructions unclear ,  ended up in neverland
 my dad is bad about saying stuff like: .
  &apos;you know that curve where random townsperson got killed in a wreck ?
 i don &apos;t even know who that is .
 so anyway ,  when you pass that .
 that sounds like like the time i caught the ferry to shelbyville .
 i needed a new heel for my shoe .
 so i decided to go to morganville ,  which is what they called shelbyville in those days .
 so i tied an onion to my belt ,  which was the style at the time .
 now ,  to take the ferry cost a nickel ,  and in those days ,  nickels had pictures of bumblebees on  &apos;em .
  &apos;gimme five bees for a quarter ,  &apos; you &apos;d say .
 now where were we .
 the important thing was that i had an onion on my belt ,  which was the style at the time .
 they didn &apos;t have any white onions ,  because of the war .
 the only thing you could get was those big yellow ones .
 they should invent some device that always points in some direction .
 probably have to use magnets or something .
 nobody knows what magnets are but they &apos;re basically magic so they should work .
 oh god my dad does this all the time !
 most of his directions involve cutting through some guys driveway ,  or some other thing .
 as long as karishma remains unproblematiclly iconic then it won &apos;t
 lol it’s really not much different than any other customer service job i’ve had but you can argue they’re all nightmares i guess .
 i live in a decently small town so most of our customers are locals who started eating here when it was the only sit down restaurant in town and know half the staff by name .
 i think that may attribute to them not being unbearable most of the time .
 i mean a lot of stuff is microwaved but it’s mostly just sides like broccoli and mashed potatoes that are prepared in the morning and then heated up before posting when you order .
 if you order a steak or burger it’s going to be made to order .
 how dare you choose a different life path for yourself .
 my dad was on the raf .
 i &apos;m often surprised to see how normal people react to the experience i had growing up in comparison .
 like ,  on some shitty tv reality thing there was a guy crying that he hadn &apos;t seen his kids in a week .
 i burst out saying  &apos;its only a week ,  so fucking what ?
 i was not popular in that room .
 both had high paying jobs actually that they had in the 80s and through into the 90s .
 jobs they stayed at for years and years .
 my mom was with the same company for 20 years and my dad just retired from his job that he was at for 44 years .
 they also own a lot of property ,  all rented out for extra income .
 you &apos;d know if you &apos;d ever been to the public library in 1974 .
 they probably have some kind of twitter email thing now .
 this sounds less like boomers specifically ,  and more like they &apos;re just unworldly southerners .
 cracker barrell used to give out free maps of the usa that had the location of every cracker barrell restaurant marked .
 i know that feeling .
 i used to eat out all the time in college and one day noticed how much i was spending on it .
 once i dropped that habit ,  not only did i lose weight but also i enjoyed the occasional going out way more than the constant eating out .
 wait ,  who let you buy a house ?
 i thought there were laws against such things for millennials .
 and if it is a dollar store ,  it &apos;s a goddamn dollar general where nothing is a dollar .
 fuck you ,  dollar general .
 oh man ,  we &apos;ve had so many good restaurants open in my area .
 we have multiple legit teriyaki and mexican places ,  some thai places ,  multiple good local burger joints ,  etc .
 what do you see from boomer reviews ?
  &apos;there are only 2 places to get decent food .
 the applebee &apos;s and the billy mchale &apos;s .
 what does it mean ?
 thanks for the definitions ,  i &apos;m clear on the meaning now .
  &apos;because i turned out fine !
 except when they think child abuse is okay ,  and even perpetuate it themselves as part of the cycle of inter-generational abuse ,  then nah ,  you didn &apos;t turn out okay .
 this is a good response for any sort of luddite religious silliness .
 god has provided the answer to this stupid problem you &apos;re having through modern technology .
 you &apos;re basically already rejecting his help ,  so like ,  what more do you want ?
 yep ,  i &apos;m a bible college drop out and i remember having to say this to people .
 oh ,  you &apos;re getting bullied on your computer ?
 can you pause it ?
 technically ,  if anh takes place in 1977 all of the clones (born 20-30 years earlier ,  in 1947-57) would be boomers ,  so you &apos;re not wrong .
  &apos;she &apos;s a doctor and a nasa-qualified engineer ,  jim .
 said by someone who dropped out of high school .
 be gay ,  do crimes .
 the correct way of phrasing that question is: .
 for straight people if you had to choose between being gay or giving up brunch what would you do order for brunch ?
 i have a fucking masters degree and i can &apos;t find a fucking job .
 i wish i could just go into the office and hand in my resume .
 these things are like the old man shoe of choice in australia .
 dunno how popular they are in other countries
 what &apos;s better: freaking out about missing your flight due to traffic ,  long security lines ,  undermanned check-in counters ,  etc .
 and barely squeezing onto the plane as they &apos;re about to close the doors .
 getting day drunk stress free for an hour and a half before your flight starts boarding
 cantankerous though they may be ,  they are still our ancestors ,  and time has granted them a share of ancestral wisdom: airports suck .
  &apos;these wifi printers aren &apos;t reliable ,  you should just buy the ticket from a travel agent .
 i &apos;ll give you a phone number to call and you can fax her the details .
 did you try a good work ethic and a positive mental attitude ?
 you basically can cover a mortgage payment on those two things alone .
 he must have lived somewhere in the rural midwest ,  because that &apos;s the norm here in michigan .
 anywhere north of grand rapids/lansing ,  i .
  &apos;up north &apos; ,  and it &apos;s all rural routes and small towns .
 google will buy chiral far before it becomes a worthy competitor ,  so don &apos;t worry zoomer .
 keep on keepin &apos; on .
 i can &apos;t fucking stand people who don &apos;t know the difference between a  &apos;reason &apos; and an  &apos;excuse &apos; .
 they just assume you &apos;re a raging idiot that hasn &apos;t thought out the problem at all .
 they want you to accept their  &apos;solution &apos; that they &apos;ve given 2 seconds of their life to come up with and then get mad that their stupid answer isn &apos;t received as a genius life altering solution you could never have come up with on your own .
  &apos;ok boomer ,  i pushed my way past security and demanded to speak to their hiring agent .
 i was arrested and now have a felony .
 i can no longer get hired anywhere due to my felony ,  but i &apos;m still $46 , 000 in debt from my college degree .
 what are my options ?
 yeah he dead tho
 “youtube ,  and maybe i’ll find a decent parent on there too .
 we find the defendant guilty .
 portable glory hole ?
  &apos;and how do you think that hole got there ?
 repetition because my generation knows what it means to be persistent .
  &apos;who &apos;s going to work the farm ?
  why hire out ,  when you can have kids ?
 barefoot ,  on broken glass .
 everytime i see sprog i wonder what their gender is ,  but i dont want to find out and just picture them as a green onion in a cup of water
 sadly it wont stop there at least with my family .
 nosey fuckers will dig into it even more if you do that ,  just more sneakily .
 each one of them will find you when youre alone and start a super serious conversation because theyre  &apos;deeply concerned &apos; etc .
 well i’ve been creampieing your daughter every night for the past 4 months but nothings happened ,  got any tips ?
  &apos;when are you going to get kids ?
  &apos;probably never ,  we &apos;re just way too much into anal .
 that should stop any more questions .
 lmao i like that .
 make it real graphic and low key vile to really throw em off: .
  &apos;actually she calls me daddy every time i &apos;m coming on her face so we &apos;re one step closer !
  &apos;yeah ,  doctor said we &apos;ve been doing it in the wrong hole ,  but we &apos;re gonna keep trying it for now !
 boomer minds would explode
 i &apos;ve plowed your daughter from every position imaginable ,  in every room .
 we &apos;re up all hours of the night ,  sometimes we go at it after brunch .
 hell i had her upside down like a wheel borrow moments before you came to visit .
 what can i say though ,  no matter what we try ,  nothing seems to stick .
 well that &apos;s not entirely true .
 i did this (for real ,  it wasn’t pretending) and what happened next was my parents checking i knew how to have sex .
 in the end however ,  they paid tens of thousands to have us do multiple attempts at ivf ,  all of which failed and made us miserable and depressed for about five years .
 deliciously evil but im a terrible actor and wouldnt be able to keep it up then i would feel bad for doing that to my nan .
 the pushy rudeness doesn &apos;t end with that .
 they &apos;ll 100% know a fantastic fertility doctor ,  personally of course or at least enough to continuously get you bombarded with options and never letting you forget they &apos;re only trying to help you with your problems .
 just an fyi this doesn &apos;t always work .
 we don &apos;t really want kids anyways ,  but my mil would love for us to .
 we told her there &apos;s about a 70% chance i can &apos;t have them and she still tries to shove the idea down our throats .
 not through the adoption route though ,  through fertility treatments (the thing that caused my older sister to have a half dozen miscarriages this year) .
 it &apos;s not something we would ever consider after what we saw my sister go through .
 plus we still don &apos;t really want them !
 i told her she &apos;s getting grand dogs and she almost cried .
 minus 1 that &apos;s 3 .
 x was fine ,  stop complaining  .
 x is wrong now though .
 x was fine when i was a y .
 x is different now here is maths to prove it .
 your attitude is disrepectful you snowflake .
 you fell right in to my trap .
 i activate ok boomer .
 your life points are 0 and i banish you to the old folks realm .
 yup ,  pretty much !
 wikipedia is bad and everyone can edit it .
 but facebook is a failsafe source of wisdom !
 i always knew memes would save us in the end
 reminds me of mitt romney back when he was campaigning: .
  &apos;just get a $20 , 000 loan and start a business &apos; .
 sure senator romney ,  it &apos;s just that easy to be self employed you bain capital business liquidating horse &apos;s ass !
 apple is horrible when it comes to that ,  if they had their way all apple products would be disposable
 man i have some bad news for you
 for some reason both variants are incredibly frustrating for me to imagine .
 somebody in the alexa development department definitely has multiple kids .
 one of the many reasons i went with google: it &apos;s plugged straight into google .
 that ,  and they skyway already read my email ,  know my calendar ,  and where i go everyday .
 might as well keep it in the family ,  rather than invite amazon to join the party as well .
 you can &apos;t even look at the pictures for a place without it trying to install the yelp app .
 forces me to download their app  .
 and that is why i stopped using yelp all together .
 the second i realized i could not go to their shitty website without downloading their app is the second i started avoiding them completely .
 google reviews is enough for me .
  &apos;alexa ,  set timer for 10 minutes .
 ten minutes later:  &apos;beep beep boop boop &apos; .
 my home mini had a conversation with walter from  &apos;fringe &apos; yesterday ,  i was making dinner & watching fringe ,  and walter said something then off goes google giving him the answers .
 to be fair ,  i imagine she &apos;s learned to block out all the extraneous ads we &apos;re bombarded with .
 probably just thought it was some orthopedic ad and ignored it .
 mine was born in 1934 .
 she was intelligent ,  but somehow couldn &apos;t get the hang of using her echo .
 she also wondered why  &apos;people are putting all this stuff on my facebook !
 i don &apos;t know them .
  &apos; she was looking at her friends &apos; timelines ,  with posts from their friends .
 and a sneeze that causes a 9 .
 8 richter earthquake .
 boomers love to go to the hospital .
 car in the driveway ?
 they are big old pussies .
 in my day ,  we dropped dead of a massive coronary in our mid fifties and we liked it !
 i don &apos;t know who you dad is ,  but i really need to hang out with him .
 depends on how zoomed in it was .
 if i recognized a place on the map and knew how to get there ,  it could be really helpful .
 in one indian megalopolis (i think it was mumbai) there &apos;s a food delivery company that hires illiterate delivery staff that is not guaranteed to be literate ,  so they &apos;ve developed their own little pidgin improvised script which is not meant in a condescending or colonialist way to denigrate people of south asian extraction to direct each driver which gigantic building to go to and which parcels of food to drop off .
 apparently it &apos;s legendary for its effectiveness .
 so much so that western researchers have started studying it to see how it &apos;s significant in learning and language formation although i don &apos;t have a source for this part and apologize if you have incurred any economic burden due to overreliance on this statement .
 the service not only delivers take out food ,  but more challenging still ,  it delivers parcels from an office worker &apos;s family (usually his wife) to his office place so he has something to eat for lunch .
 edited due to copious user feedback .
 i &apos;m now deactivating inbox notifications for this comment - the true sign that a comment has really made it in reddit &apos;s user consciousness .
 further  somebody gilded this message over a month after it was posted .
 the minds of redditors are strange places .
 i can’t wrap my head around there being only one sit down restaurant in town and it being an applebee’s
 and they fucking wonder why we can &apos;t buy houses for our damn selves .
 they &apos;re all being rented .
 my mom &apos;s gen x but has lived her whole life in rural rural (and very poor) texas .
 anytime she &apos;s visited me or is otherwise in a more  &apos;city &apos; like area this is exactly how she behaves .
  it &apos;s funny and annoying at the same time but also a comfort zone thing i try to have more patience for .
 i don &apos;t think it &apos;s even southerners specifically ,  (other than op &apos;s parents being southern) .
 i &apos;ve had people from michigan come to chicago ,  where we have some amazing food ,  and insist on finding an olive garden .
 hell ,  even some friends born here in the burbs can &apos;t get out of their comfort zones .
 he downloaded you fucking out of touch boomer
 if i &apos;m not mistaken ,  its supposed to be a joke or like purposely poor advice ,  as pulling yourself up by your bootstraps would achieve basically nothing in most scenarios ,  even figuratively as you wouldn &apos;t get very far .
 it was bassicly meant to say something was impossible ,  as pulling yourself up by your bootstraps is impossible
 its like the joke about how one day a town begins to flood ,  a lot of people get evacuated but the town vicar gets trapped on his roof as the water level keeps rising .
 the vicar prays to god to save him .
 later on a couple of local residents in a dinghy spot the vicar and shout for him to jump down and get into their boat .
 the vicar looks at the water and denies ,  saying  &apos;it &apos;s alright ,  god will save me .
  &apos; so the dinghy moves on .
 later a rescue boat comes by looking for stranded people and they spot the vicar and ask him to jump to their boat but he refuses ,  saying  &apos;god will save me &apos; so the boat moves on .
 finally the water has risen so much that the vicar &apos;s ankles are under .
 suddenly a rescue helicopter flies above and drops their ladder .
 but the vicar denies them as well .
  &apos;go save the others first ,  god will save me &apos; .
 eventually the water rises and the vicar drowns .
 when he opens his eyes he &apos;s stood at the pearly gates of heaven and god is before him .
 the vicar angrily points ,   &apos;my lord i prayed all day in your name ,  why did you not save me ?
 god stares him down and says  &apos;i sent you two boats and a helicopter ,  what more do you fuckin want ?
 and to top it all off ,  in my first interview the hr guy tried asking me technical questions and said that if it weren &apos;t for my friend &apos;s recommendation he wouldn &apos;t have passed me to the next round of interviews .
 the reason he thought i didn &apos;t know enough for the job is because he didn &apos;t have a clue about what he was asking .
  i was trying to be polite and give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he knew more than i did ,  but no ,  he was just an idiot with my future in his hands .
  my buddy was pissed and reamed him out for asking things he doesn &apos;t know the answer to .
 seriously good luck ,  it &apos;s shitty out there .
 f i r m    h a n d s h a k e
 the way he phrased it in his act was  .
  &apos;now you just keep goin &apos; straight down this road here ,  and then make a left where the old schoolhouse used to be .
 i often wonder if google have developed an ai to see how much of a threat a new company is and whether they should buy it or not
 and they &apos;ll bring up the friend &apos;s son ,  who &apos;s do much better and successful than you are
 and then the one in a million happens and their way works .
  &apos;see ,  i told you i was right .
 “oh ,  you always have an answer everything” .
 because i’ve thought about this problem ,  because it directly affects me .
 because ,  what you’ve said doesn’t really make sense .
 because you’re not giving me advice ,  you’re trying to impose your specific way of thinking onto me without giving me any autonomy .
 because you’re giving me completely unsolicited advice because you feel the need to microbiana my life ,  so i have to either come up with bullshit answers so you stop assign the same things over again ,  or you’ve caught me doing something not exactly the way you would do it so i’ve got to either blow off your advice or give you a reason .
 “oh ,  you drive too fast .
 oh ,  you drive to dangerously .
 you need to go the speed limit .
 i’m sorry ,  but all of the information i’ve read on the issues tells me i need to go with the flow of traffic because that is the safest way to drive .
 if everybody is doing 75 in a 60 ,  that means i should be doing something similar ,  and if people are doing 40 in a 50 ,  i need to accommodate that .
 it’s not “being safe” when you travel 5 under the speed limit the entire way from jax to orlando ,  adding between 30-45 minutes of travel time ,  just because you don’t think i would have made the trip .
 there have been more than a handful of things that i been told don’t need to be done ,  and i go ahead and do them anyways and ,  behold ,  it was actually good idea and everybody else ends up doing it the same way i did .
 i’m sorry that i grew up in a different time .
 it’s not that the advice is bad ,  and i’d listen to it if it was relevant ,  but ,  so many times it’s just like “no ,  that’s literally not how anything works these days .
 you don’t just walk into a place and ask for a job anymore .
 something something boot straps
 and yet somehow still more useful .
 well that was quick
 climbing barbed wire fences
 i &apos;ve always pictured sprog as frog ,  from  &apos;frog and toad are friends &apos; .
 don &apos;t know why ,  but that just now dawned on me .
 i just assume sprog is a sentient ai that &apos;s chosen to use its awareness to bring joy to an otherwise disheartening reality .
 wow i just found my gender identity .
 give every one of them a different stoey about why and then let them try to sort it out without looking like they &apos;re gossiping !
 i &apos;ve seen an answer that did something like answered  &apos;not gonna get a child yet &apos; every time while stating that with every question asked ,  the time for getting one is pushed to a later date .
 i feel like that is misspelled but neither creampying or creampiing look right either .
 good to meet you sir ,  by the way my dick basically lives inside your daughter .
  &apos;been fillin &apos;  &apos;er up to the lungs  &apos;n &apos; hangin &apos;  &apos;er by the ankles ,  honest .
 not evil at all .
 it &apos;s honestly more evil to try to pressure people into making a life decision that costs them enormous amounts of time and money .
 if people don &apos;t want kids there nothing wrong with that .
 the last thing this planet needs is more people .
 them &apos;s fightin &apos; words !
 quick maffs ftfy
 i banish you to the green oaks assisted living community .
 that 20k wouldn &apos;t be enough to get all the prerequisites in place these days
 you mean fruit doesn &apos;t cure cancer ?
 i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s so difficult about it .
 prepare a sentence that conveys what you want (play man on the moon) ,  and simply say it .
 perhaps a little bit slower and/or clearer than normal .
 how can it be so difficult for grown people to literally talk ?
 if you need a few tries to get the hang of it i understand ,  but there are so many people who never learns .
 i wish my parents were savvy enough to tell the difference .
 it used to be that ads were relegated to a specific ,  non-intrusive space on a website .
 i would occasionally look at them to see if they were of interest .
 then advertisers started making the ads more intrusive so they covered content ,  moved around the screen ,  auto-played with loud audio ,  etc .
 my brain got more defensive and essentially developed an ad-block so that i don’t even “see” the ads now .
 of course now advertisers are disguising ads as the content itself .
 the article you’re reading is actually the advertisement ,  i .
 sometimes there’s even additional ads on top of the ad article !
 my brain is already adapting to filter out the sponsored content links based on subtle visual cues and specific language in the title .
 i’m terrified of whatever the next iteration will be .
 it’s a goddam arms race !
 ah yes ,  the dad sneeze™ .
 the dogs yelp in fear .
 the house shakes off its foundation .
 the windows blow out .
 all the wildlife in the surrounding woodlands flees; birds flock from the trees and the deer and foxes scamper away .
 what about _baby crying on your flight_ ?
 watch out ,  he contracted syphilis from a saigon whore ,  you don &apos;t want to mess around with him
 wouldn &apos;t be as helpful as dropping the pin and then pressing the share button to send the actual pin location ,  though
 you &apos;re talking about the mumbai dabbawalas .
 they &apos;re not illiterate ,  but they do have their own system of delivering the  &apos;dabbas &apos; - the tiffin boxes from homes to offices and this system is so effective that they have a 99 .
  &apos;the dabbawalas constitute a lunchbox delivery and return system  that delivers hot lunches from homes and restaurants to people at work  in india ,  especially in mumbai .
 the lunchboxes are picked up in the late  morning ,  delivered predominantly using bicycles and railway trains ,  and  returned empty in the afternoon .
 lunch boxes are marked in several ways: .
 abbreviations for collection points .
 colour code for starting station .
 number for destination station .
 markings for handling dabbawala at destination ,  building and floor .
 a colour-coding system identifies the destination and recipient .
 i saw a show once that described a service where people left their lunch in their fridge and the delivery service got it and heated it up and brought it to them at work
 just don &apos;t forget to print it out before you leave .
 the next town over from where my husband and i live has such low registration rates at their elementary schools ,  they’re shuttling kids in from our town .
 turns out ,  the next town over is too pricey for people in their 20s & 30s and is inhabited mostly by boomers who aren’t dying (thank you modern medicine) and aren’t selling their houses .
 when houses do go on the market there ,  they cost too much for people our age who have kids .
 thus ,  no kids in that town to attend the elementary schools .
 i live in hawaii and local people are obsessed with olive garden .
 like they cant visit the mainland without finding one .
 that and trader joes .
 there would be riots if one opened on oahu .
 you wouldn &apos;t download a house
 sorry ,  i don &apos;t listen to hip hop .
 a key piece of information is that bootstraps are straps on high boots ,  like cowboy boots ,  to help you put them on .
 now imagine standing in your boots ,  and pulling on them ,  expecting to just levitate into the air .
  &apos;you know back in my day  &apos;gay &apos; didn &apos;t mean a queer !
 this is the same thing !
 goddamn millennials twisting words like they own them !
 i had a phone interview today and the guy asked me how can you tell an email is not legit or contains a virus .
 and i said ,  well ,  for the average user ,  you can &apos;t .
 most people would look at an email address and assume that &apos;s where it &apos;s coming from because while spoofing emails isn &apos;t that common ,  if someone &apos;s spear phishing ,  they can make it look convincing .
 and he said ,  no ,  i &apos;m asking how you tell if an email isn &apos;t legit or has a virus .
 what steps would you take to determine if an email is safe .
 and i said ,  if i had to dig further to find out whether an email is legit ,  i would have to look at the email header and determine whether the information there matches with the domain dns .
 maybe there &apos;s a dkim key .
 maybe the mx record points to one server and the email was received from another .
 there are many other factors we can use ,  for example call the sender on your phone and see if they sent you something if it doesn &apos;t sound like an email they normally send you .
 and then he said ,  no ,  that &apos;s not what we &apos;re looking for .
 why didn &apos;t you just do a virus scan on the computer ?
 that tells you right away if there &apos;s a virus .
 i &apos;m at a total loss of words .
 i forgot that not opening email attachments from suspicious sources isn &apos;t the default thing that people do .
 i just decided to go back to community college for an architecture & engineering design program (just cad and math pretty much) at 22 after working in restaurants for a while ,  thinking itll be way better quality of life and it will pay off ,  but i am fucking struggling with the world of academia honestly .
 hearing this sort of stuff makes me wonder if i &apos;m just gonna end up chained to the kitchen forever .
 always worried asking wtf i should do .
 i hate to admit it ,  but my husband says i &apos;m starting to get like this .
 lol i drove professionally for years and know my way around the area better than most .
 he &apos;s from another state but has been here for 20 years .
 when we drive anywhere i &apos;ll share information about the area and a lot of that is about what used to be there .
 i &apos;m becoming my dad !
 google deepmind buys competition automatically
 yep ,  me and my old man ,  right down to the co-worker &apos;s more successful son .
 gee dad ,  maybe that more successful son had a lot more support earlier in his life and didn &apos;t grow up with a father who is a belligerent bigoted hillbilly and by all metrics a loser himself .
 i swear it’s uncanny how this shit happens .
 like when my wife and i got a dog her parents were on us about how much responsibility it was going to be and how much training it was going to take to get her house broken and blah blah blah .
 i’ve had dogs before ,  i know what i’m doing and i don’t need advice from two people who have never owned nor trained a dog in their life .
 and our dog was great .
 didn’t take long at all to get her potty trained and she was really good about telling us when she needed to go outside .
 then my wife’s parents came to visit for the first time since we got the dog .
 she promptly went under the dining room table and pooped .
 like wtf ,  of all the times to do that for the first time .
 her parents were just talking out of their asses about shit they know nothing about ,  yet they still get to say “i told you so” .
 no don &apos;t listen to that guy .
 he doesn &apos;t even work here and he &apos;s drinking at 10:38 .
 what a disgrace .
 the verdict will be posted tommorow .
 through 6 feet of snow !
 introduce a different verb to the sentence to address the plural noun: .
 well i &apos;ve been dumping creampies into your daughter every night for the past 4 months but nothings happened ,  got any tips ?
 just here to say ,  if you don’t have a car to get to said job ,  that 20k is half gone just to get out of your neighborhood .
 nope ,  the bad news is that essential oils actually cures cancer .
 holy shit ,  this is like the best description of a dad sneeze that i ever read ,  one time i was in a doctor &apos;s waiting room and some dude that looked to be around his 40s sneezed and i swear i heard my ears ring for like 3 minutes .
 i’m so glad they added these by popular demand
 sharing an actual pin is way better than sharing a screenshot of a pin ,  but the screenshot is still better than a long winded explanation of landmarks along the way .
 i don’t understand the point of that .
 why not just bring it to work with you and heat it up there ?
 or am i missing something ?
 i mean ,  trader joe &apos;s i get .

 i flew to honolulu with a bunch of co-workers for a job in 2011 .
 those assholes insisted on eating every group meal at some stupid chain restaurant .
 cheesecake factory ,  cheeseburger in paradise ,  i passed on olive garden ,  and everything else i could get in a2 hour drive from my midwest home .
 they even decided the group would get starbucks on the way to work .
 i found a local place and pissed off the team lead by going there by myself every morning .
 the one good place we ate was duke &apos;s .
 its like that troll meme where you sit in a metal bucket and hold a magnet above your head to fly
  &apos;how do you pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you don &apos;t have any boots ?
 by far my favorite response to that phrase .
 i don &apos;t even know that guy and i actively dislike him .
 why don &apos;t you just do a virus scan .
 people like him are the reason we have to take annual cyber security training at work .
 oh my god ,  i &apos;m so sorry .
 this one hurts to read .
 most people don’t realize that the biggest thing that gets sent out in emails isn’t a virus or malware if any type .
 phishing emails are the most common way people get their data stolen .
 if you don’t know what to look for ,  or something seems off ,  don’t go clicking links and especially don’t go typing in usernames and passwords .
 as u/sparkism stated ,  checking dns records is really the only way to tell if an email came from a legitimate source ,  but even so if it seems off ,  be cautious going forward with anything .
 i never met my dad .
 i just had my mother admitted for threatening self harm and alcohol abuse .
 i’ve been the adult in the family for years .
 despite graduating college taking care of my mother ect i get compared to my high school drop out cousin who is now making big money because he followed his father into the elevator trade .
 change of plans ,  we’ve come to a verdict now .
 fought the huns on the way
 you can even use a thesaurus for the verb to get really wild with it: .
 injecting creampies ,  blasting creampies ,  shooting creampies ,  spilling creampies ,  spurting creampies ,  discharging creampies ,  and ,  my personal favorite: pouring creampies .
 some verbs you &apos;d need to rearrange things a bit because the subject of the verb is the daughter instead of the creampie: .
 flooding your daughter with creampies ,  distending your daughter / daughter &apos;s womb with creampies (poetic ,  don &apos;t you think !
 ) ,  supplying your daughter with creampies .
 the possibilities are endless !
 edited to appease creampie enthusiast
 i recently moved to north america and i just hate the public transit .
 its costly ,  unreliable ,  sparse ,  not well connected .
 granted i used to live in a mega city and current city even isn &apos;t close to that but this is a rapidly growing ,  rather dense ,  modern city .
 a 10 mins ride by car is almost an hour in bus plus the wait (15 mins for 2 hours ,  30 min off peak for a busy route) and not to mention buses are 30+ mins delayed .
 well technically once you die from the treatment you don’t have cancer anymore so you right
 what i saw the first time i read about the service is that the wife will stay home and cook the lunch that morning ,  then someone will come by and pick it up and deliver it .
 and construction workers/laborers don &apos;t always have access to storage or heating utilities on job site
 refrigerators and microwaves aren &apos;t really that common in india or in offices .
 why don &apos;t you just do a virus scan .
 ha ,  how about we educate our employees and don &apos;t let it get to a point where we use the virus scan as a clutch
 shall he be hanged ?
 what shall be his punishment ?
 math lessons on the back of a shovel ,  written with charcoal- my dad
 so anyway ,  i started blasting
 well guys i have honestly been slinging torrents of semen into your daughter &apos;s love cave daily but to be honest we &apos;ve not had any luck so far .
 we &apos;ve tried all sorts !
 double penetration ,  orgasm before and after ,  even steve got in on it !
 pouring is nice but i think we can do better .
 spunking or ejaculating or gushing .
 we need the verb to be as visual as possible ,  to give the listeners a sense of being in the moment .
 when i sneeze at work ,  my co-worker 4 rooms down from me send me an email with the subject  &apos;bless you !
 ha ,  how about we educate our employees .
 i hate to break this to you ,  but however much you  &apos;educate &apos; your employees there will still be dipshits that click on email attachments .
 the same punishment that most millennials must abide .
 crippling student loan debt .
 with all due haste .
 spunking and ejaculating are a bit boring in my opinion ,  one is clinical the other has been used as slang for far too long .
 gushing on the other hand ,  that might work ,  but it &apos;s a bit too literal i think ,  and makes one think of blood instead of semen .
 pouring is just so ridiculous that you can &apos;t help but imagine the guy using his dick as a tap to fill up their daughter .
 i talked to a flat-earther about my job working for a company that tracks ship locations ,  routes ,  and speeds by satellite .
 we also had ways of monitoring carbon emissions based on fuel consumption and known weather conditions .
 none of this would work at all if the earth was flat .
 not a jot of it .
 i could only explain the most basic concepts ,  but it was enough for him to understand and realise that i was right and that he’d been convinced by someone who had no practical experience of the spherical nature of the earth .
 i think that’s what really did it - my experience was really tangible .
 this happens then this happens then we measure this etc etc .
 no theory ,  just practice .
 a bit like showing a child a rock dropping to the ground in order to explain gravity ,  rather than giving them the whole theoretical shebang .
 sorry it’s a bit rambling i’m so damn tired
 the mobius strip earthers had more compelling arguments .
 kyrie irving hasn’t been doing press conferences
 quote i got from somewhere .
  &apos;for 5 years i believed the earth was flat ,  then i turned 6 &apos;
 look ,  it &apos;s really easy: .
 if the earth is flat ,  there would be an edge(s) .
 and there would be a fucking disney park at the edge ,  and we could bungie jump off the side and paraglide into the void etc etc .
 someone would be making an absolute shit ton of money off of it - if it existed .
 nobody is doing that - adn in this world where absolutely everything is exploited for profit - if no one is making money off of it - it does .
 i watched a documentary about flat earthers called “truth behind the curve” and my analysis from watching that these flat earthers are a group of people who found a community to be a part of .
 it’s a shame their community is based on a lie ,  but i saw a bunch of people who were to be part of a community .
 most of the people were social awkward and whatnot ,  and so an opportunity to be an influential figure within the community so they double down on their flawed logic .
 the more against you are of them ,  the harder they rep their flatness .
 tldr: i see flat earthers as a group of lonely people looking for a community that will accept them .
 wtf did not expect this comment to blow up .
 thanks for the silver ,  and the dialogue everyone .
 i was debating a flat earther in mexico ,  and i asked him about how gps worked if there were no satellites .
 he said that they had devices in the ground to route you .
 i told him the mexican government is barely able to put decent water pipes in the ground; would he really think they had the tech to put routing devices in the ground ?
 he chuckled with a thousand mile gaze .
 a serious answer here .
 the thing that made me stop was just the question  &apos;why would nasa lie to you &apos; .
 i will try replying to all of yall but will go to a study hall so ill reply later
 i spent about a year infiltrating the flat earth community on instagram .
 i garnered a decent following with an account dedicated to flat earth travel photos (an intentionally absurd premise) .
 in that time i learned a quite a bit about the community including how to discern the trolls from the real deal .
 the majority of legit flat earthers are extremely distrustful of anything the government says or does .
 these same people are 9/11 truthers ,  holocaust deniers ,  and anti-vaxxers and they connect these conspiracies together .
 many of them have also attached flat earth theory to religion ,  magic ,  or mysticism .
 before my infiltration i’d always considered conspiracies fun .
 like they were the fan fiction of real life .
 now they mostly make me sad .
 for all the phony accounts like mine ,  there are still plenty of people out there willing to drop a couple of hundred dollars on a flat earth convention .
 the inclined seat conformed perfectly to his body ,  strategically placed in the cockpit so he could reach no buttons with outstretched arms .
 the straps anchored him firmly in place ,  they were uncomfortable but necessary .
 the engine burst to life with a roar that burned out all the other audio ,  the vibrations tore through his body and he felt his body sink back into the seat as the g-force began to take hold .
 the captain was watching the readouts on the led displays and monitoring their trajectory as the acceleration began to peel his thoughts away ,  there was no more room in his brain ,  it had been filled by pure fear .
 the boosters grew with greater ferocity as they lifted higher into the sky ,  the sun beaming down on the left side of the shuttle .
 but faster they went .
 through max q and higher into the stratosphere until the engines grew quieter ,  the air more silent ,  and the vibrations became less violent .
 they were approaching space ,  the final frontier .
 an hour later ,  and with the path of the shuttle a success he noticed as his raw emotions withdrew that his body felt funny ,  head hair drifted aimlessly across his eyes as the captains pen hovered in mid air and he knew the impossible was true ,  his childhood dream ,  he was in space .
 the captain turned around to him ,  and motioned him to unhook his seatbelts .
 he did as he was commanded .
 they both left their chairs and glided over to the tiny glass windows to overlook the magnificence of earth .
  &apos;what do you think now ,  &apos; said the captain .
 he recoiled in horror ,  it couldn &apos;t be .
 nasa had replaced the windows with high definition screens in order to perpetrate their lies that the world was spherical .
 had to travel to japan ,  gave up on my beliefs in order to make a shorter trip .
 not a flat earther .
 but i was a 9-11  &apos;truther &apos; i guess you could say--insofar as i thought it was an inside job .
 i was heavily influenced and believed in multiple conspiracies in the zeitgeist film as well .
 there was a never ending source of dark ,  shadowy  &apos;they &apos;s and them &apos;s &apos; controlling everything behind the scenes .
 i think there were a few factors that helped me escape that: .
 losing my father .
 it was such a life changing event at that age that it made me reconsider everything in my life .
 some light training in evaluating information .
 i learned about how to vet sources ,  primary ,  whether something was actually news or just an opinion/editorial ,  etc .
 ironically ,  this education came before i was duped .
 after my dad died ,  suddenly this started to kick in more .
 lack of time/means to dig myself a deeper hole .
 i started college shortly after my father passed and that + a full time job took up all my time .
 i had none to buy further into the newest crazy bullshit .
 i had no facebook/twitter/ig/etc .
 no smart phone or texting .
 my primary use of reddit once i discovered it was for r/naruto ,  r/bleach ,  rage comics ,  and advice animals .
 so all in all ,  i think the time away gave me time to detox .
 if i had been on social media as i discovered those things ,  i can only imagine i very well may have become a q believer as well .
 looking back i see how gullible i was in that moment ,  fooled by the onslaught of half truths and clever  &apos;logic &apos; of the various theories .
 i know better now (and i should have known better then) ,  but i &apos;ve been humbled to the fact that everyone is vulnerable to this sort of stuff .
 to think otherwise is deluding yourself .
 our government couldn’t even keep bill clinton’s oval office blowjob a secret .
 you really think they can keep something that big a secret ?
 i was tired of living life on the edge .
 not me ,  but got a flat earther to question his beliefs (and hopefully critically analyze them) by giving him the proof he asked for ,  to which he responded  &apos;mainstream science and media are lies &apos; .
 i asked why he asked for proof if he could just disregard it as lies either way ,  then told him that since he required no proof (or evidence against) to believe something ,  it made him the easiest person to decieve and that it seemed pretty sheep-like to me .
 he deleted all of his flat earth comments and hasn &apos;t posted about it since .
 eta: holy round earth ,  batman !
 thank you for the karma and awards and gooooold !
 i promise i &apos;ll screenshot next time !
 eta2: he didn &apos;t block me ,  i can still see everything he posts/posted ,  and the op thread creator also said the comment disappeared .
 facts and logic .
 more specifically star patterns .
 what we observe can not happen on a flat earth .
 so no one with serious responses .
 i was kinda looking forward to reading the replies
 no one took me sphereiously
 i feel into a rabbit hole of conspiracies .
 thankfully ,  physics is a mandatory subject in switzerland ,  made much more sense that any « top 10 facts that prove that the earth is flat » .
 my fil is a flat earther and all around nutcase .
 i asked him if the earth was flat and you was right ,  what then ?
 how is your life any different ?
 his face was priceless because he didn’t have an answer .
 did any of you former flat earthers just believed because you wanted to be  &apos;unique &apos; and different from everyone else ?
 i suspect that some people who deny shit like this are the same people who just wants to be different .
 they &apos;ll say they disliked a movie because the majority likes it .
 they &apos;ll say they don &apos;t enjoy a type of food coz most do .
 they don &apos;t really care how they truly feel about something .
 they just want to be different and say the opposite of the majority .
 maybe not with everything .
 but they &apos;ll choose a few things in life because they want to feel special .
 yeah ,  you really need to use the serious tag .
 people on here are idiots lol .
 i tried to convince others that the earth is a circle but they wouldn &apos;t listen .
 i once had a conversation with a professional ufc fighter and outspoken flat earther .
 i tried to explain how archimedes was able to prove the earth was round just by using his shadow .
 i mentioned air travel and how hawaii and japan are not 20+ hours of flying apart .
 but what i think got through to him the most was seasons .
 this particular guy was brazilian .
 i explained that because the earth is round ,  it’s possible to be winter in brazil and summer in the usa and vice versa .
 he nodded and stared off into the distance silently and the conversation was over .
 i don’t think i “converted” him but it gave him significant pause at the very least .
 i always have two questions for flat earthers; .
 do you believe in pearl harbor ?
 if yes ,  can you explain to me japan &apos;s flight path ?
 it took about five years .
  it was alot of willfull ignorance on my part ,  i just refused to question the logic of it .
  in fact i spent most of my time coming up with crazy fantasies about alot of things i didn &apos;t understand .
  but you have to understand that there is just so much we don &apos;t know about that sometimes our priority on what is real and what can be believed can get confused .
  i was learning so much so fast that i really didn &apos;t question something so inane as the world being flat .
  of course it was ,  why wouldn &apos;t it be .
  the day that changed it forever though was when i asked my father what happens when you get to the edge of the world ,  he of course said the world is round like a ball .
  being about five years old i thought that made alot of sense .
 there are flat earthers all over the globe .
 okay i get the question is funny and all but i actually did believe ,  for a time ,  that the earth was flat .
 i was raised in a very religious family ,  and basically came to the conclusion that the bible declared the earth was flat ,  because since i believed the earth was created in seven days ,  the idea that god set the stars in the sky in one day made much more sense if the stars were simply points of light in a sort of snowglobe formation extrapolated onto a bigger scale .
 otherwise ,  he took one day out of the seven to make a septillion or so balls of flaming gas ,  all with their own planets ,  and set each one into galaxies before breaking for lunch .
 it just didn &apos;t make sense to me that he would spend five days on one planet ,  and make the creation of the trillions of other stuff in the universe a little footnote .
 i was confronted about this belief a couple times ,  only one of which wasn &apos;t laughed off .
 that single person who engaged started a serious discussion ,  presenting much more evidence for the globe earth ,  and eventually told me to watch carl sagan .
 the cosmos series was on youtube ,  and once i watched it ,  i had to know more .
 finally ,  a video from the channel minutephysics convinced me ,  in no uncertain terms ,  that the earth was round .
 all it took was one quote ,  which i still remember leaving chills down my spine:  &apos;you should have put a serious tag on this question .
 i saw yo mama and thought ,  there &apos;s no way the earth can be flat
 i watched all these videos read a book on it talked to people about it .
 i was one of them .
 everyone else was crazy for not seeing the truth .
 (still i have alot of questions about how the heck this thing could posibly be a globe but thats besides the point) but i had an answer for everything .
 people would ask why dont we fall off the edge ?
 there is no edge the earths an infinite space .
 why do balloons pop when they go high enough ?
 because theres only so much air and it sinks to the earths surface but eventually you can fly above it and then theres no presure of the air pushing agaist thr ballon so it pops .
 hows gravity work ?
 gravity is made up i believe in buoyancy .
 but one day somebody asked me if the sun is a spotlight in the sky then how does a sunset work .
 and i looked into it .
 couldn &apos;t find anything that makes sense .
  sunsets turned me back
 tangentially related ,  but my friends and i invented the ‘australia isn’t real’ part of the flat earth conspiracy .
 we’re all from nz so convincing a large number of people our rival isn’t real was pretty cool .
 i &apos;m upvoting just for the pun .
 idc what people think about the shape of the earth as long as we all agree that we kinda need to do something bout it so that we don &apos;t perish
 i found out that the earth is just the top level of the underground civilization of lizard folk who run a cabal of witches and necromancers that feed on the life force of the unborn to maintain their immortality .
 obviously the world is not flat when there is an underground civilization hustling and bustling beneath us .
 it &apos;s more of a cone .
 man ,  i figured there would only be a couple legit ones but i was really interested .
 instead it &apos;s the same tired ass jokes you &apos;ve been recycling for the past few years .
 don &apos;t you guys get tired of upvoting dogshit like  &apos;there &apos;s flat earthers all over the globe &apos;
 i went to kindergarten and saw a globe .
 i &apos;m not a flat earther ,  but i wanna ask them ,   &apos;why would nasa and the govt lie to you ?
 why would they spend extra energy and time and money and whatever faking shit like the moon landing and outer space pictures of earth .
 my daughter (13) just told me yesterday that she was a flat earther until about 4th grade .
  not sure how i missed that for so long .
  says she figured it out seeing some pictures of the earth from outer space .
 404 serious not found
 i smoked dmt and visited space aliens .
 we looked at earth from their ship .
 definitely a globe
 i entertained it for a while .
 what convinced me the earth was a sphere was a video i came across of a group of flat earthers doing a laser test over water .
 they found a stretch of level water around 2 miles long ,  then used level lasers to measure the distance from the water .
 the test came back quite accurately indicating the earth was a sphere and not flat .
 they all got super upset and were crying about it .
 seems like a doable and effective test and their reaction ,  confusion and heartbreak seemed genuine .
 i &apos;m disappointed the majority of these answers are jokes .
 i am genuinely interested in hearing some serious answers to this .
 the flat earth society has members all around the globe .
 also ,  if the earth were flat ,  cats would have pushed everything off of the planet by now .
 feel bad for flat earthers .
 a couple years ago they were the worst .
 and then qanon stole all their shine .
 i was lonely ,  and everyone else was having a ball .
 it was fun until the anti-vaxers/maskers started taking it seriously ,  then the magic was gone ,  it was no longer fun being daft
 so he didn’t just say you were in on the conspiracy ?
 sorry i think i missed something .
 how does the earth being round help you to know about the fuel consumption ?
 or ,  did you just mean the transmission of the signal ?
 no ,  there would be no need for arguments since we &apos;re all on the same side .
 klein bottle earthers looking down their noses .
 man &apos;s just disappeared from the court like he fell off the disc
 he’s just busy searching for the edge of earth
 he has been but you just gotta open your third eye to see him and your third ear to listen .
 the peons in the media don &apos;t get that .
 the only thing flat earthers fear ,  is sphere itself .
 what i like to do is use telescopes .
 this telescope is strong enough to see distant stars and galaxies ,  yes ?
 okay ,  look out this direction across the ocean .
 can you see europe ?
 most if these people aren’t mentally stable ,  they believe in a lot of conspiracies .
 a lot of them have made it such a large part of their personality that it &apos;s not as easy as just changing their opinion .
 they have to basically reconstruct themselves which they won &apos;t do
 professor dave is the man .
 single handedly saved my grades in a bunch of upper level science courses .
 shoutout to professor dave ,  he helped me passing my organic chemistry and analytical chemistry exams
 damn that &apos;s like .
 the original proof .
 that &apos;s how the greeks calculated the circumference of the earth originally
 let’s not forget it’d be the cleanest and success guaranteed suicide .
 i mean ,  depending what’s down there .
 unless it’s an endless void and all you do is keep falling until you starve .
 you know what ,  never mind .
 if no one is making money off of it - it does .
 i am definitely gonna steal that one .
 no more stupid debates ,  this is the answer
 that &apos;s actually i think a really effective approach .
 conspiracy theorists are usually very cynical about the world and feel like something is wrong with it .
 your approach acknowledges this core conviction and invites the person to consider how their specific conspiracy would actually play out given what they believe about the world .
 this is legit a solid argument
 they actually did an experiment ,  and that if they got one result ,  the earth was flat ,  if they got the other ,  it was round .
 experiment showed that the earth is…drum roll…round !
 they claimed it was human error that caused the “wrong” result .
 if that &apos;s the netflix one ,  i think it &apos;s actually really good .
 instead of just being like ,   &apos;look at these dumbies !
  &apos; it really does take the time to build these otherwise hare-brained outsiders into empathetic characters ,  who just seem lost in a maze of their own making .
 you want them to be free .
 you want them to live a normal ,  healthy life .
 but ,  i just can &apos;t imagine the strength it takes to mentally de-program from that disorganized cult .
 my coworker watched that movie and the next day came into work and said jokingly  &apos;did you know the earth is flat ?
  &apos; i told him it was too early for his shit and we make airplanes for a living
 what i got out of the netflix one is that mark sargent doesn &apos;t actually believe in it ,  neither does that hot chick .
 they just love the attention and  &apos;fame &apos; .
  the guy wears shirts with his name on it ,  this is all he has .
 i mean ,  with all the money go to routing devices in the ground ,  no wonder there is no money left .
 if they’re in the ground ,  let’s go dig one up then !
 mexican guy: hehehe .
 if the earth was round he wouldn &apos;t be able to gaze 1000 miles .
 checkmate round earthers !
 mexican here ,  can confirm .
 earth: cries in third world country
 my go to argument against flat earth is satellite communications in general .
  i used to install satellite dishes in rural alaska where that was the only way one could communicate with the outside world .
  i &apos;ve never gotten a good answer from a flat earther in 20 years how it is faked .
  occasionally someone will suggest secret underground lines .
  so they bury secret underground lines ,  hundreds of miles across the frozen tundra ,  in concrete-like permafrost ,  just to connect up some village with a couple dozen eskimos in it ,  and no one notices these secret construction crews even though you can see for miles because there &apos;s no trees blocking the way ?
  and on top of it they inconvenience you with fake satellite delay on the phone calls just to keep the illusion going .
 not to mention the numerous space programs from countries that actively dislike each other but only cooperate on this singular issue .
 can i just ask ,  since you are a former flat earther ,  i .
 how would the earth being flat actually work ?
 this a solid point ,  there &apos;s no way 70 , 000 scientist could keep it a secret .
 since this is getting tons of replies and a lot are addressing the manhatten project i &apos;ll address it here .
 yes they did a great job at keeping it a secret while it was happening ,  but it inevitably came out .
 my point is addressing that this secret would be impossible to continue to stay secret (especially during the current information age) .
 second  thank you for the awards !
 i mean fair enough right ?
 like they don’t have anything to gain or lose no matter if the earth is flat(not saying it is) or round lmfao
 that &apos;s the exact question i ask the few flat earthers i &apos;ve met ,  but the most dug in of them have an answer:  &apos;it proves god if the earth is flat ,  so of course they won &apos;t let us know &apos;
 i think it &apos;s pretty easy for the majority of people alive today to distrust the motives and actions of government organizations .
 unfortunately this distrust manifests in many seemingly bizarre ways ,  like believing the earth is flat .
 i suppose one sort of plausible reason would be the easy allocation of funds to something more secretly sinister .
 like ,  nasa gets x billions a year ,  spends 1/5 of it on faking things ,  and the rest is spent on something the government wants kept private .
 of course ,  that ignores the fact that there are probably dozens of easier ways to do that .
 it also ignores the fact that literally anyone can prove the earth is round in a multitude of ways .
 its so nasa can sell more globes
 see that &apos;s what bugs me the most about conspiracy therories .
 like with covid .
 let &apos;s just say that bill gates acctually have made small micro chips or whatever that will be injected into people with vaccines .
 who is so arrogant to think that bill gates would give any fucks about them .
 do you really believe that you are that important ?
 i mean sure ,  it might be profitable to control putin and the like ,  but you ?
 you could litterally walk out in the middle of the street and yell out your full name with adress ,  your secrets ,  your pin number and no one would care .
 at most you would get a  &apos;cool story bro &apos; if you are lucky .
 this is one reason a lot of flat earthers have jumped ship to qanon .
 it &apos;s like a mothership conspiracy where all the other conspiracy ships can dock .
 these people just need a way to emotionally deal with all the problems they perceive the world to have .
 and for them ,  the two things that give them that are being sure that the earth was created by a higher being ,  and being sure that all the world &apos;s problems are the fault of a single group or entitiy working behind the scenes .
 the fact that they get to be a part of a community holds them there as well .
 it really is just sad .
 these are just people like you and me ,  but they just can &apos;t handle the reality of a complex world and a lack of purpose for anything and get carried away trying to find a way to make it all make sense .
 yeah ,  it seems really important to validate people and acknowledge their underlying concerns ,  rather than mock or belittle them .
 i &apos;d acknowledge their mistrust of the government ,  but remind them that the government is made of humans ,  who are faulty and fail .
 big conspiracies tend to fall apart .
 then i &apos;d invite them to consider other possible explanations for what they believe .
 it &apos;s still hard to reach them ,  but at least acknowledging their underlying concerns i think helps open them up a little bit .
 mockery and throwing facts and logic at them without empathy is less effective .
 on behind the curve on netflix ,  two of the flat earthers accused the moon of being a giant tv screen controlled by nasa .
 you aren &apos;t too far off .
 this reminds me of kurt vonnegut writing ,  great job eh
 bravo  &apos;clap clap &apos; bravo .
 i feel like there’s an “always has been” meme approaching .
 i thought this was going to be the final moments of the flat earther who committed suicide in his home made rocket
 a conspiracy theorist dies and goes to heaven .
 god tells him that all of his questions will be answered .
  &apos;who killed kennedy ?
  &apos;lee harvey oswald ,  acting alone ,  &apos; replies god .
 the man turns ,  rubs his chin ,  and mutters to himself ,   &apos;this thing goes further than i thought !
 i said the same thing on another post .
  however someone more familiar with the conspiracy said they believe the earth is actually a circle with the north pole in the middle with the south pole ,  or antarctica encircling us .
  for me it just brought up more questions .
 what did you think people were buying plane tickets to fall off the earth ?
 or you just assumed people were getting cheap tickets to be tricked by faster planes
 thank you ,  i was hoping someone had brought this up .
 that vid is especially poignant after the capitol breach by qanoners and those of related beliefs
 which is why i believe one of the best approaches is to acknowledge their underlying belief and respect for a higher power .
 i like to remind religious people that we are limited and finite ,  and if god exists ,  then god is infinitely bigger than we are and his plans are far beyond anything we can comprehend .
 god doesn &apos;t need us to acknowledge his existence ,  god exists or doesn &apos;t exist independent of our beliefs .
 if he does exist ,  no matter how complex things actually are ,  he &apos;s in control of it all .
 the person doesn &apos;t need to fear a complex world that he doesn &apos;t understand because god works on a completely different time scale and ,  according to their beliefs ,  knows what he is doing .
 if they think they have god figured out with their simple little conspiracy ,  they &apos;re being blasphemous .
 even if god revealed himself in scripture ,  our interpretations can be waay off .
 usually these people have respect for god ,  and this will at least help them entertain the possibility that they are wrong .
 it &apos;s not perfect ,  but it can help open minds .
 i spent a brief period as a 911 truther ,  which is bizarre considering i saw it happening live on tv .
 i watched one or two conspiracy videos online when they were newish ,  they asked questions that couldn &apos;t be answered ,  raised doubts ,  highlighted coincidences ,  etc .
 basically i became convinced a missile hit the pentagon ,  and that was my belief .
 i wasn &apos;t obsessive over it ,  just a background belief .
 then i came across a discussion online ,  a debate about 9/11 ,  and one poster was pointing out there was wreckage of the plane all over the pentagon grounds ,  and i was like  &apos;nope &apos; (relating to something in one of the videos) ,  however within seconds of looking online i found the photos of the wreckage ,  and just about everything else .
 to cut a long story short ,  the online  &apos;documentaries &apos; (911 conspiracy videos) i had previously watched were in fact very carefully crafted pieces of propaganda designed to make the viewer cast doubt on the event by highlighting very specific and selective pieces of information ,  out of context ,  distorted or just flat out untrue in order to hint that some vague conspiracy took place without ever specifying that conspiracy .
 now i &apos;m very much a skeptic .
 the dead giveaway to these type of conspiracy videos is that they never actually detail the conspiracy itself ,  from the ground up .
 they never provide a coherent timeline ,  never provide direct evidence of the conspiracy itself .
 it &apos;s all indirect .
  &apos;look at this discrepancy ,  look at this coincidence ,  look at this oddity - can &apos;t explain that ,  therefore conspiracy &apos; .
 same with boston bombing conspiracies ,  sandy hook ,  all that .
 identical process involved each time .
 i actually (masochistically) spend some time debunking conspiracies online every now and then ,  it &apos;s largely a futile exercise ,  but the most simple approach is just to ask someone to detail the conspiracy with credible evidence .
 they almost all instantly fall apart .
 to this day no one has ever provide a coherent 9/11 theory ,  not even the guys at ae911 who make money from this stuff .
 it &apos;s a bizarre hobby to say the least .
 this is a really solid base for anyone diving into the various conspiracy rabbit holes ,  good writing .
 and sorry about your pops .
 your comment demonstrates why one shouldn &apos;t dismiss such people as idiots .
 information is not universally distributed and not everyone has the luxury to dive deep .
 it does take time which for the middle class really is a luxury .
 i relate to your comment because i was religious once .
 had something similar happen to me and i took my time to figure it out .
 hey man ,  former 9/11 conspiracy theorist here too ,  nice to bump into my own .
 i was all about that loose change video from awhile back .
 when they ended and said “do your own research ?
 ” damnit ,  i did - i went digging for what motivations there’d be for the attack ,  the insurance companies involved ,  how our government has a precedent for lying (panama papers) ,  to why building 7 collapsed after the two main towers did .
 i was in middle school; i think i’d just been taught about burdens of proof ,  and damnit ,  i was going to carry that burden .
 but 9/11 ,  like flat earth and other conspiracies ,  always falls apart on the fact that too many involved people would have leaked something by now .
 the airlines would have to have been in on it ,  and staked three planes and their entire business on it .
 the controlled demolition idea implies thousands of pounds of explosives were snuck into a building with thousands of workers coming in and out daily ,  as well as enough trained workers to set them up in the right places .
 the gov’ mint would of course have to be in on it ,  and as we know it’s hard enough to get them to agree on pizza toppings ,  let alone unanimous bipartisan support from people with high security clearances and direct ties with the agencies who could theoretically carry something like this out .
 when you break it down ,  the theories gloss over logistics - things that would have to be carried out by far too many people for it to be even remotely mathmatically possible .
 the bigger the conspiracy ,  the more people would have to be involved to support it .
 besides ,  if trump knew something others didn’t ,  he wouldn’t shut up about it - that’s how we know half the government-centered conspiracies are bunk .
 once they &apos;ve realised their mistake ,  i &apos;d say they &apos;re really on the ball .
 well ,  the displacement is zero
 i was hoping to see this documentary in here somewhere .
 goddamn what a great video .
 i &apos;ve been to the edge .
 and i &apos;ve been to the edge .
 yes ,  i &apos;ve been to the edge .
 i &apos;ve been to the edge .
 and god knows if i &apos;ve looked down ,  .
 i &apos;ve been to the edge .
 what an edgy response
 he probably didn &apos;t change his opinion ,  but he did become ashamed of it ,  which is a good start .
 sorry but you glossed over a huge bit .
 what was the proof he requested and what did you offer ?
 you probably used circular logic
 genius and pragmatic in getting to the underlying issues there haha
 it &apos;s because most conspiracy theories ,  even the really  &apos;complex &apos; ones ,  are about solving their deep-seated sense that something is wrong with the world .
 rather than looking out how things are structured economically and socially ,  because that is infinitely more complex than even the most insane conspiracy theories ,  they simply reduce the world to good guys and bad guys and  &apos;sheep &apos; .
 it &apos;s comforting for many to think that the world is no more complex than a long running tv show .
 having a big ,  evil scary thing with a face is less terrifying than infinite chaos with really no one in charge of it all .
 that &apos;s also partly why religion plays so much of a factor into many conspiracies .
 mental issues is a good reason too .
 my sister has very intense paranoia .
 she &apos;s one of the most anxious people i &apos;ve ever met .
 so because of this ,  when she reads conspiracy theories it almost relaxes her because it makes her feel like there &apos;s some outrageous explanations to match her outrageous feelings of paranoia .
 so when she feels unsafe she &apos;ll read online that walmart has underground concentration camps and in thirty years we &apos;ll all be apart of it and that celebrities are part of the illuminati and beyonce and jay z eat babies as part of sacrifices to satan for wealth and fame .
 i know people like to joke around and make fun of people who believe this but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s funny .
 my sister literally pulls her hair out from stress and is constantly working until she passes out because she needs to do something active at all times or she starts thinking and becomes paranoid .
 delusions like these make her believe that she &apos;s found the answer to why she &apos;s so anxious all the time ,  and that answer is that the government and celebrities are lying to us .
 so i don &apos;t see a problem with it .
 she &apos;ll post a few fb posts here and there ,  she &apos;ll talk about it for a few hours a week and then come back to reality .
 my nieces and nephews know she has issues so they don &apos;t buy into so she &apos;s not poisoning their minds with lies or going to conventions on this or whatever .
 she just found a coping skill is all .
 i think some people who believe in religion or have issues believe in flat earth because if they didn &apos;t ,  it would set off a domino effect in their brain and all these lies they &apos;ve set up in their head to protect them from the truth could mentally destroy them .
 it is wider around the middle
 this obviously isn &apos;t a serious post .
  &apos;come round &apos; this post is an invitation for bad puns .
 they just keep on going on circles
 they did use aircraft carriers .
 i’m not a flat earther ,  but their map is just like the un logo so it would be almost the same
 you had me til the end .
 there are flat earthers all over around the globe .
 one might say they &apos;re a global community
 i read it to the end before i commented bud ,  don &apos;t fret
 you had me all the way until the end .
 i love how this comment beautifully separates those who clearly don &apos;t finish reading a comment before responding and those who do
 i saw yo momma and thought ,  if the earth wasn &apos;t flat before it sure as hell must be now
 show me a flat earther who doesn &apos;t mistrust all science .
 if the person isn’t accepting pretty blatant evidence of the spherical nature of earth ,  i don’t think they’ll be up for accepting climate change data .
 also ,  any former flat earther who reads the title and pops in to leave a genuine comment is going to find 1000s of people making jokes about it .
 doubt there will be any serious responses .
 imo one of the big problems right now is .
 everyone wants to be seen ,  but also be seen to be right .
 people have forgotten how to say  &apos;i was wrong about that thing &apos; and be able to shift their opinion based on new data .
 i just want to genuinely know ,  not hear unoriginal cringe jokes that have been regurgitated over and over
 it was placed there by the conspirators .
 to sell more globes
 that &apos;s a great question ,  i &apos;ll try to explain it as simply as possible: .
 ships all over the world are travelling certain distances - let &apos;s say ship a travels from location a to location b ,  and ship x travels from location x to location y .
 based on weather conditions and detailed information about the engine type and cargo load ,  we can calculate that ship a used amount a of fuel ,  and ship x used amount x of fuel .
 when the ships come into port ,  we check in with them:  .
  &apos;ship a ,  did you use amount a of fuel ?
  &apos;great ,  so we &apos;ll log your carbon emissions as such-and-such an amount ,  and you &apos;ll need to purchase so-and-so an amount of fuel in-port .
 for this calculation to work ,  the distance traveled is absolutely key .
 that distance can only be calculated based on the curvature of the earth .
 imagine a beach ball ,  and you draw 2 lines on it ,  both of the same length ,  one near the  &apos;equator &apos; and one near the  &apos;pole &apos; .
 now imagine flattening the ball into a flat map: in order to read the map ,  those distances will actually look very different ,  because the map needs to be stretched or skewed in order to look flat - that is the sort of map a flat-earther would use .
 you can &apos;t have a flat earth that maintains the exact distances travelled that are measured all over the world at any given time .
 (we are talking about thousands of ships and millions of journeys being tracked to within the metre .
 our fuel consumption calculations are very good .
 we can estimate them almost perfectly ,  based on known factors ,  and none of these calculations could possibly work if the distance was not absolutely correct .
 the distance is completely dependent on the fact that the earth is spherical .
 they &apos;d all have to be  &apos;in on it &apos; and they &apos;d all have to be mathematical geniuses .
 coming from all different countries ,  languages ,  companies ,  the very notion is ludicrous and is on par with .
 well ,  i won &apos;t say it !
 it would require a conspiracy to exist on a level that is not only impossibly complex and mathematically impossible ,  but it would also require almost every person who works at sea to be both a genius and a liar .
 now ,  i don &apos;t mean this in a disparaging way at all - but the average captain of a ship that meets the emissions reporting requirements is just an ordinary bloke with a mid-level education ,  and there &apos;s thousands of them working all over the world at any given moment .
 these are not evil geniuses .
 they are middle-aged greek men who don &apos;t like using onboard computers and think eu emissions regs are bad for business .
 these are analog processes - they can &apos;t just be intercepted and  &apos;skewed &apos; to preserve the lie ,  it &apos;s just math .
 the only sophisticated tech involved is the tracking technology - and this is not one  &apos;layer &apos; of tech .
 it &apos;s multiple layers that all sync up with each other ,  and again: some of this is very analog stuff .
 essentially: the impressive ,  tech-y ,  digital stuff (which a conspiracy theorist might see as being compromised) is actually completely dependent on the analog stuff - which can &apos;t be faked and relies on thousands of simple working-class seamen reporting what they see on a big metal dial connected to a pipe in a great big rusty old ship .
 if the tech-y stuff was really compromised in some way ,  we would know immediately ,  because none of the numbers would ever match up ,  and ship captains all over the world would be scratching their heads ,  running out of fuel ,  landing in the wrong ports ,  and nothing you ever ordered on the internet would ever get to you !
 i was going to argue with you ,  but while i composed my reply ,  i came around .
 what an unexpected twist .
 read this comment and kept scrolling and then spent a whole 5 seconds to come back and upvote it when it finally sunk in
 i wanna shake your hand .
 rarely am i tempted to read someone’s comment history ,  but i had to know .
 are you just an assassin ,  come to slay threads ?
 when i was younger i would eat my wooden bed .
 not sure why ,  i &apos;d just get to bed and start chewing on the wood .
 like a hamster or something .
 i &apos;d get loads of splinters .
 but it was great .
 he be wishin the earth was round now
 i’m saving this comment so i can come back and award you later .
 this is surprising .
 ball is round ,  why can &apos;t earth be round ?
 i mean he’s right ,  it doesn’t matter at all what shape he thinks the world is when it comes to his professional career .
 you &apos;ll understand when you &apos;re older .
 “stars are not as far as nasa tell us .
 they are much closer than europe ,  on the edge of the dome .
 actually no matter what u say ,  they’ll find a non sense explanation ,  until finally get to “because god made it this way” .
 which is the main reason why they believe in flat earth anyways .
 how many telescopes do you like to use ?
 they would lose all their flat earth friends !
 lsd and psilocybin broke a lot of shit loose for me and i gave up some toxicity and dumbass points of view i had held for a while .
 it &apos;s not for everyone ,  but it will absolutely make you more open to accepting reality for what it is and willing to deconstruct yourself a bit .
 i &apos;ve also never heard a good reason from flat earthers as towhy someone would want to hide the earth being flat .
 it &apos;s almost always ,   &apos;look !
 the earth is flat !
 what else could they be hiding !
 they calculated the circumference of the earth by imagining a really long line ?
 no ,  they calculated the circumference of the earth by noticing shadows were shorter in alexandria thsn in athens and extrapolating from there .
 that is not how to they calculated the circumference of the earth ,  maybe you should look that one up lol .
 and if that was the case ,  it would be the best way to dispose of toxic waste and garbage .
 just yeet it into the fucking void .
 the turtle probably just eats you ,  i mean what else has he been surviving on .
 na you &apos;ll just be back in the next movie when they activate the tesseract .
 hell ,  people make money off plenty of things that don &apos;t exist too .
 if you &apos;re going to reply please come up with something less obvious than  &apos;the church &apos; .
 they would say that telling us the world is a sphere is to justify spending money on researching said sphere but actually using that money to control humanity .
 i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t hear about the wall of ice around the edge of the earth .
 they also spent $20000 on a very precise gyroscope .
 of course it showed a 15 degree per hour drift ,  thus proving the spherical earth .
 they didn’t accept this result and blamed it on picking up the rotation of “the heavens” .
 so they did another experiment with the gyroscope in a zero gauss chamber so that the sky wouldn’t affect it .
 and they still claimed something else must have been wrong .
 there is nothing that will convince these people .
 at least these deeper entrenched “bigger name” people are too far in ,  and can’t ever leave their group that they are so tied to .
 i also believe a lot of the higher up people absolutely do not believe the earth is flat and are just grifting people for the money .
 i saw that documentary too .
 the experiment was  &apos;if the earth is round ,  this compass will move 3 degrees .
  &apos; it did ,  so then they made a new compass and got the same result !
 another one was they said  &apos;if the earth is round ,  this light won &apos;t hit that piece of wood !
  &apos; it doesn &apos;t ,  so they get a new piece of wood and get the same result .
 they were doing actually very good science trying to falsify their hypotheses .
 they failed when they didn &apos;t adjust their hypotheses in light of current data .
 a 15 degree per hour drift .
 morons spent 20k dollars for a laser gyroscope and managed to prove the earth is round .
 but guess what ,  they still won &apos;t accept it .
 they just said  &apos;oh .
 well ,  that &apos;s interesting .
 i got the opposite out of it  .
 the shots and transitions were perfectly timed for comedic effect .
 looking straight at the eclipse ,  talking about the conspiracy theories behind her name as ridiculous ,  the simple tests that people were performing straight from the flat earth website ,  the final ending where they prove the earth is round  .
 i assumed the title  &apos;behind the curve &apos; was directly referencing their intelligence .
 behind the bell curve in iq .
 i laughed the whole time .
 it was pure comedy gold
 shit he &apos;s got a point
 this made me chuckle lol
 and then they go and dig up someone &apos;s septic tank
 they are buried on the other side .
 which is also similar to the conspiracies about covid .
 you know ,  all those different countries ,  governments ,  political parties ,  guerrilla groups ,  ideologies hating each other and fighting each other ?
 they miraculously came together in harmony ,  to fabricate a non-existing pandemic .
 it &apos;s the age of aquarium !
 that &apos;s the big thing for me .
  even during the 60 &apos;s and 70 &apos;s when the soviets were competing with the us for space control ,  they weren &apos;t contradicting any nasa information about the state of the earth and space that would have embarrassed them .
 if there was an agreeable theory ,  it would be more widely accepted belief .
 most flat earthers have a wide range of theories for why and how it would be flat .
 that &apos;s the biggest reason for me to not believe so many conspiracy theories ,  especially major ones like a flat earth .
 we know how often things leak about everything ,  and suddenly a collection of 10s of thousands of people are all gonna keep this one big secret ?
 they don &apos;t and here &apos;s a youtube video full of memes to prove it
 that is why i laugh at the 9/11  &apos;inside job &apos; people .
  the amount of people that would have to keep that a secret is astounding .
  from government agencies to people in the military ,  there are so many there is no way everyone would keep their mouth shut .
 i asked this question to many flat earthers and if it isn’t some overly vague pretentious deep state/1984 is now kind of response it’s something overly religious .
 unless they &apos;re part of the deep state
 wouldn &apos;t it only prove that god is a sucky engineer if it was flat ?
 weirdly ,  a flat earth doesn &apos;t really prove god so .
 like i get it ,  they &apos;re anxious because they think their faith is under direct attack by modern society .
 it &apos;s not ,  but they &apos;re just that insecure to think so .
 and will cling to liferafts to avoid having to seriously and internally address their insecurities .
 it &apos;s always so baffling to me .
 yeah ,  the government is doing shady ,  fucked up ,  evil shit ,  but people keep coming up with reasons to say that it &apos;s lizard people ,  or aliens ,  or sasquatch pedophile rings .
 and i wanna say ,  like  &apos;no ,  guys .
 they &apos;re just greedy racist assholes .
 they did x cause they wanted money from exxonmobile ,  and cause they personally benefit from having a militarized police force .
 there &apos;s such a weird division between between people who are actually critical of the government and conspiracy wackos that like .
 really doesn &apos;t need to exist .
 except nasa’s funding is laughably tiny compared to openly funded defence projects .
 the funds that get allocated to nasa projects wouldn’t go very far at all .
 who is so arrogant to think .
 that &apos;s it right there .
  part of the allure of conspiracies is that everyone else are sheeple ,  but #i am the enlightened one .
  these true believers are too dumb to know how stupid they really are .
 this is a bad argument .
 individually does it matter to have 1 persons info ?
 no ,  to your point .
 but collectively ,  information on millions of people does matter and is one of the most marketable and profitable “products” currently .
 see the most profitable companies: google ,  facebook ,  apple ,  amazon ,  etc .
 they all have and sell your data and make billions doing so .
 in case it isn’t clear ,  bill gates is not putting microchips in a vaccine .
 just saying this is a bad argument against those that think he is .
 there are better arguments out there .
 once i think i saw a windows alert screen pop up on the moon and a cursor quickly clicked on the ok button .
 fools ,  they should only apply updates on a new moon .
 man ,  i wish we actually lived in a universe where nasa’s budget was that big .
 barely related ,  but i just wanted to share that i recently found out that kurt vonnegut fucking hated geraldo rivera ,  who was briefly his son-in-law .
 he said  &apos;he &apos;s obviously a scumbag ,  because he started making love to other people and betraying my daughter and her innocence from the very beginning .
 if i see jerry again i &apos;ll spit in his face .
 i really like kurt vonnegut .
 hi this is kurt vandango
 they think the earth is a big pizza with a crust made of icy mountains .
 the north pole is the center where all the slices meet .
 the pizza is on a rotating plate with a small heat lamp that can only cover about half the pizza .
 sorry ,  i &apos;m kind of hungry .
 that explanation has always baffled me .
 like ,  they do know night and day are a thing right ?
 and that the sun isn &apos;t just emitting light in a very small fixed direction ,  but rather in all directions ?
 it &apos;s a quicker journey depending which direction you travel from .
 if the world is flat ,  a straight line is the shortest distance .
 on a sphere ,  shortest distance over the surface is along the arc of a great circle .
 theres too much scientifically proven and quantitative/qualitative data to prove or to atleast justify this .
 the only justification the conspiracy theorist has is their senses ,  and some posts and videos theyve seen online .
 (atleast thats my paradigm of them)
 the dead giveaway to these type of conspiracy videos is that they never actually detail the conspiracy itself ,  from the ground up .
 they never provide a coherent timeline ,  never provide direct evidence of the conspiracy itself .
 it &apos;s all indirect .
  &apos;look at this discrepancy ,  look at this coincidence ,  look at this oddity - can &apos;t explain that ,  therefore conspiracy &apos; .
 some modern conspiracies have gotten  &apos;smarter &apos; and provide really shitty  &apos;proof &apos; that has 10 levels of sourcing that end up back at some 8chan /pol thread that isn &apos;t even accessible but just a screenshot .
 nonetheless ,  most conspiracies follow that same  &apos;look i &apos;m asking a question that can &apos;t be answered right now if you don &apos;t know the appropriate context ,  that must mean there is some dark figures pulling strings .
 what frustrates/terrifies me is watching other people fall into this now .
 i know what worked for me ,  but by in large outside intervention isn &apos;t what pulled me out of the abyss .
 i &apos;m never sure of what to do other than follow up their questions with more questions to try to get them see the errors themselves .
 thanks ,  i appreciate it .
 not something you can really prepare for ,  but it will change who you are in some fashion .
 you &apos;re very right ,  but i think of it kind of like drug addiction (obviously not quite as detrimental) where you can &apos;t really help them until they are willing to accept the help - they have to be somewhat open to changing in the first place .
 as long as they don’t continue to bounce between the options
 i love how these comments all circle back around
 i went halfway and got a pi for dessert
 i get everyone &apos;s here for a joke ,  the real joke is the shit growing in the shadows .
 where have you been ?
 didn’t quite get that .
 i think that &apos;s the first eiffel 65 reference i &apos;ve ever seen that wasn &apos;t blue .
 i don &apos;t agree ,  shame will make him want to forget everything about it including the lessons he could have learned from it
 sounds related to another very common fallacy that you’ll start seeing everywhere once you know about it: the omega inconsistency fallacy (sounds like a sci-fi novel lol) .
 it’s where people believe that something exists ,  or maybe even that it happens all the time ,  but they’ll also deny any and all particular examples or evidence that you give them .
 — “could you be convinced that the earth is round ?
 — “yes ,  i’m an intelligent person who values reason ,  so enough evidence would certainly convince me .
 — “here is overwhelming evidence .
 — “well ,  that’s not sufficient evidence .
 another frequent one: .
 — “do you agree that sexism happens ?
 — “of course ,  i think it’s sadly quite common .
 — “this woman says she experienced sexism .
 — “well ,  maybe it was just a misunderstanding .
 in an isolated case ,  these conversations don’t prove anything .
 maybe it wasn’t convincing evidence ,  maybe it was a misunderstanding .
 but if someone persistently does this ,  they’re committing omega inconsistency—no amount of mere logical evidence will actually change their mind .
 the original conversation wasn &apos;t specifically about flat earth ,  but it was a collateral belief damage .
 it started with him wanting proof that sars-cov-2 (corona virus) was real .
 he claimed it had never been isolated or photographed (because all he saw in the media was  &apos;cgi &apos;) ,  that it didn &apos;t make sense that a virus from a bat could infect a human because we ,  as he did correctly state ,  are not bats .
 i linked him multiple peer-reviewed ,  pre-covid scientific articles about zoonotic diseases ,  including the prevalence at which they come from bats/birds/livestock ,  an interview with a usaid predict researcher (also the  .
 gov website reflecting his association with the facility) about how they anticipated the virus ,  and a national institute of health primary article photographing an isolated sars-cov-2 virus .
 that &apos;s when he said it was all lies and that i  &apos;probably believe the earth is round and that we went to the moon &apos; ,  which is when i made the comment about believing anything since clearly he would have disregarded round-earth proof anyway as well .
 i really wish i would have screenshot the conversation before he deleted it all ,  they were (if i do say so) pretty solid shutdowns .
 he took him to space ,  duuuhh !
 they &apos;re too scared to believe that the world is truly just as chaotic ,  meaningless ,  and uncontrollable as it seems .
 for them ,  it &apos;s comforting to think that if only the  &apos;evil controller &apos; could be stopped ,  things would be finally okay .
 this was actually pretty enlightening .
 i was diagnosed with sever generalized anxiety disorder ,  and i &apos;ve noticed i have a habit of staying up late reading conspiracy theories and scary stories when my anxiety ramps up .
 i don &apos;t usually buy into any of it ,  but it does make feel better in a weird nosleep kinda way .
 yeah ,  i feel like the center of the venn diagram for flat earthers and redditt browsers is really ,  really small .
 sphere me the details
 explain the aircraft carrier path then
 there are flat earthers all over around circling the globe .
 i think the problem is that flat earthers who change their mind are incredibly rare .
 there’s not many flat earthers to begin with and only a tiny percentage of them will ever change their mind .
 big globe is fooling us all
 i know this guy is joking but i’ve actually heard this dumb argument before lmao-  .
 making spheres would take more money in production than sheets lmao they would be able to cut alot of expenses by not lying if the earth actually were flat
 that was a fascinating answer .
 thank you very much .
 i like the bit that speaks directly to the flat earth part just in case i had doubts haha .
 which ,  i should clarify i absolutely am not (i just wasn &apos;t sure on the process) .
 your career sounds fascinating and kind of fun .
 can i ask what the job title might be ?
 honest to god ,  same .
 not to the point of splinters ,  but i definitely had teeth marks on my bunk bed .
 he wants to hide in the corners .
 if the earth is round he &apos;ll eventually be found .
 but it does matter for sponsoring if brands don’t want to associate with him .
 and for the league to push him as a role model if his beliefs are batshit .
 just realized that response applies to almost all eli5’s
 i have an in-law (not immediate thank god) that thinks someone hangs the moon up .
 just one for each star and planet in the sky .
 nothing too excessive .
 erastosthanes: takes bong hit  bro how long you think a line would have to be before you couldn &apos;t tell if was curving ?
 252 , 000 stadia or something right ?
  i bet that &apos;s how big around the earth is .
 i don’t know why i’m laughing so hard
 no ,  they took a roughly 10m spire ,  measured its shadow or something ,  then math .
 ribohome:  does their own research    .
 ribohome:  becomes flat earther 
 until the extra-dimensional terrors show up to find out who has been raining shit on them .
 you know ,  just your average hyperdimensional octopus made entirely of sentient teeth minding his own business feeding on the negative emotions of the cosmos .
 suddenly the contents of a taco bell dumpster end their century long fall right on his mantle .
 or ya know ,  dead bodies and murder evidence
 and nuclear waste .
 fuck ,  i’m starting to wish the earth was flat .
 i yelled into the void once ,  and the void responded with jazz .
 lol ,  i was hoping that  &apos;penguinati &apos; was a term they actually used .
 that is a really good one
 the penguinatii lol i’m dying
 like the flat earth
 i wonder if the “bigger names” believe or they just want to be “important .
 ” i watched the doc and it seemed like there were some big sad sad egos .
 fame and admiration are one hell of a drug !
 i don &apos;t get how you can be this solid in your math and physics and still be a flat earther ?
  how does someone run these elaborate experiments with apparently a genuine understanding of like rigid body mechanics and electromagnetism .
 and still believe in flat earth ?
 it was the light on wood one that i remember .
  &apos;if the earth is round the light will be high off the ground &apos;  .
 lo and behold they lifted it and there was light .
 exactly ,  good science works to disprove itself ,  instead of the proving a point .
 real science tests to see if there is another explanation .
 lol ,  thankfully they can &apos;t put together any sort of real debate to save their lives .
 this is a funny sort of trump card that doesn &apos;t really make sense ,  but in the moment i &apos;d maybe be taken aback and have to concede i don &apos;t believe it ,  but if that &apos;s what they believe i can &apos;t honestly dispute it .
 this is why arguing in good faith sucks haha
 see ,  i told you this conspiracy was full of shit !
 persona mexicana: jejeje .
 also one of the strongest arguments for landing on the moon .
 russia never doubted it .
 if there had been any whiff of shenanigans russia would have exposed it immediately .
 i &apos;ve just always wondered what they think is on the underside of the earth .
 and if they think if they dig far enough ,  they &apos;ll fall through into space .
 flat earth is absolutely shit tier .
 it not only fails on the level you described ,  but also: why ?
 why pretend the shape of the earth is different than it is ?
 when does someone convene a high level meeting to circulate that idea ?
 most conspiracies fall flat because they would require too many people to keep quiet .
 i had an argument at work with someone over the whole votes this election .
 i was like  &apos;dude ,  the lawyer that represented you guys could not prove his case .
  &apos; and he &apos;s like  &apos;oh cause they don &apos;t want to investigate it &apos; and i &apos;m like  &apos;he &apos;s your fucking guy !
 he &apos;s on your side !
 why would he not investigate it when he &apos;s going around asking for trial by combat like he &apos;s in game of thrones and shit !
 the amount of hoops this people just to reach their logic is fucking mental .
 that sorta depends on the conspiracy .
    &apos;the government did is and hid the evidence &apos; .
 yeah ,  thats unlikely ,  however ,  the  &apos;a few key people at the top knew it was going to happen ,  and let it happen &apos; is much easier to believe .
   also ,   &apos;classified &apos; things exist .
 there is an old saying from benjamin franklin: .
 three men can keep a secret ,  if two of them are dead .
 every conspiracy i’ve ever heard falls apart there .
 the minute you tell me there has to be a coordinated effort by hundreds ,  if not thousands ,  of people and not a single one says anything or leaks anything or even accidentally lets a secret slip is the moment i know a conspiracy is bullshit .
 the odds of that many people keeping a secret is quite literally zero .
 i worked for government and can attest they can &apos;t keep anything together ,  let alone a complicated conspiracy .
 the only semi-logical reasoning that could make sense is that nasa lied to us because of the space race .
 the russians were way ahead .
 so nasa faked the moon landing .
 and to keep up the lie ,  they had to lie about the earth being flat also .
 btw i don &apos;t believe in any of this .
 but its some of what i heard them say .
 and its the only answer to that question that would maybe(big maybe) make sense
 the goddamn insidious deep state
 not very good at designing spines either .
 you &apos;re exactly right .
 like ,  i &apos;m religious too ,  but not everything is the government trying to eradicate your religion .
 i mean ,  if your religion is right ,  then it doesn &apos;t really matter what everyone else does or thinks cuz god &apos;s gonna fix it .
 jesus isn &apos;t gonna descend and say  &apos;you guys think the earth is round ?
  &apos; and dip off ,  lol
 cause it &apos;s hard to accept all the worst shit is happening out in the open and no one is doing anything ,  at least anything capable of stopping it .
 so as a cope ,  you decide that there must be something else ,  something people don &apos;t know that would stir everyone to action if they did ,  and whatever that is ,  well the people in power have to be scared of you finding it out and exposing it ,  right ?
 it let &apos;s you feel like you have agency in a process that i  reality doesn &apos;t really care about you all that much .
 in my teens i was one step away from being a full blown conspiracy theorist .
 one of the feelings i enjoyed was a sense of having this knowledge that made me feel superior and important .
 imagine thinking they get to choose when to do windows updates
 i wonder how homero ,  plato ,  aristotle lied about the moon on their stories if there were no moon !
 because obviously the moon is as old as nasa .
 another vonnegut fun fact: in college he shared a dorm room with dr .
 vonnegut had to yell at him to stop drawing weird seuss characters on the walls .
 had drinks with him once .
 the best bar poet .
 midtown east/upper east side ,  i think jameson &apos;s/mulligan &apos;s or something .
 make no mistake ,  he was a drunk ,  but it was like getting to listen to hemingway in a key west dive .
 i saw him a few times at this place .
 no one ever talked about his books .
 i had yet to read them .
 girlfriend at the time gave me slaughterhouse 5 .
 i was amazed ,  because i thought he was more historical fiction ?
 the sci fi totally took me by surprise .
 i wish i had read his books before drinking with him .
 gf knew ,  but was a typical new yorker .
 you don &apos;t acknowledge stardom/success .
 you treat everyone the same .
 i feel like something happened .
 he burned himself or almost did ,  and then we never saw him .
 i &apos;m pretty sure his brownstone was nearby ,  because at christmas time i remember hearing something about christmas carols to kurt &apos;s brownstone .
 he &apos;d love to hate it .
 that actually really helped me understand their thinking
 according to the flat earth theory ,  the sun is more like a flashlight than a lightbulb .
 not if you travel through the planet core .
 i &apos;ve never heard this argument made ,  but maybe there &apos;s a more existential/philosophical reason ?
  ,  i perceive the earth to be flat ,  therefore my reality is  .
 i dunno ,  just spitballin
 it &apos;s genuinely sad to see well-meaning people just get sucked in .
 it &apos;s practically a mini-industry now (alex jones is worth millions) .
 they all use the exact same toolbox of manipulative techniques to entice a certain type of person in ,  and once the belief is planted it can set like concrete ,  trumping any reason/rationale .
 i think it &apos;s a much bigger problem than most people realise .
 depends on the person .
 but if someone ever changes their view point from a ridiculous one like that ,  there has to be shame .
 either before they change or after they change later in life when looking back .
 there will definitely be cringe moments in his life later on that will keep him up at night .
 whether he wants to or not ,  shame makes you remember forever so you don &apos;t repeat whatever brought you shame the first time .
 i felt shame for being a homophobe when i was younger and it definitely helped start me on the path to redemption .
 that and a very loving gay couple who i played dnd with that treated me like family .
 i grew up in a very not ok environment .
 because all he saw in the media was  &apos;cgi &apos; .
 motherfucker ,  he got us .
 alright folks ,  visual aids are out .
 no more visual aids .
 it &apos;s just text and red lines pointing from one word to another from here on out .
 we ,  as he did correctly state ,  are not bats .
 i couldn &apos;t help but chuckle at that .
 top-tier critical thinking !
 boo pay for wall article
 that could just be a projection from bill gates the evil lizard egg laying mastermind
 there &apos;s actually some flat earth subreddits .
 i used to go on one from time to time cause i was curious (about the people not the  &apos;theory &apos;) ,  then i got banned for questioning something .
 the subreddit was r/notaglobe and i just looked at it again and it &apos;s been taken over by new mods and everyone has been unbanned ,  it &apos;s a discussion sub now rather than an echo chamber .
 i feel like it &apos;ll be pretty one sided ,  probably no actual flat earthers there anymore .
 you &apos;re very welcome .
 my job title is  &apos;marketing manager &apos; ,  and has also been head of marketing ,  vp marketing ,  cmo .
 whatever fits best depending on the role or the company i &apos;m at .
 i know it sounds a bit generic and fluffy ,  right ?
 but i work exclusively in b2b tech companies .
 so an understanding of technology ,  how it works ,  and how it solves business problems is crucial .
 my time in the maritime industry was exceptionally interesting and i got to travel all over the globe (lol !
 ) and was really amazed at the complexity involved ,  as well as the mix of analog and digital requirements in order for the whole thing to work .
 it &apos;s really cool .
 it &apos;s also full of so many interesting people !
 being young and female was a challenge though ,  as sexual harassment (on a relatively benign level) was a pretty consistent theme throughout my time in that role .
 but for the most part ,  i was able to assert myself as  &apos;one of the boys &apos; when it came to the whiskey-and-cigars-and-doing-business stuff ,  and i went for a kind of  &apos;mad men &apos; look where i was dressed in such a way that everyone knew i meant business .
 no ,  it wasn &apos;t ideal ,  but i &apos;m very pragmatic about my life and overall it was a good experience .
 besides ,  sometimes it &apos;s fun to shock some sexist old dinosaur by demonstrating a far better grasp of the technical issues being discussed than he does .
 right after he &apos;s asked you to fetch him a coffee .
 (i spent a fair amount of time pointing to the kitchen - the coffee machine is in there .
 i &apos;m head of marketing .
 no ,  you &apos;ll have to ask at the front desk ,  that &apos;s where you &apos;ll find our receptionist .
 ) i now work in a company that has built a platform for property developers to manage some pretty complex financial modelling that has historically been a real headache ,  so it &apos;s been fun get in on  &apos;the ground floor &apos; of a new kind of tech .
 business is good and i &apos;m able to be fully-remote ,  which is wonderful and has allowed me to move out of london to the countryside .
 marketing - in the context of b2b - is a very broad and interesting discipline .
 i would never work in b2c .
 selling crap to people who don &apos;t need it ?
 no thanks ,  the world is materialistic enough already .
 but using tech to help solve business problems ?
 yeah cool ,  i can get behind that .
 mobius: an endless line of jokes
 g n a w l e d g e
 technically i think they believe the earth is round .
 they just don &apos;t believe it is spherical .
 your username is fascinating
 i knew there was a reason i couldn &apos;t dunk .
 all those years paying with a round ball when i should have had a flat one
 this one specifically ,  because they only realized at 6
 i build satellites for a living ,  and myself and some co-workers were at a bar once and really got some flat-eathers going with stuff that was a lot like this .
  &apos;back in the 50s they had it easy ,  they only needed one little light to orbit and play a beeping on the local radio station .
 one iron track and some high voltage wiring and they were done .
  &apos;most of the track we bolted up there is from the 80s ,  and the anchors they used to pin it to the crystal sphere are all kinds of rusty now .
 we had to make some big improvements to keep the illusion going and hang more than one satellite in a string .
  &apos;oh yeah they developed vantablack to keep the rails from being seen from the ground .
 we go to great lengths to make sure you can &apos;t actually buy it &apos;  .
 fun ,  but in retrospect probably not that great for the state of the world .
 no ,  that’s ridiculous .
 σελήνη pulls it around in her chariot .
 someone hangs the moon up .
 do they even realize how big the moon is ?
 that thing takes 3 or 4 people ,  minimum ,  to hang up every night .
 i swear we are surrounded by imbeciles .
 there’s a discord server called the flat earth society where they advertise it as a “fun place to come and debate .
 newsflash: it’s not fun .
 if you’re anything but a flat earther and you try to make a point ,  you’re instantly swarmed by all of them .
 they won’t give you a chance to speak ,  and often times refuse to answer questions and instead just hurl insults at you .
 the worst part ,  the admins actively mute anybody who proves them wrong ,  they will actually kick you from the call and then tell everybody else you left ,  so it looks like they “owned you .
 it’s absolute cancer ,  they’re in absolute denial .
 i don’t know why i’m laughing ,  so hard .
 you might be thinking of how the egyptians determined the earth was round
 wouldn &apos;t it be even worse ?
 he loves the waste and then people have to produce more waste to feed his appetite ,  and then once it &apos;s almost barren ,  his mom comes and erases us from existence for ruining his teeth on their analog of high-sugar products - and can you imagine how expensive the extra-reality dentistry for something made entirely of teeth is ?
 yep ,  that got me .
 great ,  well now we know why they &apos;re hiding it from everyone .
  nobody gives away a good body dumping site .
 that &apos;s where we get rid of everyone that cracks the code  .
 - from a member of the nasa conspiracy
 plot twist: universe is round and it just swings back around .
 if a few of us hang out in their discussion boards for a few weeks ,  i guarantee you we could make it a term they actually use .
 and it comes full circle !
 they want to continue feeling special .
 to them it’s like being in an exclusive club .
 they know the real truth about the world .
 i think it’s a combination of that and the camaraderie .
 they have a place where they feel like they belong .
 “nah ,  steve ,  you’re doing it wrong !
 “i’m doing it wrong ,  too .
 hey does anybody know how to work this thing ?
 same with anti vaxxers .
  when logic gets in their way ,  they just call me a sheep and run away .
 it’s turtles all the way down
 why pretend the shape of the earth is different than it is ?
 because the people that believe it get quickly funneled into dark propaganda .
 because the fuel source that keeps the earth rising upwards to create gravity is babies ,  specifically infant adrenochrome
 not only that but it involves the high ranking people involved to set aside their arrogance ,  pride and work together .
 so let me get this straight: you &apos;re telling me that the reason why people would do this is because they &apos;re so insanely arrogant and have so little care for other human beings on this planet that they would swallow their ego and pride to do this ?
 yeah this seems to really poke a hole in a lot of them .
 i was reading a great one on /r/conspiracy about human-like creatures that live in the water and have been there for longer than humans have been around and are incredibly technologically advanced - so yes ,  basically atlantis .
 super fun to read ,  and had some really great details ,  but then started talking about how the navy knows about it ,  how every major nation &apos;s government knew about and had contact with them ,  etc .
 as awesome as fish-aliens would be ,  there &apos;s just no way that many people can keep it a secret .
 on top of that ,  i &apos;m pretty sure that trump would not have been able to keep his mouth shut .
 the attention he would get from announcing another sentient ,  conscious form of life on earth would be too enticing for him to keep it a secret .
 this is exactly right .
 i hang my hat on this fact and it &apos;s why i &apos;m beyond skeptical of 99% of the bs conspiracies out there .
 but most actual conspiracies are uncovered ,  not leaked .
 tuskegee experiments were active for almost 40 years with no leaks ,  we &apos;re talking everyone involved being highly educated and sworn by the hippocratic oath and for nearly 40 years not a single person spoke out .
 yep ,  people will believe what they want despite the evidence .
  i love the people who were like .
 it wasn &apos;t a plane it sounded like a missile .
  really ,  when was the last time you heard a missile ?
  i have heard them in my time in the military and literally everyone in the area is going to know if a missile cruises by them .
 it &apos;s because when a case is dismissed they think it means the judges never even looked at what the evidence was at all ,  they just up and chuck the entire file into a shredder without considering what &apos;s in it .
 you &apos;re arguing with people that will reject any evidence that doesn &apos;t agree with them ,  when there &apos;s literally no evidence to support their side ,  will fall back to ,   &apos;it &apos;s suspicious that there &apos;s no evidence &apos; .
 they &apos;ll never accept logic unless it tells them what they want to hear .
 they &apos;re not stupid tho .
 try making up something ridiculous and easily disprovable in support of your side .
 mostly they &apos;ll figure it out and disprove it with facts and cited sources .
 should give you some clue where their head &apos;s at .
 are you kidding ,  that could never happen in the us .
 nobody would ever find out about an attack being planned and just ignore it .
 yeah people are swinging a bit too much in the other direction here .
 for years it was said that the american government had a role in the latin american dictatorships in the 70s but it wasn &apos;t confirmed until recently .
 some times things are kept a secret and then come out but when they come out they are hard to prove .
 so let me be clear ,  i don &apos;t believe in this conspiracies ,  but that if it were true it would &apos;ve come out is a bad way of disproving them since the fact that it &apos;s talked about could be because it did in fact came out .
 yeah like the meme about covid being a hoax: these people obviously haven’t been project managers because it’s so hard just to make 12 people do everything they have to do on time ,  imagine coordinating all the politicians as well as medical personnel across so many countries including ones that hate each other ?
 the problem with it is that every world power would have to be in agreement to keep this all hidden from the public .
 ignoring the major issue of all world governments agreeing on anything at all ,  you still have to take into account how they could possibly keep it a secret .
 i &apos;ve told this all to a flat earther and they insisted that somehow this was actually happening .
 then i asked the question that they never have an answer to .
 he hit me with some mumbo jumbo about keeping us all ignorant .
 i told him no government has to worry about keeping their population stupid ,  look at him .
 will constable cuodo keep an eye on the former kardashian spy garack obama ?
 omg it &apos;s so deep
 i &apos;d like the teeth update first
 you can tell intelligent design is false because have you seen knees ?
 nothing wrong with the human spine that walking on all fours wouldn’t fix
 the thing that confuses me is i also live in america and at no point have i felt like the government was in any way shape or form out to get christianity .
 plato ,  homero ,  aristotle and basically anything that  &apos;existed &apos; before nasa are all made up by nasa to make the world look older than it actually is .
  &apos;oh but my grandpa is older than nasa ,  he remembers the fifties &apos; they implanted memories in those people .
 nasa is the devil trying to make us reject god ,  and when we do we lose our sense of importance ,  we feel lost ,  broken ,  out of place ,  then they use their mind controlling 5g to turn us in a perfect cog for the system .
 i’m sad this doesn’t exist ,  it would just be full of kevin memes though .
 which i’d be okay with .
 its also  3000 miles up making sunsets mathematically impossible .
 you can either fly nearly 11000 miles over the atlantic ,  europe and asia .
 or you can fly 6000 miles over the pacific .
 one direction quick ,  one direction slow
 flying over the pacific ocean (where hawaii is) is significantly shorter to travel than going over the atlantic ocean and having a layover in another country before arriving at your final destination .
 you’d be looking at half a days travel compared to a full 24h or more (from canada to the philippines with a layover in hong kong took me 27h) .
 edit bc i accidentally forgot a word 
 say he lives in hawaii ,  it would be quick to fly over the ocean directly to japan than to fly across the u .
 the only way that is possible is because the earth is round .
 no ,  it’s really not .
 there’s some religious basis to it (not to mention some very prominent antisemitism) but no worthwhile philosophical thought .
 only bad science and not understanding how gradual the curvature of the earth is .
 flat edges does have a ring to it .
 in the famous words of lady gaga: “the edge ,  the edge ,  the edge ,  the edge ,  the edge ,  the edge ,  the edge”
 there will definitely be cringe moments in his life later on that will keep him up at night .
 i honestly think this is a requirement for a functioning adult .
 there are definitely moments in my life that make me lay awake on occasion .
 when i was in the 4th grade i read a book about how crystals had healing properties and how different crystals could be used to heal different things .
 i bought some crystals with my allowance money and tried to use them to heal myself ,  get more energy ,  etc .
 i was young and it was in a book so i believed it .
 my friends still make fun of me for this 30 years later .
 i am deeply ashamed ,  and i also get extremely angry whenever someone comes around and starts telling me about the healing power of crystals or any new age bullshit like that .
 damn flat-earthers putting 3d artists out of business .
 i used to be active on /r/geocentrism until i was banned (twice !
 ) for asking questions .
 basically any subreddit for flat earth has to moderate extremely heavily or the flat earthers will leave .
 basically no post there ever had positive karma ,  and if it didn’t have strict moderation the “discussion” would be drowned out by people calling them idiots .
 flat earth is so dumb that it attracts people that treat it like a zoo exhibit and just spam insults instead of actually discussing it ,  and you have to be so deluded to believe the theory that any “honest” discussion just involves the fe person disregarding everything the normal person says .
 plus ,  from what i’ve seen ,  normal people are really bad at explaining why the earth is round or understanding the fe’s (admittedly insane) arguments enough to actually argue against what they’re saying instead of what they believe they’re saying .
 i’m assuming anyone from /r/notaglobe that actually believed left and retreated back to weird facebook groups and youtube conspiracy bubbles .
 so like a petri dish ?
 all balls are flat .
  they just proved it with a picture .
  where’s the curve ?
  stop trying to push your lies lizard-man .
 it &apos;s a well-rounded joke ,  really comes full circle .
 neither does whoever hangs up the moon .
 that &apos;s why we have a new moon; the guy just gets lazy and doesn &apos;t hang up the moon .
 kinda weird that he gets lazy every 29 days though .
 that’s exactly what i said !
  like the truman show ?
 and with confidence “yeah kinda !
 ”  as if he finally got me to understand .
 for a long time the highest classes of egyptians were also greeks .
 if you told me the earth is flat because governments all across the world dump their dirty secrets off id almost believe you
 out there ,   they are a crazy kook ,  mentally feeble and outcast .
  on flat earth ,  they are wise professors of the hidden truth
 i think you just defined organized religion .
 i mean they could be trying to get away from the flames on your butt .
 i know you’re not serious but reading that hurts me deeply .
 i thought it was 4 elephants riding on the back of great a &apos;tuin .
 i never thought of this .
 it really is like a litmus test for gullible folks .
 if i was starting a cult i &apos;d start recruitment with flat earthers .
 this is one of my favorite ways to debunk conspiracies .
 if the moon landings were fake you &apos;d know the soviets would have been all over that shit .
 but no ,  the soviets congratulated us .
 and for some reason all of the moon landing was fake-ers seem to be here in the us .
 or in other words: .
 congress dems/reps can &apos;t even agree to sign the bill that funds their own paychecks ,  but they all came together in harmony to attack the world trade centers ,  and have stayed quiet about it ever since ?
 there is no way that trump could keep aliens quiet lmao
 if every nation has made contact with them ,  then whats to stop some fishermen to accidentally run into them ?
 conspiracy theories are sometimes straight up hoaxes .
 i’ve only ever found one that i believe ,  and that is that michael jordan’s baseball flirtation was covering up that he had been suspended from the nba bc of his gambling .
 some of them are quite creative though
 and what is a plane ,  but a missile that people ride in ?
 i just go beyond them .
 the towers were never there to begin with .
 remember when the nsa was a conspiracy theory
  for years it was said that the american government had a role in the latin american dictatorships in the 70s but it wasn &apos;t confirmed until recently .
 and things like mk ultra and operation northwoods ,  the cia smuggling cocaine into the us ,  etc .
 get declassified but no one ever goes ,   &apos;huh ,  those  &apos;batshit crazy conspiracy theorists &apos; were actually right .
 those serve to prove the point rather than refute it .
 those were widely known about before they were officially revealed and even a lot of the snowden stuff was theorized .
 given enough time everything comes to light .
 when you start looking at that stuff compared to 9/11 or flat earth you have to see the formula .
 the more complexity and people involved the less time it can ever remain a secret .
  i &apos;m sure there are plenty of super shitty things that our governments are involved but we can at least rest knowing they &apos;re comparatively low key .
 it &apos;s like there is no illuminati but do the hyper rich attempt to influence politics on a global scale to gain more money/power .
 it &apos;s a lot easier to think of the world as no more complex than a long-running tv show .
 the deep state is deeper than we thought .
 at that point ,  the hard core conspiracy theorists tend to just shrug and blame the jews .
  to this day ,  i don &apos;t understand why .
 the prophets lied to us !
 you believe in bajor ?
 it &apos;s all a series of holograms the cardassians put up to fool the federation .
 it doesn &apos;t exist .
 teeth ,  knees ,  spine ,  hips ,  ankles .
 and people are upset about cyberpunk smh smh
 i grew up very catholic .
 my mom would always tell me we were very oppressed etc .
 it was always the opposite in reality .
 the church has had many freedoms from government interference and has gotten away with coverups for far too long .
 i &apos;ve always thought some of the models flat earthers come up with are actually kind of clever (not from a grown ass adult ,  but if a kid explained it to me i would be like  &apos;hey ,  that kind of almost works ,  not bad !
 but sunsets are always where they break down and just start saying  &apos;optical illusion &apos; over and over again until it &apos;s just gibberish .
 but what if you just teleported from edge to edge without knowing it .
 gotta love how the jews even get blamed for the earth being round .
 can those people ever catch a goddamn break ?
 damn ,  y &apos;all are on a roll !
 it is the side effect of maturity and foresight/hindsight .
 obviously one should not ignore personal growth because it makes you feel bad on occasion ,  but it does suck in the moment .
 i feel like it gets better with time though .
 to be fair they are all pro 2d .
 eat bed get splinters
 yes ,  basically; because they also think antarctica is a big ice wall around the edge .
 i dunno i think it fell a little flat
 i don’t believe anyone is beyond help ,  but evidently ,  some aren’t worth the time .
 most governments can &apos;t stop people from walking across relatively short borders ,  but they managed to hide the drop into the void the length of that flat world &apos;s circumference .
 if they can do that ,  why doesn &apos;t nasa hide russia from russians for their next trick ?
 flat eartherism is the king grand daddy of all conspiracy theories .
 just think about it ,  in order to really believe that the earth is actually flat you have to also be willing to go along with nearly every other major conspiracy out there .
 shadow governments ,  the illuminati ,  lies from big tech ,  nasa ,  all scientists everywhere ,  and on and on .
 flat earthers will believe basically anything .
 this is how qanon spread .
 they &apos;d slide into antivax moms or flat earth facebook groups ,  already target rich environments full of marks .
 its like the email scans ,  they &apos;re intentionally full of misspellings and stuff for just that reason
 new conspiracy: moon landing conspiracy theorists started off as a soviet psyops to devalue the american achievement while the soviets could get credit for being good losers
 not just the moon landings ,  but everything leading up to them as well would have to be faked .
 there is a reason that apollo 11 was the first to land .
 apollos 8 and 10 orbited the moon and came back .
 apollo 1 had the terrible tragedy that cost the lives of 3 astronauts .
 and before that were the mercury and gemini projects .
 we have the best aliens ,  folks .
 i &apos;ll always believe the reason he started space force was because they started to tell him and he flipped the fuck out .
 they pulled back on it and just made sure that space force was something more palatable to the public .
 also ,  covid gave them a great opportunity to halt any real resources going to it .
 lastly ,  when the pentagon came out and confirmed the legitimacy of the air force ufo videos in april of 2020 i think that was another way of getting ahead of trump saying something wild af and scuttling the issue entirely .
 if conspiracy was a drink ,  the mj conspiracy would be diet dr .
 this one is actually believable because his gambling habits are well documented .
 and who doesn &apos;t enjoy 10gs for the 30 minutes between here and their destination of choice ?
 all those  &apos;people &apos;that  &apos;died &apos; ?
 the whole purpose of the nsa was basically a conspiracy theory that got people laughed at for years
 it &apos;s like there is no illuminati but do the hyper rich attempt to influence politics on a global scale to gain more money/power .
 this is why q-anon is shit .
 the illuminati ,  if they existed ,  could not be kept a secret .
 but the super rich having outsized influence ?
 that &apos;s real because money keeps politicians distracted and doing things for lobbyists and large donors .
 the cold war was a lie .
 the us and russia are one nation ,  using our rivalry as an excuse to go to war with random countries .
 obama contacted putin requesting a specialist force to hijack a few airplanes and crash them into the towers ,  while us spies planted flame accelerant in the buildings to be struck .
 that &apos;s how the jet fuel could melt steel .
 the space race was just a cover to develop missile technology .
 the true goal was send a payload under the disk to have it travel to the other edge undetected .
 you can tell this is all true because trump wasn &apos;t very good at hiding his service to putin .
 they were using his presidency to test their mind-controll system after the chem-trail mind control failed (only half of us worship trump) they put microchips into covid-19 and use 5g towers to control them ,  but a chinese scientist discovered it and hacked it to make us sick insted of controlling us .
 the vaccine undoes the hack .
 am i missing any conspiracies ?
 oh yea ,  the aliens in area 51 were sent to liberate humanity ,  but were defeated by the lizard people ,  they are now our prisoners ,  and we need to free them to gain our liberty and join the galactic republic .
 may the prophets forgive your blasphemy .
 are you saying ,  it &apos;s a faaaaaaaaaake ?
 they also can &apos;t have both solar eclipses and lunar eclipses .
 why fly many miles ,  when few do trick ?
 if they are from america and they think america is on the edge of the flat earth and japan is on the other they probably think they they &apos;d die if the fly over the pacific ocean .
 but flying over the pacific ocean is quicker than flying over the atlantic ,  europe africa and asia
 imagine drawing a line from a location to japan on the un symbol and on a spherical globe and you’ll see the shortest paths are different
 flying from california is quicker then flying from new york
 like all i did was wake up this morning ,  what the hell .
 what can i say i &apos;m glad everyone came around
 y &apos;all got quite the big balls to say all this .
 five more words; two that are in spanish .
 one is a proper noun .
 i know i &apos;m asking for an explanation of something completely illogical ,  but .
 why would it be cold around the edges and in the center ,  with just a circular ring of warmth ?
 yeah ,  it &apos;s pretty much a sign that your mind is free real estate .
 you don &apos;t even need to be broken down ,  you &apos;ve broken off from consensus reality .
 pretty sad ,  honestly .
 you &apos;re describing my brother perfectly .
 we exclusively connect over video games now .
 flat earthers will believe basically anything .
 everything but a well rounded planet earth .
 that has to be absolutely exhausting to live like that .
 i personally think the  &apos;shapeshifting lizard people &apos; are just slightly more far fetched than flat earth .
 only slightly mind .
 slide into antivax moms .
  &apos;we &apos;ll let you pretend to be the first man in space if we get to pretend to be the first on the moon &apos;
 this is the least conspiracy theory i &apos;ve read today .
 that &apos;s double the covid .
 my skin crawled .
 thanks for that .
 everyone on bajor is a hologram except you
 bear with me for a second .
 i &apos;ll play devil &apos;s advocate .
 what if you take the flat disk and then warp it a little ,  downwards ,  so that it &apos;s more of a mound kind of shape .
 actually let &apos;s go all the way and bend the edges until they wrap back around and touch at the bottom .
 solar eclipses ,  lunar eclipses ,  time zones .
 lunar eclipses are scheduled moon maintenance .
 today &apos;s the day smoking is gonna save lives .
 you go see world ?
 in japan ,  heart surgeon .
 one day yakuza boss need new heart .
 i do operation .
 yakuza boss die .
 yakuza very mad .
 i hide fishing boat .
 come to america .
 no english ,  no food ,  no money .
 darryl give me job .
 now i have house ,  american car and new woman .
 darryl save my life .
 i kill yakuza boss on purpose .
 i good surgeon .
 r/decreasinglyverbose  for those wondering .
 apparently its actually a reference to the office ,  my mistake
 which begs the question: do these people think that direct flights from the us are fake a la truman show or do they think untold thousands of flights fall off the edge of the earth every year killing millions of people ?
 this thread is getting quite edgy
 dos tres hamster eat bed
 because they think the sun orbits in a circle over the  &apos;equator &apos; at a few hundred miles above us .
 it &apos;s pretty much a sign that your mind is free real estate .
 thanks for the chuckle .
 in all seriousness though ,  i used to be mormon .
 so that means believing that god lives on kolob and that my underwear must be as he asks and that i better never touch myself .
 i believed that .
 in fact i converted as an adult .
 and yet i never believed in a flat earth because that was just nonsense .
 point being; i was clearly gullible .
 but that didn &apos;t mean my mind was free for the taking .
 not really sure why .
 i looked at others like they were fools .
 i think it &apos;s probably comforting .
 instead of accepting that life is chaotic and there &apos;s often no real discernible reason (that a human can parse) behind most things that happen ,  you can instead believe that a great cabal runs the world and is controlling the flow of information ,  making people believe the earth is round for funsies .
 which is actually kind of hilarious ,  because such people do exist ,  but they &apos;re not secret illuminati freemason lizards promoting the great ovoid conspiracy .
 they &apos;re billionaires that buy laws and buy public opinion to give themselves tax breaks so they can buy more laws (and islands) .
 no need for obscure references; the panama papers and simple paper trails show this already ,  and buying politicians is legal in the us - it &apos;s just called lobbying .
 you can bet most of these flat earthers would trip over themselves defending jeff bezos exploiting his warehouse workers to literal death ,  which proves his money towards buying their opinion was well spent indeed .
 as insane as they are ,  at least you can &apos;t totally 100% prove that shapeshifting reptilians don &apos;t exist .
 i watched a flat earth documentary and even after they capital p proved ,  themselves ,  that the earth was a sphere they still convinced themselves it was flat .
 uh oh ,  this is rock solid logic .
  thank louise fletcher ,  who played a character so reprehensible that most people don &apos;t realize that she was only in nine episodes out of 150 in the first six seasons .
 even with the final season ,  she was only in 15 of 176 across the entire series .
 i see ,  so the earth is a flat sphere .
 thank you for this ,   i &apos;m laughing so hard right now and my week has been shit 3
 see world  -  oceans ,  fish ,  jump ,  china
 we still don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying and it &apos;s taking too long to explain yourself .
 read this as decreasing lyverbose and thought it was some strange sickness
 nah ,  it got rather flat fairly quickly tbh .
 could it have been based on the people who introduced you to mormonism and their importance in your life ?
 if someone i’m madly in love with tells me god is a purple parakeet ,  i might not take them at their word ,  but i might be just willing enough to start considering it .
 while ,  on the other hand ,  if some rando on the bus is yelling about how god is a yellow starfish ,  i’m much more likely to be like “yikes bro hope you get some help .
 that make sense ?
 you are right ,  that cannot be proven .
 you win ,  flat earthers are back to the top of my stupid list haha
 well i mean ,  not at the height of the cold war .
 new theory ,  the cold war was just a conspiracy to make the public believe that russia and the us wasn &apos;t getting along so the word wouldn &apos;t know about their time traveling dinosaur they were working on at the time .
 i was picturing more of a reverse halo ring .
 when i president ,  they see .
 i guess i &apos;ll bounce then .
 make it a holiday and have voting last either a week or a 24 hour period so people deemed  &apos;essential workers &apos; can actually have a chance .
 serious question: are elections in the us not on sundays but on regular working-days ?
 i feel like it &apos;d encourage more people to actually vote .
 especially if they kept their 4th of july energy for that day
 in australia it’s on a weekend but polling stations are open earlier in the week so you can go earlier if you are working .
 but people like to go on the day so you can get your democracy sausage
 actually coming from another country ,  i really cannot understand ,  why it should not be a holiday or a sunday (where most people have time) .
 as a democratic country you should enable most of your citizens to be able to vote .
 and that is generally the case when they have time to vote .
 i &apos;d work just like i work every holiday .
 we have a general election this year and i am working it as a polling place manager .
 we have voting on a saturday and this year because of covid they &apos;re opening some of the voting places the saturday prior also .
 for 2 weeks leading up to the elections you can cast a special vote ,  so there are plenty of opportunities and no one has to miss out .
 in fact this year ,  for the first time ,  you dont even have to be enrolled to vote .
 you can enrol and vote at the same time .
 i cant believe america has an election on a tuesday .
 that &apos;s absolutely insane !
 not only should it be a public holiday for you but companies should be legally required to release staff (if they are working) in order for them to be able to vote .
 at best it would be akin or presidents day or labor day .
 office and bank workers would probably have the day off but some jackwagon would get it in their mind to start promoting  &apos;voting day sales &apos; so the majority of the retail workforce wouldn &apos;t get the time off and would probably reduce voter turnout .
 vote by mail then it wouldn &apos;t need to be a holiday .
 biggest problem with a holiday is that at best only office workers would get the day off .
 not blue collar ,  fast food ,  customer facing services .
 min wage workers .
 it also doesn &apos;t address lack of polling stations in some counties .
 experience: 20 years voting by mail in oregon .
 wouldn &apos;t making election day a federal holiday create demand for service industry folks and retail workers to take on more shifts/doubles as businesses hold sales and such to take advantage of all of the federal employees &apos; day off ?
 those among the most impacted by election day availability ?
 i would vote for more education on the correct usage of commas in schools .
 plenty of people still work on any other holidays .
  why would this be any different .
 it would make absolutely zero difference .
 i work a job ,  like many jobs that don &apos;t give a fuck if it &apos;s a holiday .
 we still have to work 365 days a year .
 and the thing is many poor people work jobs that you don &apos;t get off for holidays .
 but schools would have off so they may have a harder time balancing work and finding a babysitter .
 and with people having the day off it may be even busier for stores and restaurants meaning less ability to let people get off early or get a break to go vote easily .
 there is also an issue where it may give people the idea of yay a day off and instead of using it to vote they party ,  travel ,  do some type of activity or events and don &apos;t vote still lol
 it &apos;ll never happen .
  they don &apos;t actually want you to vote .
 i actually don &apos;t think it would increase voting ,  people would plan other stuff to do with their day off not including a vote .
 in the uk it &apos;s always a weekday but the polls are open very early and late so it &apos;s easy to fit around work ,  it &apos;s about access .
 would love it ,  and encourage it dude .
 it should be a thing .
 don &apos;t care ,  will have to go to work anyway .
 how would you feel if using unnecessary commas ,  was illegal
 people would just turn it into the same thing as most holidays and the working class which needs the time the most will be made to work .
  &apos;voting day sale ,  50% off store wide .
  &apos;get the voting day special ,  ribeye ,  lobster tail and specialty drink for 23 .
 we need mail in voting ,  more polling places that cant be shut down ,  infrastructure to help people get to polling places .
 it would be a holiday for white collar workers .
 retail ,  food service ,  and blue collar people would still be at work .
 there’d be no point
 i actually didn &apos;t know this until now .
 how can they even conduct election during a working day .
 currently ,  many voters ,  especially lower income wage-earners ,  cannot vote because they have to be at work .
 and it can take many hours of lining up to cast a vote .
 many politicians are against mail-in ballots ,  preferring to make voters take time off from work then wait in a long line .
 in singapore and some other countries there already is a voting day holiday .
 it would be awesome to see it in the us
 in india if the elections are on a weekday ,  organisations are instructed to either give a day off or give 4-5 hours off so that the employees can go vote .
 either ways a day off should be provided or someone like me might never land up voting in us .
 i &apos;d feel more like our government gave a shit about the opinions of the people .
 how tf is it not a national holiday over there .
 in india ,  it &apos;s a national holiday ,  even for students under legal age of voting .
 my state (nv) just kinda did -- we &apos;re offering all citizens mail in voting .
  and we got sued by the  .
 i &apos;d take the freebie day off work though
 the rich don &apos;t want the working people to vote ,  plain and simple .
 wouldn &apos;t change my life as a non-american ,  but i &apos;d be like  &apos;good for them &apos;
 couldn’t care less i’m british
 but it’s not enough  .
 as a low wage worker i almost never get holidays off ,  so while it would help middle class workers get to the polls ,  they .
 generally already could ,  the people who need it most would just be forced into working that holiday ,  same as the other 11 national holidays
 yeah ,  the biggest issue is that even if it was a holiday ,  that would only apply to federal workers and employees of businesses that actually close during holidays .
 there are tons of businesses that stay open during holidays ,  especially in the service industry .
 making election day a holiday wouldn’t do much good for people working in restaurants ,  grocery stores ,  movie theaters ,  etc .
 most states have early voting that lasts a week or more prior to election day .
 also you can request mail on ballots however that varies from state to state .
 in my county you can vote up to three weeks early 5 days a week 8am-5pm and saturday/sunday before the election at the board of elections office .
 that and anyone can request a mail-in ballot .
 i &apos;m not exactly from a major metropolitan area ,  so i thought this sort of thing was standard .
 yes this is a better idea .
 i worry that a single day holiday will just result in rich office workers getting the time and retail workers having even less time as it becomes a shopping holiday like labor day or something .
 danger is especially high for that that close to christmas .
 i think they’re always on tuesday’s
 in canada it’s always on a weekday too ,  but there’s a law that says everyone must have at least 4 consecutive hours between 8am-8pm ,  so if someone is working 10am-6pm ,  the employer must give 2 hours off on one side .
 in new zealand voting is on saturday .
 edit - both canada and nz have advance polling days .
 and results are not published until all voting has ended .
 in india ,  election days are declared a holiday .
 if you are voting to decide who governs you for 5 years ,  everyone should be given a fair chance .
 it &apos;s because of an archaic throwback to 19th century farmers .
 it used to take a full day or two for farmers to travel to the polling places; weekends were out because they went to church on sundays ,  and farmers markets were often held on wednesdays and thursdays .
 and because americans are stubborn and hate the tiniest bit of change ,  we &apos;ve been stuck with this for 200 years .
 the first tuesday after the first monday of november
 uk elections are always on a thursday and we don &apos;t get a holiday but i think the polls are open much longer than the us
 in india ,  the election day is a holiday ,  no matter what day it &apos;s on ,  i thought that every country did things that way for some reason .
 no ,  and in most of america ,  for anyone who is working class ,  sunday is a working day .
 i may be wrong on this but they’ve always been on tuesday because in the beginning of the country they didn’t really have an effective mailing system so they had allow a day for the votes to all travel and be counted so they held elections tuesdays because everything was closed down on the weekend (that weekend part is just a loose memory i have when i learned this so correct me if i’m wrong) so monday was used for traveling and the actual election was on tuesday .
 so yeah we have definitely progressed past the point of needing them on tuesdays
  &apos;let &apos;s vote on 4th of july &apos;
 i think the idea of making election day a federal holiday is well-meaning but so few businesses actually close on minor federal holidays like columbus day (and those that do like banks generally treat their workforce with more flexibility) .
 retail stores and other low wage employers would stay open thus negating the benefit .
 i think making election day multi-day (maybe sunday through tuesday) would help as people could find the time that worked for them .
 the idea that election day is one singular day was not what the founding fathers intended (though in fairness they didn’t intend for the common man to vote for president either) .
 the first presidential elections happened at various times in the various states from april through november originally .
 lots of people (have to) work holidays .
 this really only encourages people with office jobs to vote .
 food service ,  healthcare ,  manufacturing ,  etc these people overwhelmingly work through holidays .
 election day then becomes early thanksgiving weekend that fixes all the family arguments .
  &apos;honey ,  we &apos;ll take the day before election day off and go since that weekend with your parents ,  we can get back on tuesday and be back to work on wednesday and then we can spend thanksgiving with my family !
 and we can be home for christmas !
 i feel like it &apos;d encourage more people to actually vote .
 which is why republicans will ensure it never happens .
 you get sausages ?
 even more ,  in spain you can be randomly elected to watch and keep the track of the votes .
 if you do ,  you are paid and dont have to work the next day
 well for example here in the czech republic ,  they basically said that whoever is in covid quarantine will not be able to vote .
 this decision was not well-recieved of course ,  it &apos;s not democratic .
 by preventing masses of people ease and access of voting ,  you ensure that laws they would vote against have a better chance of passing .
 america isn’t really free .
 more people voting is bad for republicans .
  the poor would have an easier time making it that day .
  that &apos;s why they always complain about the non-existent voter fraud and then try to make it harder .
 it doesn &apos;t even need to be a holiday ,  for example here in britain we have voting stations absolutely everywhere and make it so you can vote from 7am until 10pm .
 there &apos;s really no excuse to not vote when you have that big a timeframe .
 sundays are working days for most of the working class .
 so are holidays if you work in food service ,  retail or entertainment .
 yeah ,  it will become a day for mattress sales and the people with the least access to voting  will have to work and still have the least access to voting .
 i’m not opposed but it’s not the panacea people claim it to be .
 my favorite self dialouge around holidays is  .
 “what’s a holiday ?
 oh right its a time of year where i get to work even more”
 yeah see this right here is the problem .
 in theory a holiday is a great idea but in practice it &apos;d only change things for a small amount of people .
 is the whole country going to willingly let essential workers take the day off too ?
 people don &apos;t like it when fast food restaurants shut down for christmas day in heavily christian areas ,  let alone letting everyone take time off to vote .
 and with the way people were reacting with businesses opening late with the covid situation i can &apos;t imagine this doing much .
 heck i &apos;m curious how other countries handle those types of workers on voting day .
  and the people who have no choice but to work on a holiday are mostly the same people that aren &apos;t able to take off work on a normal non-holiday tuesday election day .
  universal mail in voting makes the most sense .
  automatically register people as voters .
 send out ballots in advance .
 have post offices set up as pseudo polling places for a week or two prior to election day where anyone who for whatever reason still isn &apos;t registered or didn &apos;t get a ballot can fill one out and drop it in the mail .
 this would also go a long way to limit the media manipulation of the results as they start reporting the entire east coast off of 2% of the votes .
  how many people on the western half of the county end up not bothering to go vote when the get home from work and see certain results on the news (as someone that lives on the east coast this is a legitimate question i have) .
  that ,  along with eliminating the electoral college ,  would go a long way to vastly increasing voter turnout .
 mall naming a day a holiday doesn’t mean everyone magically has the day off .
 they are legally required to release them to vote .
 it &apos;s not insane .
 it is a perfectly rational system .
 just not from a perspective that values democracy .
 and those people off would be shitfaced by 10am and either forget to vote all together or vote hammered .
 yeah i work more on federal holidays because suddenly every white collar office worker has the day off and wants to go shopping .
 if it was a holiday i’d pretty much not be able to vote since i’d be at work all day ,  when currently i just go in the early morning before my shift starts .
 meanwhile everyone in my family who has an office job that closes on federal holidays has always been able to leave the office in the middle of the day to go vote anyway and then just return to work .
 perhaps mail in voting can remedy this for most people ,  but personally i just don’t mail things that often so i’d be paranoid that i made a mistake and my vote didn’t count .
 when i vote in person my polling place has a machine that you immediately scan your ballot into in any direction ,  so you know it’s there and accounted for .
 the only other thing i can think of is that there isn’t just one election day .
 there are multiple elections and primaries - for example ,  i am casting my ballot today in wa for a primary and a special election .
 vote by mail is where it’s at .
  &apos;hey reddit how do you feel about getting rid of tipping and paying servers a decent wage instead  ?
 seriously ,  might as well have asked “would you like 1 billion dollars” ?
 the answer to both is a unanimous “yes ,  but it’s not going to happen” .
 the main subs on this site are basically all the same thing — boring reinforcement of the safe middle .
 line of vanilla content .
 anything interesting is immediately locked with ,  “you guys can’t behave” .
 i am a dissenting opinion .
 i don’t think it’ll help at all .
 white collar people get a day off ,  they in turn use retail and service industries more on their holiday ,  and retail and service remain open like they always do .
 not to mention emergency and hospital workers .
 can’t just send the whole staff home .
 r/askreddit is actually r/unpopularopinion ?
 always has been .
  &apos;would you gently slap your friend in the face for 8 billion dollars ,  your own private island ,  and all the pizza you can eat ?
 in my country it is a holiday ,  and the voting stations are open from 7am until 9pm .
 i also think (but stand corrected) that employers must allow their employees an opportunity to vote .
  &apos;election day mattress blowout sale !
  &apos;we &apos;re going to rent a cabin in the mountains for election day weekend .
 it &apos;ll never happen .
 they don &apos;t actually want you to vote .
 its just that they just want the  &apos;right &apos; people to vote .
 but not the poor ,  the black ,  the working class ,  etc .
 in america ,  every day is a working day .
 we do it in the uk without much issue .
 elections are held on a thursday .
 postal ballots and proxy voting can be easily applied for in advance .
 polling stations are open from 7am to 10pm and you will live relatively close to the polling station .
 voting is on paper ballot so no it issues to get in the way ,  although there were stories a few years ago with stations running out of ballots
 when i was a cook holidays were just days where you worked more but for the same money .
 making any day a holiday doesn &apos;t magically give everyone the day off ,  just those in more privledged jobs .
 the exceptions to the holiday will still be low income service workers .
 i work on holidays even christmas .
 the world doesn &apos;t just stop because of a holiday .
 polls are typically open from 6:00am to 7:00pm in most states .
 what low-income workers are working 13 hour days on a regular basis ?
 why are the queues so long ?
 in the uk vote ,  most people &apos;s nearest polling station is usually walking distance from their home and the whole process takes maybe 10 minutes ?
 typically there may be minor queues but that &apos;s it .
 i &apos;m 100% for making election day a federal holiday ,  but it doesn &apos;t solve all the problems .
 we need a combination of a holiday ,  no excuse absentee voting available to everyone ,  and multiple early voting options .
 so does everyone get the day off ?
 here (uk) when we have a public holiday ,  most working class people still have to go to work .
 making election day a holiday wouldn’t do much good for people working in restaurants ,  grocery stores ,  movie theaters ,  etc .
 ie the people who actually have trouble getting time off to vote .
 the federal government could just as easily mandate that every employer must give each employee a set amount of paid time off to vote on the day of the election ,  be it four hours or whatever .
 but it doesn &apos;t ever feel like the us wants people to actually vote .
 9 states offer no early voting & not all allow no-excuse absentee voting .
 that needs to be fixed ,  imho .
 for federal elections it should be a federal mandate .
 that way states that are run by a majority one party will have less power to alter election rules and disenfranchise voters .
 in a normal election (non covid) in milwaukee wi ,  you can start voting up to 4 weeks before the election day .
 we have elections on sundays and vote by mail if you order the papers before the election .
 this is to make it easier for most working people to vote .
 if the us allways does it on tuesdays (together with the big fuzz against mail voting) this sounds like a sceme to prevent the working people from voting .
 so a free day for votes might be good for you .
 would be interresting to see what changed if the working people would have a chance to actually participate in elections with lage numbers .
 in australia we vote on saturdays .
 you can also vote by mail or vote early in person .
 there &apos;s rarely a queue and we even have sausage sizzles at our polling centres .
 i love that you never have to worry about how to vote or if you &apos;ll have time .
 it &apos;s so easy to just rock up .
 you don &apos;t even need id - you give your name and address and declaration that you haven &apos;t voted yet in that election .
 then they cross your name out in their book .
 also criminals and those with criminal records can vote .
 there &apos;s no voter suppression at all .
 gone with the wind ?
 that is patently insane .
 australian elections are on weekends ,  you can vote ahead of time at early voting centres and you can mail-in vote if you’re out of the country or can’t vote in person .
 the only reason a developed country would do otherwise is if they are trying to suppress votes .
 actually ,  this year in nz voting is from the 5th september to the 19th .
 why would you have a single day ?
 we have early voting too in canada .
 basically fewer polling stations are open in the week running up to election day and you can go in person .
 you just see what the closest one to your location is and what their opening hours are (on the elections canada website) .
 it &apos;s usually evenings .
 we have mail in too ,  obviously .
 i &apos;d also so prefer if election day was a national holiday .
 or if we can have online voting (i mean we can pay our taxes online) .
 it’s actually because the fewer people that vote ,  the easier it is for politicians as they have to campaign a bit less and convince fewer people .
 if voting in the us was in a holiday or weekend (as it should be) the american people would have more sway as more of them would vote .
 what &apos;s the purpose of it not being the first tuesday of the month ?
 do you not want it to ever be a voting day on 1st november ?
 in israel as well ,  election day is a holiday .
 otherwise it just seems like a way to gather the opinion of the well-off and ignore the working class .
 hmm ,  maybe the american system is indeed functioning as planned .
 damn the freedom country sucks after all .
 no way people are giving up a day of barbecue and beer drinking to go stand in line and poke at a voting machine .
 while i feel this makes the most sense since everyone has a stiffy for merica that day ,  much of the population travels to family that day(s) .
 july 3rd election day (or friday if a weekend .
 ) july 4th “celebrate” the result .
 america wasn &apos;t even technically born on the 4th of july
 no ,  businesses continue like normal on voting day and most holidays .
 we don’t get it as a holiday in canada either ,  i actually once got in shit for voting on my lunch break during work ,  and i worked in a salaried position with a work phone strapped to me at all times .
 i don’t need to be in the office dammit .
 us holidays are not mandatory for non-federal jobs .
 in fact vacation/sick leave is not mandatory either .
 just like most nations of the developed world .
 and it would make us voting resemble democracy ,  if only a little bit .
 (apart from the fact that the donations of private interests groups finance the completely unregulated campaigns .
 that is so laughably fucked up ,  my eyes start to water .
 yeah ,  i think a lot of people forget that a holiday is not a holiday for everyone .
 generally the lower class does not get holidays off because of the types of jobs they work .
 i &apos;m required to work weekends and holidays excluding christmas day ,  i highly doubt we &apos;d get a day off to vote .
 that being said ,  it &apos;s illegal not to let your employees go vote ,  but that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;ll get paid for the time you &apos;re standing at the polls .
 shit ,  if they just made it a four day effort from saturday through tuesday it would solve so many logistical issues for so many fucking people .
 some people work weekends .
 some people work weekdays .
 everyone deserves a chance to get in there without sacrificing their job or schedule .
 you &apos;d still see a bunch of lazy assholes showing up last minute on tuesday ,  but at least we wouldn &apos;t be trying to cram every single person in the county into the building in one day .
 there is no way to fully close the country ,  but having a paid holiday to go vote would still open the opportunity up to a lot of people that currently aren &apos;t able to go vote .
 however ,  even for the people who can take the day off now ,  they can still spend all day in line to vote ,  which is ridiculous .
 i feel a better option would be widespread mail-in voting or a full week or two to cast ballots .
 any additional voting is good .
  getting those office people to vote is a worthwhile endeavor .
 if you treat it like christmas day ,  where stuff either isn &apos;t open ,  or has limited hours ,  that would help those other workers be able to vote .
 okay ,  but no one really cares about state holidays .
 i don &apos;t know of a single one other than my state &apos;s admission to the union (and i only know that because it usually falls on halloween) ,  and i &apos;ve lived here over twenty years .
 if election day were a federal holiday on the level of the july 4th then a significant majority of people would have the day off work .
 that would make a huge difference in voter turnout numbers .
 many of our polling centres are set up at schools or church halls ,  so the  &apos;parents & citizens &apos; associations and church committees will often organise a basic bbq and/or a cake stand .
 we call them democracy sausages .
 election day is on a saturday ,  though you can do what is called a pre-poll up to about 2-3 weeks before ,  you can vote out of area and you can vote by mail .
 our town of about 40 , 000 has about 10-15 polling centres opened from 8am until 6pm on the day .
 in france the people managing the polling stations are usually people working at the town hall ,  municipal councillors or people picked by the parties/candidates at the election .
 and if there are still not enough people ,  the first to show up on election day (always a sunday) are asked to stay for the day .
 in italy you can volunteer to do that (and you get paid)
 in spain you can be randomly elected to watch and keep the track of the votes .
 this mechanism occurs too at my country .
 it is considered more neutral and secure against corruption if multiple  &apos;neutral &apos; people is watching the voting process .
 same in brasil ,  but you don’t get paid ,  you get only money for lunch that day ,  and you get to skip work for twice the number of days you served the elections .
 also ,  our voting is always on sunday and it is mandatory .
 is mail in voting available in the czech republic ?
 can &apos;t they like ,  change it ?
 it was made on a tuesday so more people could vote in the beginning .
 it’s not a grand conspiracy ,  the law just wasn’t changed since it was seen as more convenient .
 same with proportional representation or whatever .
 whoever is in power ,  got in power because of the current system .
 therefore they &apos;re not going to change the system out if the kindness of their hearts to potentially end up losing because they gave everyone a chance to vote with a holiday election day .
 7% ,  gop won presidency .
 implying that the gop base isn &apos;t entirely poor people .
 the poorer you go ,  the more likely you &apos;ll see people voting red .
 what &apos;s a holiday ?
 -- airline employee
  &apos;essential &apos; is a term that &apos;s become relevant recently ,  but largely describes includes a ton of the (edit) people that work service-oriented jobs that ,  which can be genuinely essential .
 they definitely are the people with a lesser access to voting .
 taking off from work ,  at an hourly or tip-based job ,  means a loss of income ,  especially on a national holiday .
 grocery stores ,  gas stations ,  and major retail stores will all being scheduling shifts ,  more than likely not accounting for when voting centers are open and their lines .
 pandemic-essential services ,  and most of the entertainment/food/bev businesses that have been shutdown ,  it &apos;s all of those workers that will be left without the time to go out and vote .
 think about what you would do with a day off .
 get some groceries ,  maybe grab a lunch with some friends while you don &apos;t have to be at the office ,  vote ,  buy a mattress ?
  ,  and then start the night with an early happy hour while watching the results come in .
 the service sector will still be expected to work ,  and will be incentized to forgo voting if it doesn &apos;t fit in with their work schedule .
 unless individual businesses and/or major companies decide to delay opening ,  stagger shifts ,  or close for the day ,  many workers will be left out of the voting window .
 i &apos;m in full support of a voting holiday ,  and i understand that the country can &apos;t fully shut down ,  but as said above .
 it &apos;s not the panacea .
 an election week or vote by mail in every state would be the solutions that would actually make it easier for people to vote .
 i’m always bitter that i strain myself working on labor day to accommodate the influx of customers who have the day off .
 you get everything by mail .
 and you can fill it out and send it in .
 that is how i do it myself because i am way to lazy to go there .
 but you can go and vote in person if you want to on sunday morning .
 here in india ,  you enforce all businesses to shut down as a whole ,  they cannot open before 6pm ,  if the employees have to report to work legal action can be taken against the businesses .
 in spirit ,  this will stop all sales and enable those with least access to voting .
 obviously essential workers are required and they have to report to work but otherwise rest of the businesses being shut down enables a huge strata of low access employees .
 in theory a holiday is a great idea but in practice it &apos;d only change things for a small amount of people .
 i &apos;d actually like to know who these people are who struggle to vote with the current guidelines but would be given a whole day off if it was a holiday .
 tell that to reddit every couple months when this post happens .
 according to reddit ,  adding a holiday means everyone suddenly doesn’t have to work .
 these people just want another day off work for themselves .
 the reality is that if you don’t work holidays ,  your company almost definitely already provides you the opportunity to vote .
 the people who have the hardest time getting to the polls are the people to whom holidays don’t mean anything .
 making election day a holiday would do almost nothing to help improve voter access .
 the real solution is to give people at least 2 weeks to vote and the option to easily vote by mail or in person , 
 at-will employment makes that legal requirement kind of a joke .
 that &apos;s something at least ,  glad to hear it .
 ok ,  it &apos;s not paid leave to vote which makes it a hollow law .
 back to square 1 .
 traditionally bars were closed during voting hours
 i &apos;ve always voted in states with mail in voting .
 it &apos;s actually totally okay if you want to vote by mail but you &apos;re worried that you don &apos;t know how to use the postal service correctly !
 you can drop it off as well .
 for instance ,  in colorado just about every grocery store has a ballot drop off area leading up to the election .
 plus ,  you &apos;re given a tracking number that allows you to look online at whether your ballot has been processed ,  so it would be very transparent if something went wrong .
 it &apos;s honestly just a wonderful system .
 let me know if you have any questions about what it &apos;s like to use !
 most places allow you to drop your mail-in ballot off in person at the board of elections office .
 see if that &apos;s an option !
 i &apos;m doing it this year because i don &apos;t want to vote in person during a pandemic ,  but also don &apos;t trust that the usps will be fully functional by the time november comes around .
 in ohio ,  the elections website tracks my ballot from when they mail it to me to when they receive it .
 he said the quiet part loud and the loud part .
 you know ,  say what you want about trump ,  i &apos;m really going to miss him making it so fucking easy to find the cracks in the system .
 he &apos;s like a klaxon for corruption .
 if only people actually did shit about the flaws he can &apos;t stop talking about ,  he &apos;d be the perfect beta-tester for american democracy .
 i love how they don &apos;t stop to consider  &apos;hmm if we can &apos;t win by making voting easy ,  maybe we should reconsider our platform ?
  &apos;reddit ,  setting aside his personal views ,  is anyone else impressed that tom cruise does all of his own stunts ?
 r/unpopularopinion is a contradiction ,  since top posts aren &apos;t actually unpopular .
 that &apos;s the reason why they &apos;re upvoted .
 funny ,  isn &apos;t it ?
 not just low income workers .
 police ,  firefighters ,  er workers .
 i work for an industrial gas company that among other things makes oxygen for hospitals .
 there will definitely be drivers making deliveries like that ,  and at least one technician on call for any problems with the plant .
  just another way to suppress the votes of the poor .
  just make voting day voting week .
 damn ,  most of them require it to be paid time off too .
 many states now have extended voting too .
  in my state ,  we can vote limited hrs mon-sat .
 up to two weeks before the election .
 how can you not find a time to vote with extended voting and the requirement for your employer to give you time to vote ?
 it &apos;s not long everywhere .
 takes no time at all where i live
 there &apos;s about 50 , 000 polling stations across the uk and it &apos;s geographically smaller than several us states .
 i don &apos;t know how bad it is in the us ,  but from comprehensive research of several entire minutes of googling ,  there &apos;s variously between a few thousand and a few hundred polling stations per state (with polling stations being closed like they &apos;re going out of fashion in states which skew poor ,  black and/or dem) .
 so you &apos;re probably going to be travelling further and waiting a hell of a lot longer ,  not just knocking it out in ten minutes on your way to or from work because the polling station is in the primary school down the road .
 that has been my experience in a major city in florida ,  voting since 1996 .
  never more than 10 mins .
 why are the queues so long ?
 as a non-american ,  this is also the thing that worries me .
 the problem isn &apos;t that voting day is not a day off ,  it &apos;s that voting might take to so long that you need a day off in the first place .
 it also won &apos;t solve the problem of voter suppression ,  just because people don &apos;t have to be at work doesn &apos;t mean that they won &apos;t want to find something more exciting to do than standing in a line .
 i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever needed a day off for voting ,  when i have to i do it before work and it takes at a maximum 15 minutes until i &apos;m out the door - the train is probably a bigger risk for getting me late to work by being delayed .
 in singapore it &apos;s a public holiday ,  but i did notice that many retail shops still remained open .
 (i suppose you could possibly make the argument that the staff might not be citizens ,  but then that &apos;s hard to prove .
 in any case ,  i believe employers will follow the law and allow the employees time off to vote at least .
 anyway ,  voting is compulsory in singapore and we had a 96% voter turnout in the elections just last month ,  so i would say it works .
 that &apos;s so crazy to me .
 in canada ,  we are allowed 4 hours to go vote during the work day ,  whether it be federal or provincial elections .
 at least in my job we are ,  and i thought that it was mandated everywhere .
 they don &apos;t want people to vote .
  it &apos;s easier to get reelected when only a small percentage of the population votes .
 they need to allow people to vote from home if they can &apos;t get the time off .
  there should be no restrictions on reasons for absentee voting ,  either .
 why not just early voting for the 4 weeks in advance ?
 for the confused ,  this is because the first of the month is often paycheck day and they didn &apos;t want employers to try and coerce votes .
 originally it was a scheme to make it easier for people to vote .
 the majority of people used to make a living in agriculture and since most didn’t live in cities but rather rural areas it would take 1 day to get to their voting place .
 sunday was seen as impractical since everyone went to mass and wednesday was market day for farmers .
 so tuesday was picked as it was seen as the most convenient option .
 the fact it’s in november also has to do with farm culture .
 spring and summer and early fall were seen as impractical since that’s when planting and harvesting take place .
 by november the harvest has been completed and it’s not yet harsh winter whether .
 so basically no it was not to deter voting ,  but now most people don’t work in agriculture and i agree that it needs to be updated .
 if the us allways does it on tuesdays (together with the big fuzz against mail voting) this sounds like a sceme to prevent the working people from voting .
 apparently it was originally so that farmers could have time to travel in to vote .
 voting in canada is on weekdays too ,  but it &apos;s law that employers give you time to go vote during the workday .
 our elections in ireland are usually on thursdays or fridays ,  but the polling stations are open from 7am to 10pm .
 admittedly the land area we need to cover is a lot smaller than the us ,  and we make sure there &apos;s a lot of polling stations (they &apos;re usually in local primary schools) so realistically your polling station is never going to be more than about 10km (6ish miles) from where you live .
 or rather from where you &apos;re registered to vote; if you forgot to re-register when you moved house ,  or went away for college or anything then yeah ,  you &apos;re in trouble as you might need to get from dublin to fecking donegal to vote ,  which is like a 5+ hour bus ride (since most university students here don &apos;t have cars) .
 but i &apos;ve known plenty who do it ,  just miss their afternoon lectures to get the bus that &apos;ll get them home before 10pm
 our votes happen on saturdays .
 and you can vote early if you &apos;ll be out of area or unavailable due to work/travel/sickness .
 voting is also compulsory for us though .
 we would get a lot of pushback from the religious right about voting on sundays .
 or saturdays ,  just a different religious coalition .
 i &apos;ve been voting by mail for a few decades ,  my state sends my ballot automatically .
 i set it up once in the past ,  but this time everyone is getting a mail in ballot .
 this sounds like a sceme to prevent the working people from voting .
 welcome to america .
 we might end up with policies that favor the working people !
 while peering at you through my monocle
 it would be very interesting to see what changes .
 tuesday’s for voting just don’t make sense since the majority of people are at work
 you’d think it’s a way to keep the working class from voting ,  but it’s illegal for an employer in the united states to keep their employees from going to vote .
 last super tuesday ,  i woke up earlier than normal ,  text my boss i was voting as soon as the polls opened ,  and i would be at work as soon as i could .
 so if any of your employers tell you you can’t vote ,  tell them to fuck off .
 yeah ,  we also have voting on sundays and mail in voting .
 we also have(you might too) have the option to vote the entire week before ,  its just at far fewer locations .
 voting should be made easy for everyone ,  hell i would even support making it mandatory .
 it &apos;s also compulsory to vote so everyone gets a say whether they like one or not .
 also criminals and those with criminal records can vote .
 this bit &apos;s only partly true: prisoners currently serving a 3-year sentence cannot vote .
 australia really has a nice voting system .
 don &apos;t you have preferential voting as well ,  where you can rank the parties ?
 somehow the politicians still manage to fuck up the country though ¯\\\_()\_/¯
 no one going to make the joke that we have to give convicts the vote ?
 legit question ,  do you have people manning the polls the entire time then ?
 or can you just drop off your ballot somewhere ?
 over here in germany ,  we only have one day to vote ,  but you can request a mail ballot if you for some reason can &apos;t or don &apos;t want to go to the polls .
 plus it &apos;s always on sundays where everything besides emergency services and restaurants is closed .
 polling stations are everywhere ,  so manning them over more than one day would be an issue i feel .
 this makes so much more sense than one day !
 you’re right ,  this is actually my first year voting in nz and from what i’ve read and heard ,  the main election day is the 19th ?
 i didn’t realise you could just show up on any of those days ,  but now that i think about it ,  canada has advance polling days as well and you can just show up like it was the actual election day ,  although most people vote on the actual election day .
 so totally makes sense .
 in canada we have early voting days available- several of them .
 its just the final date for voting that you must be given time off work to vote .
 i always go on one of the early bird voting days .
 polls are usually open st most stations  from 7am to 9pm ,  so there is a pretty wide window to vote .
 i mean ,  a lot of states have early voting and mail-in ballots .
 you can vote whenever you want .
 in the us ,  how easy it is to vote depends a lot on what state you live in .
 you &apos;re both right .
 it started that way as a boon for rural folks to be able to vote ,  but has now been kept that way to keep different demographics from voting .
 access was the initial intention ,  restriction is the intent now .
 no ,  it &apos;s the reason above and it &apos;s pretty well codified .
  there &apos;s nothing sinister about the reason .
 not making that tuesday a holiday is the sinister part .
 there was already a law that it had to happen within the 34-day period before the first wednesday in december .
 there are laws saying that employers cant penalize you for going to vote in the states .
 although they should just make it a  &apos;holiday &apos; or a national day off like other holidays/bank holidays !
 the us has a lot of problems .
 but i’ve been to a decent amount of other countries .
 and even on sundays they had store workers ,  restaurant workers ,  baristas ,  city workers ,  bus drivers ,  train conductors ,  police ,  tour guides ,  airport workers ,  taxi drivers etc .
 i don’t think working on sundays is an american thing at all .
 maybe if they have a free beer and a sparkler instead of an “i voted” sticker .
 everything is possible with enough propaganda
 america was birthed from a giant bald eagle on july 4th ,  1776
 america was born over several decades ,  but the declaration of independence is seen as the document marking america &apos;s birth .
 the question is: were we born when it was written ,  signed ,  agreed upon ,  or ratified ?
 history began on july 4th 1776 .
 everything before that was a mistake .
 2nd of july was when congress voted to declare independence .
 they then spent two days on the wording .
 then the signing of the declaration of independence didn &apos;t happen until the 2nd of august .
 what state do you live in ?
 in ny your employer has to give you 4 hours to vote ,  whether that &apos;s you had 4 hours from polls opening until your shift starts or 4 hours after shift ends before the polls do ,  or 4 hours in the middle of the day .
 do other states not do that ?
 because business owners don’t want their workers to vote .
 i thought we were legally allowed to do this ?
 even as an hourly employee .
 pretty sure we would still get paid for the time it took to go and come back too .
 so my job used to schedule people who were underaged or said they weren &apos;t planning on voting so they weren &apos;t have to deal with it .
 or schedule the voters so they had time before or after work to vote .
 people forget because either .
 they’re in school still and don’t understand that people work on the weekends .
 legitimately think that necessary businesses can just close up for one day .
 i work in a hospital .
 it’s highly possible that i couldn’t even leave for 2 hours to vote even if i wanted to .
 figuring it out before work is the only way possible .
 make(and fund) our local post offices to be voting stations for a week leading up to the election .
 spreads out the people .
 it would also have to be a mid-week day .
 if you made it a friday or monday ,  people might go away for a long weekend instead of voting .
 if election day were a federal holiday on the level of the july 4th then a significant majority of people would have the day off work .
 that would make a huge difference in voter turnout numbers .
 those are not major holidays because the government made them so .
  they are major holidays because the people decided they were .
  there are a lot of federal holidays nobody but government workers and banks get off .
  the big 4 (christmas ,  new years ,  thanksgiving ,  4th of july) are culturally significant and that is what gives them that power .
  election day would not be that culturally significant ,  especially with the ease of absentee and early voting .
 what the hell ,  how does america not have  &apos;democracy sausage ?
  &apos; australia is now more american than america .
 its a pain in the ass if you got selected .
 but all the tables to votes have 3 randomly selected citizens that  .
 1) makes sures everybody only votes once .
 2) checks only one vote is insertes per person .
 3) counts the votes .
 once youre 18 you can be selected .
 you gain between 50-120 &apos;ish euro if youre selected ,  and you can opt out only for major causes .
 here you are informed days before ,  and if you dont show up the police will search for you .
 can confirm ,  a friend did this for the italian embassy in brussels ,  and was paid 200€ for 2 consecutive days of counting and verifying people &apos;s votes .
 your boss has to pay as if you have worked that day .
 the extra money is just nice
 or vote by proxy ?
 in the uk you can sign a form saying  &apos;i want this person to vote for me &apos; (like your spouse or whatever)
 people in quarantine will have no option to vote this october .
 luckily it &apos;s not that many people .
 (aside from that access to election places is easy ,  old/sick people can request to get vote collected at their place - but these are special cases nothing widespread ,  prisoners can vote in prisons)
 unfortunately ,  most of the people who can change it benefit from the way it is .
 it &apos;s always the same issues the people in power are precisely the ones that have something to gain from how it currently is .
 why do you think america has such a shitty education system ?
 the people in power know that idiots will keep voting against themselves .
 they could ,  but they don’t want to
 lol people think everything is a great conspiracy against them to make them specifically suffer .
 welcome to america ,  where 50% voter turnout is considered good .
 this is quite interesting because in germany many of these would be closed on national holidays .
 grocery stores and retail shops are closed on national holidays .
 schools ,  kindregarten and daycare are too .
 hospitals ,  some restaurants ,  petrol stations and alike would still be open but otherwise things all shut down .
 also we are usually shut down for mothers day but not fathers day ,  in an overwhelmingly male workplace lol
 one of the many reasons i &apos;m glad to have gotten the fuck out of the food/bev/hospitality business .
 the most soul-crushing shit is when those assholes come in and ask  &apos;why do they have you working on july 4th ?
  &apos; well ,  herschel ,  it &apos;s because assholes like you have to eat at a restaurant on national holidays .
 this would require a constitutional amendment which are nearly impossible to pass .
 it &apos;s also kinda different in india though because there are voting booths in every 2 km radius .
 america &apos;s voting system is inferior to ours in some aspects .
 a very small portion of restaurants and clothing stores would probably close or delay opening if they had cool bosses .
 maybe a few office workers with bad commutes .
 the fact that the guaranteed time off to vote isn &apos;t paid also makes it a joke .
 the people most likely to need that extra time to vote are also the most likely to need the money they &apos;d be earning during that time .
  &apos;you are released .
 don &apos;t come back .
 everyone keeps talking about the financial difficulties with losing an afternoon of wages and ignoring the fact that bosses will just fire you for some excuse .
  conservative bosses can fire liberals for voting and vice-versa ,  all they have to do is make up some bullshit the next day .
  at-will employment is one of the biggest problems in america .
 it’s at will that is the joke
 pretty much all laws about voting are state laws ,  since each state determines how it votes for its officials .
 not only do i not get time off .
 i would have to pay for a sub and prepare sub plans .
 we already knew the cracks .
 republicans haven &apos;t exactly been secretive about voter suppression .
  &apos;but he &apos;s just misunderstood and/or taken out of context .
  &apos; - my mother-in-law .
 even if that were true and he &apos;s just that bad at speaking ,  but still can &apos;t figure out how to shut up ,  isn &apos;t that a bit problematic anyway ?
 doing that would mean admitting that their underlying philosophy of  &apos;fuck you ,  i get mine &apos; isn &apos;t actually all that popular
 “fellow redditors ,  do you think that churches should be taxed like businesses ?
 i don’t know how it works for every state ,  but my wife and i always go to the board of elections and cast our vote (if we didn’t do absentee) like a full week before the election .
 ive never waited longer than 5 minutes to vote .
 in singapore ,  employers are legally obliged to give time for singaporean employees to vote .
 of course how employers do it is up to them .
 majority of the country is out voting for most of the day anyway ,  so it makes sense to shorten working hours .
 there are plenty of places in the states where your employers supposed to give you off for at least 4 hours to vote as well .
 unfortunately there are loopholes and even then they don &apos;t always abide that .
 and when pressed between going to vote or having not to because your employer is not going to let you you don &apos;t really get much of a choice .
 if they threaten to fire you it &apos;s not like the legal action is going to do anything to help you in time to pay your bills  .
 the best thing the rich have going for them is that the poor often can &apos;t afford to fight legal battles .
 awareness is a huge problem in general .
 most people have no idea when elections are outside of the presidential elections every 4 years .
 of course my state has no early voting or un-excused absentee .
 in germany i can simply scan a qr code on the voting invitation to order a absentee ballot .
 a lot of people who can &apos;t bus 50 miles on election day can &apos;t do it to vote early ,  either .
 there &apos;s some fucked up voter suppression in southern states .
 that &apos;s what he &apos;s saying .
 making election day a federal holiday is well within the purview of the federal government .
 it may not set any formal national standards ,  but it ensures at the bare minimum people will have time to vote .
 so we should have monday and tuesday off
 not sure where you heard that ,  but the actual reason is that catholics celebrate all saints day on november 1st .
 even though its not as big as it used to be ,  back then it would have been like holding elections on christmas .
 a lot of folks earning monthly paychecks in the 1790s ?
 for those with google ,   &apos;congress responded in 1845 by mandating a uniform national date for choosing presidential electors .
 i doubt if the concept of  &apos;paycheck day &apos; even existed in 1845 .
 i feel like that is a problem with a lot of laws in the u .
 they were actually well thought out in the beginning ,  but then circumstances changed and no one bothered (or dared) to change the laws with them
 this is also the reason schools have summer breaks .
 kids could help work the field in the summer .
 back in school once harvest was completed .
 still seems like a weird idea .
 in switzerland ,  voting day is on sunday exactly because of church .
 back in the day ,  people went to church with the envelope in their coat pocket ,  and after services they walked over to the school and dropped in their votes .
 because sunday was the day where farmers had to be in town anyway .
 yet another example of doing something  &apos;because that &apos;s how it &apos;s always been &apos; vs .
 actually doing something practical .
 it’s the same thing in the usa .
 employer must give you time if you need it to vote .
 in 40 out of 50 states there’s also early voting (typically on weekends) .
  many states also allow vote by mail .
 in most of the us it’s stupid easy to go vote .
  people just can’t be bothered .
 and the standard democracy sausage
 straya fuck yeah
 if not ,  that’s us anyway .
 i heard one idea to have voting on both sat and sun but stagger the hours so all timezones finish at once .
  then you don &apos;t have to worry about west coasters not voting at last minute because they like the projected presidential winner from the east coast
 maybe i &apos;m ignorant of something america specific here but why can &apos;t people vote before or after work ?
 our elections are on thursdays but most people manage to spare 10 minutes to pop in the polling station between 0700 and 2200 even if they &apos;ve spent a large chunk of those hours working .
 how does that fit with the right-to-work thing ?
 whilst they can &apos;t fire you for voting ,  perhaps you might be fired for a bad haircut ,  or looking at the boss in a funny way instead .
 it’s illegal for an employer in the united states to keep their employees from going to vote .
 people still living paycheck to paycheck ,  losing 2 or so hours of work/pay ain &apos;t helping anybody .
 yes ,  but it still discourages people from voting .
 and if they don &apos;t what are you going to do about it ?
 reporting them will get you fired for something else .
 yes also voting is compulsory for us so the voter turn out is always in the high90% .
 i really like out system of voting in australia .
 there are people present to check you off the rolls and hand you your ballot paper .
 only the advanced voting locations will be open for the two weeks .
 they will be staffed .
 this year there are 750 advanced voting locations and 2500 locations on actual election day (saturday 19th) .
 that &apos;s 30% of poll locations ,  most people should have one reasonably close to them .
 postal voting is available ,  but hasn &apos;t really been encouraged in the past .
 it &apos;s only intended for people who can &apos;t make it to the polls due to disabilities .
 but i hear they are beefing it up this year .
 there are other options too ,  including having a family member bring your voting paper to you and even telephone voting .
 email and fax are options too ,  it &apos;s all about finding an individual option that works with that persons disability .
 even germany ,  which is like the steriotypical country for americans being unable to fill their fridge on sundays ,  has open cafes ,  bakeries ,  restaurants ,  leisure locations ,  even some grocery stores depending on where you live .
 but depending on line of work there &apos;s things like extra pay ,  not being allowed to work the same people every sunday ,  restricted overall workhours ,  etc .
 a lot of museums will be open on sundays ,  but then be closed on tuesdays .
 working on sundays isn &apos;t an american thing ,  but the extend to which it is normalized ,  is .
 a beer/soda garden with hot dogs in which your  &apos;i voted &apos; sticker is the entry pass .
 well then i’m voting twice !
 look friend ,  we &apos;re not trying to bankrupt the us government here .
 we all know the supreme leader needs to keep his slush fund topped off so he can make sure those vulnerable and insecure billionaires don &apos;t get screwed over by the system .
 so yeah ,  before you go making a statement like that maybe try to see the world through the monocle of the true american superhero: the hedge fund manager .
 blm : billionaires lives matter .
 /s because i &apos;m not risking someone accusing me of of posting this non-ironically .
 you son of a bitch i &apos;m in .
 too much realism for this hour of the day .
 with 50 stars on it &apos;s flag from day 1 !
 everything that happened before that was a mistake
 but the stars were greyed out ,  and as we kept unlocking states ,  they &apos;d turn white .
 this is basically the  &apos;when does life begin &apos; question ,  but for a country .
 april 19th ,  1775 ,  we started gettin &apos; busy .
 july 4th ,  1776 was conception .
 june 21st ,  1788 ,  the united states were born .
 war of 1812 was our terrible twos ?
 civil war \ identity crisis as we hit puberty .
 world war i and the rise of america as a world-monitoring superpower - we get a part-time job .
 world war ii - we get promoted and now it &apos;s a full-time job .
 space race / information age / hippie era - college / drugs .
 we tried working a desk job in the 80s and 90s ,  but a workplace incident led us down a spiral resulting in such low self-esteem that we find ourselves now stuck in an abusive relationship with a pathological narcissist and ,  oh ,  dear god please let us not be pregnant .
 okay ,  firstly ,  thanks for the awards .
 it confirms my hypothesis that sleep deprivation begets reddit swag .
 and secondly ,  some of y &apos;all are taking this way too seriously .
 date it from when one framer of the constitution caught the eye of another one and said  &apos;hey bb let &apos;s frame &apos;
 the second day of july 1776 ,  will be the most memorable epocha ,  in the history of america .
 i am apt to believe that it will be celebrated ,  by succeeding generations ,  as the great anniversary festival .
 it ought to be commemorated ,  as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to god almighty .
 it ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade ,  with shews ,  games ,  sports ,  guns ,  bells ,  bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more .
 from a link someone else posted: .
 29 states have laws giving registered voters the right to take time off work to vote on election day .
 of those 29 states ,  22 require paid time off be given to vote .
 18 of those states require advance notice to take time off to vote ,  and 5 of them require proof after you have voted .
 12 states allow employees to take time off with no advance notice at all .
 election day is always a tuesday ,  so we’re good there
 and those holidays aren &apos;t that important to many retailers that stay open year round .
 i think if election day were made a holiday you might see a slight uptick in white collar voter turnout as some offices close for the day ,  but the vast majority of workers would still be working and struggle to make it to the polls to vote .
 an election holiday would be treated at most like labor day or even president &apos;s day ,  not like christmas (arguably the only day most businesses are closed) .
 it &apos;s been that way for as long as i can remember .
 i &apos;m almost 40 and i still remember going down with my dad on a saturday morning .
 it was weird being at my primary school on a saturday morning ,  but the sausage sandwich always helped .
 i moved to a town a few hours away about 10 years ago and it was a surprise to me that the closest voting place ,  a primary school ,  didn &apos;t have a bbq .
 it was the one and only time i voted there .
 when i found out that the usa they make you vote on a weekday and you sometimes have to wait hours to vote ,  that blew me away .
 that &apos;s not democracy .
 in peru is the same but you do it for free and some cookies and water they give you for lunch
 it &apos;s similar in germany ,  i &apos;ve taken part voluntarily in the past and actually found it quite fun !
 in germany you can volunteer for this (often employees of the town administration are asked to do just that) ,  and only if they dont have enough volunteers they draft .
 (but any person can observe the vote-counting process if they want to ,  without active participation)
 yeah it &apos;s pretty much the same in argentina .
 i actually volunteered to do it once ,  i was 18 or 19 and working part time at the time and it was about  half of what i &apos;d earn in a month for one single day so i signed up .
 it was hard and i was there for about 11 hours (voting time is from 8am-6pm and then the counting) but in the end it was worth it .
 also here the voting is on sunday and it &apos;s actually mandatory to vote .
 you can skip it if you &apos;re sick (you have to present a doctor &apos;s note) ,  if you are too far away from the place where you are assigned to vote ,  or if you are over 70 years old (you don &apos;t have to justify it) .
 i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s better ,  we definitely have our issues but i think if it wasn &apos;t mandatory then some parties might try sketchy stuff to prevent people (especially people not living in big cities) from accessing a voting space .
 that &apos;s not exactly true .
 24 of the 26 democratic candidates for president could’ve changed it if they were elected because they all supported an election day holiday ,  unfortunately biden is one of the two who wasn’t clear on if they supported election day as a national holiday .
 but generally democratic politicians want to change this ,  us voters just need to start electing people more progressive than joe biden .
 i’m still voting for him but in 2028 we need to do better for americans .
 it’s ridiculous and screams that they don’t research ,  and instead believe whatever conspiracies they here on the proven to be biased and unreliable mainstream news outlets .
 crazy world we live in .
 the conspiracy doesn’t make sense since democrats had plenty of time since the decades its been in place where they controlled all facets of government and could’ve easily changed the law if it was that simple to never lose again .
 japan and switzerland are lower for what it &apos;s worth .
 switzerland literally has national ballot initiatives too .
 that wasn’t the point of their comment ,  it was in reference to the claim that greater voter turnout is better for democrats .
 yeah the culture is very different .
 americans expect things to be open and operating .
 if i want ice cream at 2am ,  i can go to a 24 hour grocery or convenience store and get some .
 most all restaurants and retail don &apos;t really close for holidays .
 practically only christmas ,  but even then you can find a bunch of chinese restaurants or other stores doing limited hours .
 but it also really depends on what city you live in ,  how big it is and the lifestyle there .
 i lived in a small town and it was slow and thing all closed by 9 pm .
 people just closed down stores if they didn &apos;t get enough business and went fishing .
 in contrast ,  i lived in a major city .
 everyone is always rushing and i can always find somewhere to eat or shop .
 europe in general seems to be slower paced .
 that &apos;s unfortunate ,  for a country which is a mature democracy there are some absolute blunders that can &apos;t be resolved yet .
 i don &apos;t understand this and why washington d .
 can &apos;t be a state and no gun control etc but hey that &apos;s for our generation to solve hopefully
 i think overall as a voting percentage figure we still don &apos;t beat usa although we enable it .
 america has vote by mail and with the present government we can &apos;t risk to bring in that ,  first let &apos;s drop evms lmao ,  there is a huge way to go before our system is overall a superior one to america but it is possible .
 one year i was working two part time jobs back to back .
 they were not required as i only worked 5 hours at each and they weren &apos;t obligated to allow me time off .
 in my country your employer has to pay you time off to go vote (2 hours or more if i remember correctly) and polling places are in almost all schools and public buildings .
 as well as early voting and being able to cast a vote outside your district .
 all these to try and encourage rather than discourage voting .
 especially in states with caucuses or so few and understaffed polling places that you have to stand there for hours .
  &apos;he &apos;s not evil ,  he &apos;s just completely incompetent and stupid .
 that &apos;s why he &apos;s getting my vote !
 i know there are a lot of variances state to state .
  i &apos;m lucky i recieve a mail in ballot 2-3 weeks early .
 that &apos;s so brutal :(
 i &apos;m from the uk and have voted in maybe a dozen elections ,  in person and by post ,  and it &apos;s never taken me more than 2 minutes flat to walk in ,  vote ,  and leave; not to mention you can do it early in the morning or late into the evening
 thankfully texas has early voting .
 the polls will be open for in person voting october 13-30th they then close for a couple days and are open again on election day .
 all registered voters are eligible for early voting .
 texas may have issues but their early voting rules are pretty good .
 the problem isn’t just with voting ,  but general ignorance of our political system .
 most people can’t name the three branches of government (i saw 32% can name all three) .
 if 68% of americans are that uninformed ,  democracy cannot succeed .
 i don’t even remember learning about when the voting dates were in high school .
 you’d think a government class would cover that as many student are or will be of voting age .
 it should be required .
 when i was living in washington they would send me a ballot without me having to request it ,  which was as convenient as it gets .
 fill it out ,  sign ,  seal ,  drop it back in the mailbox for the mailman to pick back up .
 if i remember correctly ,  it didn &apos;t even require postage .
 they also sent a booklet with candidates &apos; personal statements ,  a list of major endorsements from outside groups ,  and arguments for and against each ballot question .
 now i live in new york ,  where it took an emergency executive order to allow absentee voting during the peak of the covid crisis when hundreds of people were dying every day .
 i remember during doug jones &apos; race ,  the gop called a bus full of black women ,   voter fraud .
 claimed they were coming in out of state when it was just a group that rented a bus and picked up those that didn &apos;t have rides .
 wednesday too ,  if you count the return trip .
 i thought it was on tuesdays to allow farmers the time to ride into town .
 in 1776 catholics were pretty much considered second class citizens .
  to this date we have had the same amount of black presidents as catholic presidents .
  i am honestly shocked that biden hasn &apos;t been attacked for being catholic yet .
 weren &apos;t catholics considered to be kind of sub-human by most of america at the time ?
 it doesn &apos;t quite add up to me that they &apos;d make such an election concession for a bunch of irish and italians .
 not sure what it was before that .
  thomas jefferson wrote that we should “provide in our constitution for its revision at stated periods .
 ” “each generation” should have the “solemn opportunity” to update the constitution “every nineteen or twenty years , ” thus allowing it to “be handed on ,  with periodical repairs ,  from generation to generation ,  to the end of time .
 ”  that’s one of the founding fathers .
 but now we wouldn’t dare change anything .
 daylight savings is a big one also
 it &apos;s a pretty common theme .
 i think it &apos;s more noticeable in the us because other countries are either older so they &apos;ve been updating their laws for many centuries anyway or significantly younger so their laws either aren &apos;t seen with the same sanctity that is often placed on laws in the us (particularly laws introduced by founders either as actual laws or embedded within the constitution) or are modern enough as it is .
 this is a frustrating aspect of real estate .
 america &apos;s zoning laws were made to fight industrial revolution development because capitalists were putting mills in neighborhoods (or neighborhoods sprang up around them) .
 it helped with that problem ,  back then .
 we made zoning so there was strict separation between residential ,  commercial ,  manufacturing ,  and agricultural lands .
 but times change and new problems crop up .
 ever wonder why the suburbs just seem to stretch on and on ?
 well ,  the neighborhood cannot have any non-residential construction so if you need a quick grocery run there &apos;s no corner store .
 you drive your butt all the way out to a supermarket (which these days sit at the front of suburbs like a gate) .
 but wouldn &apos;t it be nice if you could walk to a little eatery right in your neighborhood ?
 owned by a neighbor ?
 sometimes it is framed that  &apos;americans love their cars .
 we also love convenience .
 and cars can be convenient for certain things .
 but the thing about cars is ,  they are big .
 you need bigger-than-human-sized spaces to fit cars ,  so they end up taking most of public access space .
 also ,  it &apos;s dangerous to walk heedlessly around cars (because that inconveniences the car) so often people can &apos;t walk to any places anyway .
 how much more convenient would it be to have a market and restaurant in the suburbs ?
 to have lots of our communities have all the necessary amenities/facilities that are needed near enough to not have to use you car every single time ?
 how much closer would we actually be as people ?
 and that &apos;s just using how glaringly poorly suburbs were created separate communities just stuck onto preexisting cities via white flight .
 don &apos;t get me started on the city &apos;s more central properties and how those get taken by businesses due to 1) their age making them undesirable/too expensive to update for homeowners ,  and 2) the fact that their great location keeps their value high despite no one actually wanting to live in that particular house .
 now if we changed the finance so that the house isn &apos;t the equity asset but the land .
 this goes back to the phrase “if it ain’t broke ,  don’t fix it” i absolutely despise this phrase because people use it when they perceive any sort of change as bad and i know so many people who would say this if elections were changed because “that’s just the way it’s always been and it works so why change it”
 school year begins on september 15 despite children being replaced by combine harvesters and other heavy machinery .
 how many combine harvesters and other heavy machinery are in each class ?
 nearly 90 years later ,  in 2020 ,  school year begins on september 15 despite children being replaced by combine harvesters and other heavy machinery .
 i &apos;m now imagining classrooms filled with combine harvesters learning their arithmetic .
 bulgaria truly is an interesting place .
 i think you missed a pretty important part .
 things are way more spread out in the us ,  in the days before cars it could take people a full day just to get to their voting location .
 they couldn &apos;t just walk there from church .
 canada has advance polling though so this isn &apos;t such a big issue .
 when i worked retail i just went to vote a week before election day when i had time before work .
 sadly not all states .
 indiana ,  for example ,  does not .
 if you work 3 jobs ,  they technically do but you &apos;re still left without enough time .
 that actually varies state by state .
 a cake stall is usually pretty standard at a primary school .
 i don’t think anywhere else sells toffees in cupcake patties and a sprinkling of 100s & 1000s !
 with onion first because apparently someone can &apos;t hold on to their democracy sausage
 you have to understand too not everyone has off on saturday and sunday either .
 extremely long lines at the polls .
 to the point that you could be there for a couple hours .
 going to vote in america is crazy .
 you &apos;re not done in ten minutes .
 i don &apos;t know why ,  but there are often long queues .
 i &apos;m european ,  so correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
 you mean  &apos;at will &apos; employment .
 right to work is about unions .
 this is pretty much identical to australia as well .
 you should see what they do in australia on election day ,  no beer but they have election sausages from what i have heard
 how about we make it a 2-day holiday .
 vote on the 3rd ,  then celebrate america (or drink away your woes) on the 4th .
 i’m calling the police
 they’re just fake internet points .
 here have some of mine
 it &apos;ll be a cold day in hell before i recognise missoura !
 i don &apos;t know what horror america would be pregnant with ,  but given the state of things: congrats ,  it &apos;s (at least) twins .
 don &apos;t forget the great depression ,  where america lost one bet and suddenly everything in its life has no meaning or enjoyment .
 best comment so far
 i guess this is the mid life crisis then ?
 world war i and the rise of america as a world-monitoring superpower - we get a part-time job .
 world war ii - we get promoted and now it &apos;s a full-time job .
 1960 &apos;s til now - rest of the world starts wishing the us would stop thinking of themselves as the global arbiters of justice
 folks always seem to forget the articles of confederation .
 found out my state is only 2 hours .
 and to tack on to this ,  in some states the line to vote can sometimes take well over 2 hours .
 which is why is should be a holiday or be done by mail or preferably both .
 outside of the white-collar world ,  holidays are either meaningless ,  or sometimes mean that you work more than usual .
   even in more upscale jobs it would depend on the person .
  i would have it off (it for major financial company) as would my sister (works for the court system) ,  but my brothers would not (store manager for a regional grocery chain and security for a financial company) .
 there would be a push to make it monday ,  and the same people who currently don’t vote would use the 3 day weekend for vacation
 correct me if i &apos;m wrong but voting is also compulsory in australia ,  right ?
 if you don &apos;t vote at all you get a fine or something ?
 along with the facts you stated(the lack of sausages being the most heinous) ,  american democracy really is a sham .
 regardless of the blatant russian meddling ,  the amount of voter suppression and gerrymandering that goes on really is so undemocratic it really shouldn &apos;t be considered a real democracy ,  it &apos;s more akin to a plutocracy than anything at this point .
 i think they pay you but it &apos;s barely anything
 in spain you cannot volunteer ,  the idea is to be 100% random .
 i like the system tbh ,  seems fair and more trustworthy than if people volunteered (although tbh it should be secure in both cases) .
 i too  &apos;volunteered &apos; in norway - because they paid 700 dollars for two days of work .
 there is a difference between saying something to get elected and actually doing it .
 saying you want change is good for winning an election ,  actually changing stuff isn’t .
 change costs money ,  which increases taxes ,  which makes people unhappy .
 progress is something that is harder when it starts but pays off in the end .
 the issue is when the payoff is after the next election cycle and the only thing people remember is the hardship and not the payoff .
 making actual substantial change is not a super good plan to get re-elected unless your charisma is very high and you tie that one big promise of change to who you are as a politician .
 a good example is bernie .
 he is popular not because he wants to make big changes ,  but because he’s been advocating for those big changes for decades ,  even when they weren’t popular .
 this gives him a level of trust that simply won’t be given to a newcomer to the political scene ,  or even someone like joe biden ,  who’s political opinions seem less based on personal beliefs and more based on whatever ideas are more popular in the dnc at the time .
 it’s a laugh every time i hear someone call biden am extremist progressive  .
 like calling water too greasy
 but that’s supporting the point above you - the people who don’t want the election holiday are the ones in power
 yeah but switzerland citizens get to vote on every little change .
 if we only had one election a year ,  sure more would turn up .
 but i agree it &apos;s a problem
 also in sane countries voting  by mail is as easy if not easier than voting in person so you wouldn &apos;t even need that time off actually .
 meanwhile in the us you have to present a reason and might get denied your postal voting forms
 “can’t dems take a joke !
 the man has a sense of humor .
 telling people to drink bleach is sarcasm .
 he’s got my vote !
 us ballots are typically too long to vote in two minutes even if there &apos;s no line ,  but some places simply don &apos;t have enough polling locations .
 and that good redditor is the tragic flaw of democracy .
 now ask that 32% what each of the branches are responsible for ,  and what they are not responsible for .
 the number would fall to 10%
 they removed the filing fee this year here in washington so that vote information booklet was nuts this year .
 hmm i thought tuesday included the trip back
 i thought it was on tuesdays because the polling locations wanted to get two for one tacos after they closed .
 it’s actually because there only used to be six days in a week .
 jim davis invented mondays in the ‘70s so his cartoon cat would have something to bitch about
 not sure what all saints day had to do with it .
 catholics were mostly hated in the us up until the 20th century .
  &apos;every nineteen or twenty years &apos; and yet many members of congress have been in place for over 30+ years .
 not much change and revision happening there .
 that &apos;s a brilliant idea .
 it would be challenging to implement but you could have some mechanism for people to suggest new amendments and then every 20 years each of those amendments is voted on as a referendum as part of the election
 i wouldn’t want our current ,  corrupt government to write a constitution .
 imagine how much horse trading would go on .
 to be fair ,  though ,  jefferson was outvoted/outnegotiated on that point by other founders ,  most of whom favored a more conservative constitution that required cumbersome amendments to change .
 not saying tj was wrong ,  just that his didn’t end up being the prevailing sentiment among the framers .
 as long as we keep the fundamentals .
 like the 1st amendment .
 the 2nd amendment is there just in case someone tries to take the first .
 the 19th amendment allowing all citizens to vote is extremely important too .
 i’m all for freedom .
 and that always comes with a cost .
 the cost is usually death .
 “give me liberty or give me death .
 ” sometimes it’s both .
 i rather have daylight savings be here permanently and make that the standard to be honest .
 i hate how dark it gets in the winter .
 i can go to work before the sun is up and end up leaving the office with the sun down .
 i &apos;d say it &apos;s not because the age of the country ,  but more others have changed the type of government more ,  been more willing to throw out old laws and start from scratch .
 like the five or so french revolutions ,  then napoleon ,  then some kings ,  more revolutions and eventually modern democracy .
 all with it &apos;s own completly new constitution .
 the many ,  several revolutions accross europe ,  southamerica ,  africa etc ,  also completly changing laws to fit the new social standard .
 seen it throughout history .
 either change things when necessary or revolutions will do it for you .
 then ofcourse came the war and occupation everywhere ,  then the end of the war ,  basically starting from scratch again .
 while anerican have remained more or less the same for 240years
 they just need larger classrooms and teachers with experience in speaking unamplified to crowds .
 /u/mrangeloff &apos;s professor was outstanding in his field .
 in the uk much of the harvest was/is in august which is when the schools are all off .
 when i was a kid i lived in scotland for a while and although we went back to school in august ,  we had  &apos;tatty picking week &apos; in october (when the rest of the uk has half term week) when the older kids would go and pick potatoes .
 hell ,  in 1925 my great grandpa compound fractured his leg ,  it took them 26hrs to get him to a hospital ,  this was northern wisconsin
 why are there long lines ?
 is it lack of polling places ?
 it depends a lot on where in the usa you are ,  as each state determines its own voting regulations ,  and there will be variety in practical results within each state even then depending on locale .
  personally it &apos;s never taken me more than a few minutes to vote in person and my polling station is a three minute walk away ,  but in some places it can take hours of standing in line because of how few polling locations there are to handle the number of people .
 was just going to say this .
 election day in australia sounds like a mini 4th of july .
 although i would prefer to push the primary elections in the us more than the general (but why not both ,  honestly) .
 primary elections are the ones that no one votes in .
 both parties in my state put more effort into gerrymandering than anything progressive .
 and making election day a holiday isn &apos;t even that progressive .
 it &apos;s pretty much a basic as fuck requirement for a genuinely  inclusive democracy .
 i will recognize missouri ,  though .
 manifest destiny has always applied to all the oil reserves on earth
 twin presidents running the country but its danny devito and arnold schwarzenegger
 that was just it &apos;s emo phase
 that or terminal cancer
 i think this may be when we hit rock bottom before (hopefully) finally going to rehab .
 it requires more than just a small change .
  the states run voting at present and the feds would have to get all of them to agree to allow the federal government to take over .
  i am sure you might be able to do an end round in some cases like what happened with mlk jr holiday in forcing states to make it a holiday ,  but that would face court challenges .
 it absolutely would need to be done at the federal level .
 the primary owner of our company is extremely cool and you can tell he truly cares about his employees .
 we discussed what we could do to not only make it easier for people to vote but to encourage it and our conclusion was very little .
 we have sla(service level agreements) with our clients and potentially losing nearly 50% of our production for a day would not just cost us money paying them for not being at work(which we were fine with) but could potentially cost us clients .
 there &apos;s also the fact that at least a few of our bigger clients have made it quite clear they are full on the trump train so telling them it was because we were encouraging people to vote would increase the chance of losing clients ,  as disgusting as that is .
 it needs to be a federal holiday so clients know we have no choice and treat it the same as christmas or any other holiday .
 early voting allowances are a better option than a holiday .
  as everyone knows (who pays any attention) holiday ,  even federal ,  doesn &apos;t mean people are actually off work .
  while we are only allowed minimum 2 hours to vote on election day ,  my state usually has 2-4 weeks of early voting that also includes at least one saturday voting time .
  if you can &apos;t vote during that timeframe then a holiday you have to work on isn &apos;t going to change anything .
 in some states districts the line to vote can sometimes take well over 2 hours .
 it’s almost never an issue state-wide ,  but concentrated in urban areas where the number of voters per polling place is well above the mean .
 it’s going to be worse than usual this year .
 yeah ,  that &apos;s right .
 voting is compulsory .
 $55 fine if you don &apos;t and don &apos;t have a valid excuse .
 not sure what &apos;s considered a valid excuse ,  but i guess medical reasons would be the only reason i can think of .
 we get alot of invalid votes ,  or what is also called a  &apos;donkey vote &apos; ,  which can range from not marking any boxes ,  voting for mickey mouse or filling the sheet with expletives .
 i &apos;ve worked a few federal elections at polling centres ,  counting votes and post election checks .
 it &apos;s an interesting process .
 pays fairly well ,  though it is a long day .
 usually 6am on the saturday until around midnight ,  sometimes later ,  depending on how long initial vote counting and the polling centre end of day reconciliation and cleanup takes .
 we also have a preferential voting system rather than simply “most votes wins” .
 the way that works is ,  you can vote for not only your first preference but also your second ,  third ,  fourth ,  and so on until your greatest ideological opponent is placed last .
 that way if your top pick doesn’t get enough voted to be a serious challenger and is eliminated from the race ,  your 2nd preference will get your vote ,  and so on down ,  until one of your preferences is amongst the final 2 .
 this allows you to vote for whoever you like but know that the least worst option will still get your vote - and not feel like you are gifting your ideological opponent with a win because of a wasted vote .
 it allows for alternative parties to have a chance .
 it’s still got two major parties ,  but some alternatives do get positions in parliament .
 it’s not perfect - sometimes te alternative positions hold the balance of power and must be sucked up to ,  to get legislation through - and sometimes these are complete and utter whackjobs - but you could argue that’s the whole point of voting alternatively - to get a different voice heard .
 also if you only vote for your first preference ,  some systems such as our senate allow the person you voted for to specify the remaining preferences .
 this results in various preference-swapping arrangements that can sometimes see a senator with only a miniscule primary vote still voted in on 2nd preferences .
 in brazil they pay nothing .
 but only people who are government / public employee/ civil servant can be selected to work on election day .
 same in colombia ,  though you get a government ticket for a full day off anytime during the year ,  and one for half day off for voting .
 while that &apos;s true ,  you still have a better chance at getting a specific change to occur when voting for a candidate who claims he will change it compared to a candidate who already said he won &apos;t
 i wish biden was as left wing as fox and trump pretend he is .
 yeah ,  biden sucks ass ,  he &apos;s a senile old creep who wouldn &apos;t know a real progressive if they sucker punched him .
 it feels like a lose-lose in 2020 .
 but i &apos;d vote for him in a heartbeat over the current imbecile in the white house ,  because the democrats as a whole actually does contain some genuinely good progressive politicians .
 hopefully those people could flourish under a democrat government ,  and we &apos;ll see real change take hold in 2024 or 2028 .
 i know biden will likely run for a second term ,  but i &apos;m .
 concerned about whether he &apos;ll actually be capable of leading in 4 years .
 we urgently need some younger blood in government .
 even bernie ,  the most progressive option around during the primaries ,  is ancient .
 i just feel like the entire nation is being represented by 60+ folks ,  but that age group only makes up roughly a fifth of the population .
 not saying anyone older doesn &apos;t deserve a say ,  but the kids are alright and we should trust younger politicians more .
 we place a lot of value on experience but a lot of that experience just isn &apos;t relevant in today &apos;s society .
 you can &apos;t take political lessons learned in the 70s and 80s and simply apply them today .
 in india there was a hamlet in the middle of the jungle somewhere ,  and due to the election regulations ,  they had to set up a dedicated polling station just for one registered voter .
 i always thought that was crazy ,  but now i see why they have that rule !
 if you don &apos;t have enough polling stations in an area ,  you can essentially disenfranchise whole groups of people by making it practically impossible to vote due to long waiting/travel times
 i &apos;ve done the australian and nsw senate papers ,  which often have 100+ candidates to rank ,  and i &apos;ve only once had to wait more than 5 min to get into a station .
 my gov teacher in high school made us memorize a table of powers and checks for each branch and house of congress .
 i thought it was a waste of time ,  but it sure became good info with a president who probably doesn’t know the powers/limitations of his own office
 not if you &apos;re in line until closing ,  or even after .
 some station get mighty backed up due to being the only poll around .
 they &apos;ll never notice .
 i thought it was on tuesday because ruby tuesdays $5 salad bar
 why would they change anything ?
 people might start to think those positions should be changed
 it blows my mind that only the executive branch has a term limit .
  they all need term limits like 2 max 3 .
 who in congress going to vote for taking themselves out of power .
 just came back to say this is why i love this country .
 opinions and thoughtful conversation on serious topics .
 i personally just get an uneasy feeling when i hear of someone that &apos;s been in office for 30+ years .
 but again ,  that is how our system works and i fully understand that .
  even if the term limits were 10 years or however long ,  personally ,  i would like to see the end of lifelong politicians .
 not that they are all bad ,  but new blood breeds new ideas .
 and saying the next voted in politician would have no experience is not true ,  nor does it really matter either .
 sarah palin was a housewife that turned mayor because she spoke up about the corruption in her local government .
 she did so well as a mayor she won a governor &apos;s seat .
 political experience can come from anywhere .
 they only care about power ,  they don’t really cre about the constitution .
 this country hasn’t been what the founding fathers wanted for a long time .
 and the people responsible for that are often the people yelling the loudest about the founding fathers .
 liberal means ‘willing to part with tradition’ and thomas jefferson was as liberal as they come .
 i should clarify that last sentence .
 he was liberal by the standards of the time ,  not by today’s .
 but he was certainly willing to part with traditions .
 being in congress for 30 years isn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing .
 i mean ,  it absolutely can be ,  since it is easy to be corrupted .
 this is the problem with everybody loving term limits .
 they have term limits in michigan ,  and all that leads to is staffers and lobbyists who know how to govern and have relationships with other staffers and lobbyists doing most of the real governing .
 it &apos;s insidious and gross
 they change things to make sure their pockets get filled on the side .
 i admire the idea ,  but you &apos;re neglecting one simple fact - that process would inevitably be co-opted by the greedy & powerful as well .
 it doesn &apos;t matter what system the us puts in place; it will always be destroyed by assholes .
 it &apos;s also monstrously difficult to amend the constitution .
 there &apos;s a couple ways to do it ,  but either way you need a 3/4 majority of states to approve an amendment (and the  &apos;typical &apos; process also takes a 2/3 majority of both the house and the senate) .
 that was one thing when it was the 13 states colonies of new england ,  all of whom have relatively similar cultures if not socioeconomic needs but nowadays i have a hard time coming up with much that 38 of the states will agree on .
 as the us has expanded ,  states have very different circumstances with populations that prioritize issues very differently .
 america actually has the oldest continuously active constitution in the world .
  its a well constructed document overall ,  but it needs a serious overhaul .
 you &apos;re close on that .
 the only rights the federal government has are the rights specifically enumerated .
 often that &apos;s what the supreme court rules on when finding a law unconstitutional ,  declaring that the power was not granted to the federal government .
 many people get it backwards ,  thinking that the bill of rights grants citizens certain rights .
  instead ,  it re-asserts from the preamble that the government is only authorized by it &apos;s citizens to have specific powers ,  and broad swaths of powers are specifically reserved away from the federal government .
 but that &apos;s because days are shorter in winter ,  not because of daylight savings .
 perhaps rather than keeping daylight savings they should just make the earth rotate slower on its axis so that the daytime are longer ,  to solve your problem /s
 better solution we work less durring the winter !
 even the city folk in the uk used to head into the country in august school holidays to help out the harvest (hops in particular)
 yeah we also still have autumn school holiday here in finland in october just because of that reason .
 it &apos;s all rigged to discourage voter turnout ,  especially in high minority areas .
 name of your sex tape
 it forces you to show up and vote ,  or be penalized .
 what do they do ?
 that’s what they want me to think
 and all the other planets in the galaxy ,  we &apos;re heading to one of jupiter &apos;s moons that is said to have oceans of oil
 tbh ,  i &apos;d take it over our current situation .
 so ,  we get an upgrade !
 federal holidays are not mandatory days off ,  your forgetting that fact ,  some states had blue laws that meant companies couldn &apos;t be open on sunday ,  those laws slowly got overturned .
 bussiness keeps going 24/7 .
 in br they give you a meal ticket and some days off work (works like a sick day) depending on what position you are selected to .
 and voting are aways on sundays .
 part of the issue is that you have to be at least 35 years old to run as president -- there are some legislators out there who would be awesome in higher positions but they are too young as of now .
 and i think another piece is that there are a lot of old voters and they may be more likely to vote for older individuals who  &apos;match &apos; their interests (or at least say that they do ,  knowing full well the older generations typically watch news stations over researching) .
 we need more youth to vote .
 ding ding ding ding !
 voter suppression is a hot button issue in the us for a reason .
 most people by now know about gerrymandering but that is but the tip the iceberg
 some of them were in their twenties ,  but not most ,  and hardly any that most people have heard of .
 jefferson was likely the youngest most people could name off the top of their head .
 in 1776 ,  for example ,  jefferson was 33 ,  washington 44 ,  and franklin 70 .
 the average age for signers of the declaration was 44 ,  for what it &apos;s worth .
 that &apos;s not to say they were nearly as old as our current crop ,  so your  overall point stands (avg .
 age in congress now is nearly 60) .
  &apos;the people running our country now are in their sixties to eighties ,  and the founding fathers were in their twenties .
 i think it &apos;s a mistake to needlessly fetishize the founding fathers .
 that being said ,  madison and hamilton were far and away the youngest of the core  &apos;founding fathers &apos; ,  and most of the others were at least in their 40s by the time the constitution was signed .
 ben franklin was in his 70s !
 term limit sound nice ,  but without other major reforms could actually be bad .
 the president needs them ,  obviously ,  that &apos;s too powerful a position for one person to have for too long .
 but in congress ,  if you have new congress people every 2 years or every 4 years ,  then suddenly the only experienced politicians aren &apos;t actually elected .
 it &apos;d be lobbyists and advisors .
 that wouldn &apos;t be an improvement imo .
 who in congress going to vote for taking themselves out of power .
 the new people that you vote in .
 i used to be for congressional term limits ,  but i &apos;m not there anymore .
 having career politicians is not necessary a bad thing .
 if money in politics is not fixed ,  all you &apos;ll get is congressmen who attempt to enrich themselves as fast as possible before their terms is up .
 then you &apos;ll also have super experienced lobbyists ,  who don &apos;t have term limits ,  guiding inexperienced co congressmen on how the legislative process works .
 that &apos;s not a power dynamic we want .
 that definition is probably the first time it really sort of drove home what exactly makes liberal different from  &apos;left &apos;
 yeah ,  i think that &apos;s just every country .
 they all have their own problems and they all have greedy fucks that would sell oxygen if they could .
 the power of propaganda in the us is astounding .
 we are one of the most heavily propagandized populations on the planet ,  and honestly ,  during the reagan years ,  we would have had all sorts of awful shit baked directly into the constitution .
 other countries have systems that work better .
 why couldn &apos;t the us ?
 at least a generation was raised on  &apos;greed is good &apos; and was taught everything is disposable (take out containers ,  washing machines ,  cars ,  friends ,  houses) (except for term limits or the constitution) .
 if we continue to focus on global climate change (a problem made even worse by war ,  well maybe unless we kill off 60%+ of people) ,  a problem which can only start to be solved by working cooperatively ,  and get people elected who want to solve that constructively ,  we might be able to get out of this
 what &apos;s wierder is the bottom 38 states in terms of population is roughly 140m people .
  so the bottom 3/4ths of states could pass an amendment that affects 3/5s of the population while only directly representing 2/5s .
 the 13 states of new england ,  all of whom have relatively similar cultures if not socioeconomic needs .
 new england has always been the 6 states that it is today .
  there were 13 colonies though .
  they actually had ,  as today ,  different cultures and socioeconomic needs which is why it was so difficult to come up with a government that worked for everyone and included a series of compromises .
 one of the famous ones was after it was decided to have a house and a senate ,  northern states didn &apos;t want southern states to dominate because when their slave populations were included ,  they had more people and would have had a majority in the house .
  as a consequence ,  northern states pushed to have slave populations not count at 100% .
 one could argue this is one of it &apos;s problems .
 the average lifespan of any nation &apos;s constitution is 17 years since 1789 .
 i think if we can consistently update it as time goes on we would be okay ,  but as you said it needs a serious overhaul and i &apos;m fearful that it is almost impossible to do at times .
 sometimes i wonder if the us should rewrite it &apos;s constitution
 can’t we just permanently move the sun somewhere so we get more daylight ?
 where i am (ohio) in the middle of winter the sun rises at 8 ,  and sets at 5 .
 which also tend to be your typical working hours .
 if you had daylight savings year  &apos;round ,  you &apos;d at least have a chance to make it home before the sun sets .
 so i can see why people would like to have daylight savings year  &apos;round .
 my favorite work schedule was 6 am-3 pm for that reason .
 i don &apos;t think he gets it .
 if you shift it you can still see the sun either in morning or evening though .
 jokes on you ,  missoura don &apos;t think !
 ah sadly no oil in space yet :( we haven &apos;t spotted any other life out there for it to turn into oil .
 tbh ,  i would take a rabid raccoon over our current “choices”
 not actually such a bad idea .
 arnie has political experience and is a class act in general and ddv has a history of looking out for people (see mara wilson) .
 i &apos;d at least feel like the two of them genuinely want to do what they believe to be  best for the american people ,  and that both would defer to sme &apos;s as much as possible because they &apos;re not raging narcissists .
 “when america is dead ,  just throw it in the traaasssshhhhh”
 more like mosquitos .
 a bunch of them can bite you and you won’t notice until the next day .
 and by that point they’ve disappeared into the swamp
 the presidency didn’t have term limits until the 22nd amendment in 1951 .
 the tradition of two terms was established by washington ,  and the rest followed suit ,  until fdr decided to run for a third ,  and then after that term ,  a fourth .
 this is exactly the issue here in california .
  we have strict term limits for our assembly and state senate .
  what ends up happening is most of the influence and laws are now written by lobbyists and outside organizations .
  the politicians still make their rounds ,  they will jockey around from assembly to senate to basically dog catcher .
  their career is politics .
  i actually don &apos;t see a problem with a  &apos;career politician &apos; .
  just like any profession ,  you get a lot of expertise and experience .
  i would much rather see a limit on money &apos;s influence .
  i would say hard limits to money and only indirect influence on politicians by lobbying groups and publicly financed  elections and campaigns as well as ranked choice voting (here in the states) would go a long way to curing what ails us .
 the problem ,  as a general rule ,  is as people are in power longer they become more corrupt and more entrenched in maintaining the status quo .
  we absolutely do not need life long senators and representatives .
  further more ,  there is a huge pool of experienced politicians to pull from in each state who have spent more than a decade doing their job .
  there is and never has been any lack of experienced politicians .
 the senate was given a long term to help keep it from being unduly pressured by short term political items and with that in mind ,  it would probably be good to give them a 3 term limits (18 years .
 the house was intended to be responsive to short term political needs and needs elected every 2 years .
 to keep that same thought in mind ,  a limit of 4-6 terms (8-12 years) seems reasonable (over the term of a senator ,  but under their limit .
 that would still potentially allow a politician to get elected to the house for 8(-12) years ,  senate for 18 years ,  and serve 8 years in the presidency .
 that &apos;s 34(-38) years of being in politics .
 that is still far more than anyone should ever be in political power .
 well there are 2 types of states : .
 president first then parliament ( or equivalent) .
 or the other way around .
 both with advantages and disadvantages .
 were i live parliament is strongest but that means that getting rid of the parasites in it is just extremely hard if not borderline impossible .
 combine that with very long terms and lack of good and relevant choices and you are inbound for bad stuff  .
 unless you get more people like susan collins .
 she promised yo self limit her time as a senator and work towards implementing term limits as law ,  now she &apos;s running for a 5th term
 the new guys usually want to become the old guys
 liberal in a political sense really just means a willingness to take new approaches to problem solving .
 i think it gets equated with the left a lot because leftist policies are breaking with a lot of traditions .
 but yeah ,  they aren’t the same at all even though they can and often do overlap .
 other countries approach it by having more fluid bodies of government with multiple parties ,  thus avoiding most of the us gridlock created by partisanship .
  we can add amendments to our constitution at any time ,  but it requires a majority in the house and the senate and then ratification by state legislatures .
 or by a state convention ,  but that has never happened .
 it &apos;s intentionally difficult to change the constitution and intentionally easy to change the laws .
 no one really agreed with jefferson &apos;s proposal ,  which is why it didn &apos;t happen .
 way too much money in politics in the us ,  it &apos;s cheaper to lobby politicians to change a law in your favor than to work around it .
 theoretically yes ,  but that &apos;s why most constitutional amendments (to my understanding) go through congress; the house is supposed to stop any amendment that would disproportionately affect populations .
 i think it would be a smart move .
  except i don &apos;t know how we could possibly get a group of people to agree to anything even close to what we have now .
  2nd amendment is a hot topic of debate as is .
  we argue it all the time .
  plus if it conflicts any existing state constitution you run into more problems .
  its somewhat like going to the dentist .
  if you go every few years you &apos;re alright .
  wait 244 years and its gonna hurt .
 that &apos;s insane (from my american perspective) that other countries revise or replace their constitution like that .
 i think it &apos;s a good thing ,  to revise and look at amendments and truths of our constitution and helps keep the citizens politically involved (part of the problem in the us is lack of involvement and like muscles if you dont use them you begin atrophy of that function) .
 while i am not sure how much of a difference it would make culturally i think more significant legislative changes would make citizens feel more involved in their countries evolution .
 right now it just feels like a circus where you buy a ticket and hope the elephant doesnt shit on you .
 nah ,  i think what he &apos;s saying is that daylight time should just be the standard time all year ,  so trading an hour of darkness in the morning to get a later sunset .
 being that many people are at work around sunrise or don &apos;t attempt any outdoor leisure activities in the morning ,  an hour later sunrise wouldn &apos;t be a big deal and an hour later sunrise would be nice .
 a lot of us are basically at work around dawn and in the winter we are leaving work as the sun is going down .
 just natural gas oceans .
 (titan ,  methane oceans)
 then we make the oil ourselves
 i was about to say ,  what a fucking mass grave that would have been .
 telling users to kill themselves is a violation of rule 8 and will get you banned .
 what sucks a lot for non-celebrities and poorer people is the cost of therapy .
  i don &apos;t currently have insurance and while i know i should go see a therapist about stuff ,  i can &apos;t afford it .
 i &apos;m sure other people are in that boat .
 for me it isn &apos;t so bad these days because i ended up meeting an awesome guy and getting engaged ,  but i &apos;ve had a lot of extremely low points in my life where i could &apos;ve used professional help .
 as someone who &apos;s struggled with suicidal thoughts and still do on occasion i &apos;d like to advice against a trend i &apos;ve noticed on reddit ,  and it &apos;s this thing about instantly linking to suicide prevention organizations .
 i personally understand that it &apos;s ment with good intent ,  but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you &apos;re being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem .
 more often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person ,  someone who will care or listen to them ,  of course i am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - i know it shouldn &apos;t be anyone elses responsibility ,  all i am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better ,  linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it ,  it &apos;s much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side .
 again ,  i don &apos;t want to come off as a dick here - i think it &apos;s great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help ,  but try to keep this in mind .
 that feeling of being pushed away or getting a predictable and generic answer often makes you feel more isolated and more depressed .
 by the way ,  i wish there was a suicide chatline and not a hotline .
 i don &apos;t like speaking out loud to a person about any issues i might be having .
 i attempted suicide at 19 .
 i think the hardest thing for non-suicidal people to understand is that a lot of suicidal people don &apos;t want to kill themselves ,  they just want to stop existing .
 actually going through the steps of writing a note and taking the pills was extremely difficult and all i kept thinking the whole time was that it would be so much easier if i could just fall asleep and never wake up .
 it was scary to think that i was potentially killing myself whereas a death i couldn &apos;t control or had less control over would just .
 then there &apos;s everyone and everything else to consider .
 i also have caught myself wishing many times that the whole world would end so that i could stop existing but then neither myself nor my loved ones would have to deal with the pain or miss out on a good life .
 i found those things really hard to articulate at 19 .
 it &apos;s how a lot of depressed people feel .
 a person from my past reaching out to me ,  even for 5 minutes ,  does exceptionally more for my mental wellbeing than seeing 10 , 000 redditors spam the numbers for different suicide prevention hotlines .
 please ,  please reach out to the people in your life .
 you can keep it as light as you want .
 we &apos;re social creatures ,  and even limited interaction goes a very long way .
 i did not write this but have permission to share .
 just saw this elsewhere on the internet in reference to recent events .
 for obvious reasons (at least ,  for anyone who has had to listen to me bitch about how much i hate winter) ,  it really resonated with me .
 when you have depression it’s like it snows every day .
 some days it’s only a couple of inches .
 it’s a pain in the ass ,  but you still make it to work ,  the grocery store .
 sure ,  maybe you skip the gym or your friend’s birthday party ,  but it is still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight .
 probably better to just head home .
  your friend notices ,  but probably just thinks you are flaky now ,  or kind of an asshole .
 some days it snows a foot .
 you spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work .
 your back and hands hurt from shoveling .
 you leave early because it’s really coming down out there .
 your boss notices .
 some days it snows four feet .
 you shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed .
 you are not making it to work ,  or anywhere else for that matter .
 you are so sore and tired you just get back in bed .
 by the time you wake up ,  all your shoveling has filled back in with snow .
 looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are .
 you don’t feel like calling them back ,  too tired from all the shoveling .
 plus they don’t get this much snow at their house so they don’t understand why you’re still stuck at home .
 they just think you’re lazy or weak ,  although they rarely come out and say it .
 some weeks it’s a full-blown blizzard .
 when you open your door ,  it’s to a wall of snow .
 the power flickers ,  then goes out .
 it’s too cold to sit in the living room anymore ,  so you get back into bed with all your clothes on .
 the stove and microwave won’t work so you eat a cold pop tart and call that dinner .
 you haven’t taken a shower in three days ,  but how could you at this point ?
 you’re too cold to do anything except sleep .
 sometimes people get snowed in for the winter .
 the cold seeps in .
 no communication in or out .
 the food runs out .
 what can you even do ,  tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands ?
 how far away is help ?
 can you even get there in a blizzard ?
 if you do ,  can they even help you at this point ?
 maybe it’s death to stay here ,  but it’s death to go out there too .
 the thing is ,  when it snows all the time ,  you get worn all the way down .
 you get tired of being cold .
 you get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling ,  but if you don’t shovel on the light days ,  it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days .
 you resent the hell out of the snow ,  but it doesn’t care ,  it’s just a blind chemistry ,  an act of nature .
 it carries on regardless ,  unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world .
 also ,  the snow builds up in other areas ,  places you can’t shovel ,  sometimes places you can’t even see .
 maybe it’s on the roof .
 maybe it’s on the mountain behind the house .
 sometimes ,  there’s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it .
 a veritable act of god ,  nothing can be done .
 the neighbors say it’s a shame and they can’t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling .
 i don’t know how it went down for anthony bourdain or kate spade .
 it seems like they got hit by the avalanche ,  but it could’ve been the long ,  slow winter .
 maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling .
 maybe they weren’t .
 sometimes ,  shoveling isn’t enough anyway .
 it’s hard to tell from the outside ,  but it’s important to understand what it’s like from the inside .
 i firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action .
 it’s important to understand what depression is ,  how it feels ,  what it’s like to live with it ,  so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis .
 i’m not putting heavy shit out here to make your friday morning suck .
 i know it feels gross to read it ,  and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it ,  that’s why people pull away .
 i don’t have a message for people with depression like “keep shoveling .
  of course you’re going to keep shoveling the best you can ,  until you physically can’t ,  because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house ?
 we know what the stakes are .
 my message is to everyone else .
 grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor .
 slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood .
 petition the city council to buy more salt trucks ,  so to speak .
 depression is blind chemistry and physics ,  like snow .
 and like the weather ,  it is a mindless process ,  powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm .
 but like climate change ,  that doesn’t mean we are helpless .
 if we want to stop losing so many people to this disease ,  it will require action at every level .
 feel free to share this with anyone or anywhere you think it might help .
 we aren &apos;t alone .
 even when there &apos;s warm bodies around when we are cold we still shiver .
 offer a blanket .
 edit 2: i just want to say thank you and you &apos;re welcome to everyone who is commenting and can relate .
 you &apos;re not alone .
 not just me ,  but many of us truly understand how you feel .
 but i won &apos;t tell you what to do .
 we who suffer have been told time and again what to do .
 but if someone offers you a blanket sometimes the warmth can help .
 edit 3: i &apos;m trying to comment on everyone that is posting and thanking me for sharing .
 i think it &apos;s important that everyone is acknowledged that took the time to share their thoughts .
 thank you to whomever (whoever ?
 ) gave me my first gold .
 and all the gold after !
 it was absolutely not necessary but very much appreciated .
 i have a very busy life ,  so people ask me if i regret having her ,  since dogs are all high maintenance .
 i need to walk her a few times a day ,  feed her ,  keep her entertained ,  clean up after her ,  remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers .
 i don &apos;t regret it .
 i got her for one purpose that i won &apos;t tell them .
 because i &apos;m lonely .
 because when i &apos;m at my loneliest ,  i don &apos;t have anyone to turn to ,  no-one to go see ,  to talk to ,  despite my best efforts .
 i have her because i know if i died ,  something would miss me ,  so i can &apos;t leave her .
 i left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip ,  earlier this week .
 i found myself calling for her ,  and she wouldn &apos;t come .
 for the first time in years ,  i just cried .
 i wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves .
 fortunately ,  i could just grab her the next day .
 but it reminded me how important she is to my mental health .
 i recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where i would have even less familial and friend support .
 i would have been traveling most of the year ,  so i would have to give up my dog .
 i &apos;m glad i did .
 i had one friend tell me to  &apos;absolutely not take the job &apos;; he said if i took it ,  he gave me 6 months before i jumped off a bridge .
 i can &apos;t say he would be wrong .
 i used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years ,  which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that i was close to .
 and then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he &apos;s trying to fire me .
 i have the ceo and president behind me ,  so he can &apos;t touch me; they know what i did for the company ,  my sacrifice ,  my skill ,  my dedication and loyalty .
 i now have much less responsibilities ,  so i can relax .
 now ,  i &apos;m here ,  with my dog ,  trying to decompress from my job ,  make more friends ,  actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying .
 things are starting to look better .
 here &apos;s to better days .
 i work at poison control .
 one of our main jobs is to provide advice to hospitals caring for patients who have overdosed .
 i will never forget one teenaged girl who took an overdose of tylenol ,  and apparently regreted it shortly afterwards but was afraid of telling anyone .
 she didnt tell anyone until 3 days later .
 she walked into the er awake and talking and died waiting for a liver transplant .
 she left behind a heart broken family and more friends than she realized she had .
 if you come to the hospital within a few hours of taking pills ,  it can be fixed .
 don &apos;t be afraid to get the help you need .
 i’m the mother of a toddler who died of cancer .
 there is nothing anyone could do to prevent me from killing myself- besides listening and being present .
 i didn’t reach out to anyone .
 being suicidal means you want to die- no one could have talked me out of it .
 my family knew i was struggling and they took shifts watching me .
 they bought me my favorite foods ,  watched ru paul’s drag race with me for weeks (seriously .
 for some reason it was the only thing i could watch .
 ) they listened to me cry and didn’t try to give me solutions .
 they just said “i know” .
 we had a code word- potato .
 if i said potato ,  that meant that i needed someone to be physically present with me .
 there was always a plan for the next day- “tomorrow we’re going to have lunch at that mexican place ,  ok ?
 ” “tomorrow let’s look for a special garden marker for miles .
 ” i think that was a big part of it- having a plan for the next day meant i had to keep going .
 it’s been almost four months since my 3 year old died and i’m still living .
 that’s pretty fucking amazing .
 my brother committed suicide when i was 8 .
 my dad has been abusive but my brother suffered the most from him .
 he was my hero .
 i looked up to him and wanted to be like him .
 he’d take the fall for me when i did something that would cause my dad to punish me .
 i remember that morning vividly .
 i got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked .
 i kept coming back but he wouldn’t answer the door .
 my parents weren’t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that .
 when it was time for bed i told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again .
 after my brother didn’t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling .
 i wish i didn’t see that .
 i screamed the entire time and wouldn’t left go of his hand .
 it felt cold and my mother had to peel me away .
 he left a suicide note and a hand written will .
 he left me his favourite book .
 i miss you jeff .
 thank you so much everyone for the love .
 edit 2: my dad kept repeating “why jeffery ?
 and tried to get him down from the fan .
 i was screaming please jeff !
 and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn’t separate our hands she pulled me away .
 she was crying so hard .
 i remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming “you should have opened his door for me” .
 edit 3: the book is animal farm by george orwell .
 i always carry it with me now .
 whenever he’d read it to me i’d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we’d laugh .
 there wasn’t much in his will .
 he left me the book and his game boy .
 he left my mom his wrist watch .
 my dad didn’t get anything in the will .
 edit 4: wow i woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love .
 thank you for all your kind words .
 i’ve never spoken about the details before and i pray this helps someone who is struggling .
 to all the jeff’s ,  i know it’s hard but please be strong .
 you don’t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering .
 it’s the most painful thing ever .
 for years i had nightmares of trying to save him but each time i’d get there too late .
 in his note he said he was really sorry and didn’t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn’t bear the pain anymore .
 he said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world .
 he told my mom he loved her and hoped she’d find the courage he didn’t have .
 thanks to all the gold x 4 !
 i wish this was up last week .
 a very close friend of mine committed suicide in the 2nd .
 she was only 19 and could light up a room when she came in .
 the worst thing is feeling like i could have stopped her .
 after work the day before she asked me if i wanted to go out .
 i didn &apos;t because i was tired and had to clean .
 her memorial was yesterday .
 its still such a raw wound .
 i &apos;m sorry i had to get this off my chest .
 thank you all who &apos;ve messaged me or replied with support and their own experiences .
 i know logically it wasn &apos;t my fault but emotionally it hurts .
 i &apos;m slowly starting to accept what happened but it will be a while before i &apos;ll be back to normal .
 also to the asshat that messaged me and told me it was my fault ,  go fuck yourself .
 almost exactly a year ago one of my best mates called drunk in the middle of the night telling me that he was going to end it ,  and he wanted to apologize for doing this and thank me for being the only one to support him .
 i got so fucking scared and started calling people that had been on the same party that he attended earlier and managed to find him nearby walking alone towards the rail tracks .
 i ran towards him and stopped him ,  we talked for almost 5 hours straight that night .
 we agreed for him to try therapy .
 atleast for him ,  and now he is on his way back up pursuing a career in graphic design .
 i urge everyone who feel depressed atleast try to talk to someone ,  your family ,  friends or a therapist/hotline as it might help more than you think .
 my mom killed herself on april 22nd of this year .
 my dad found her naked ,  fallen off the side of the bed ,  with three empty pill bottles ,  two knives ,  and a razor .
 she was covered in vomit .
 the ambulance came ,  but she was unresponsive .
 they waited until i arrived to ask if they could stop resuscitation attempts ,  which they tried to do for over an hour .
 we went in when they stopped .
 she was half covered with a sheet ,  there was a lot of blood and vomit .
 her ribs were broken from resuscitation attempts .
 my dad and i are totally lost .
 last december i checked into a psych ward instead of killing myself .
 currently suicidal person here ,  lived a kind of shit life .
 abusive parents ,  bobbed through foster care .
 mother is a schizophrenic with psychosis .
 recently diagnosed with ptsd and severe depression .
 with a moderate risk of schizophrenia .
 so the question is ,  is suicide a better option than taking the gamble of mental illness ?
 because my mother was a living nightmare .
 i think the biggest problem for me is imposter syndrome .
 i have a relatively good life and it doesn &apos;t feel like i &apos;ve earned the right to be depressed .
 as a result i don &apos;t acknowledge it or deal with it professionally .
 i called my doctor today .
  time to get this shit sorted out .
 e: should add that this isn’t as huge and sudden as it sounds .
  been living with this for more than ten years ,  and i’ve been back on medication for a few months now after a full year off them .
 but things like bourdain’s suicide - and scott hutchison’s in particular ,  which really punched me in the gut - are a reminder that i need to take this more seriously instead of just munching the pills and hoping it’ll go away again .
 thank you for the supportive messages though .
  you’d be surprised how much of a difference they sometimes make .
 when i was a teenager i had bad problems with depression and anxiety that led to very self-destructive behavior .
 there were many times i imagined killing myself and one night i was set on doing it .
 came home drunk and sad and started cutting myself ,  which was one of my methods for dealing with my emotions .
 i sat in my bed crying ,  trying to find the courage to cut deeper and end it .
 then my dog snoopy hopped up on the bed and put his head on my lap .
 thanks to him i realized that i just couldn &apos;t do that to him or to my parents and friends .
 he saved my life that night .
 the next day i decided to open up to my parents and ask them to help me find some help ,  which was a huge step forward .
 sometimes all it takes is a reminder that someone loves you to help you start trying to love yourself .
 this will get buried but until just recently my major depressive disorder was in remission .
 something happened about 2 months ago that turned my life upside down and as a result ,  i’ve recently been struggling with suicidal thoughts .
 they’ve been escalating ,  inch by inch .
 i read through maybe 30 responses on this thread and am nearly in tears at my desk .
 i needed to be reminded that i am not alone and that the metaphorical demon that is depression haunts so many people on this earth .
 i cannot give up or give in .
 i needed this today to motivate me to stay the course .
 i beat this once ,  i can do it again .
 one of my favorite quotes is by winston churchill: .
 when you’re going through hell ,  keep going .
 thank you to everyone contributing to this thread .
 my mum took her life when i was 12 ,  a year after my parents had separated .
 afterwards i lived with my dad and my little sister ,  and took a big role in raising her while battling my own depression and self harm .
 10 years later ,  just when i was starting to get in good place emotionally ,  my sister jumped off a bridge .
 she was 18 years old .
 it &apos;s been a few years since she took her life ,  and what i &apos;ve learned is that no matter how much better you think your family would be without you ,  that &apos;s just not true .
 i miss my mum ,  and i miss having a mum .
 my sister was my best friend ,  and even after all the tough things she put me through over the years (drug addiction ,  stealing ,  etc .
 ) ,  it was so worth it to have her around .
 i think about her every day and would do anything to have her back .
 i don &apos;t talk about suicide much ,  because it is a very painful subject for me .
 perhaps ,  in part ,  because the shadow of it stalks me sometimes ,  waiting to catch me when i &apos;m down .
 but 11 years ago ,  i was desperate enough to believe that everyone who knew me would be better off without me .
 i believed that the scales weighed heavily against me - that i caused more harm than good - and that if i simply didn &apos;t exist ,  it would make things better for everyone .
 so i started counting my pills .
 i &apos;d been seeking treatment for depression for five months ,  but nothing was working .
 the meds made me worse ,  or they made me so apathetic that i found no joy in life ,  or they gave me such bad side effects that i could barely stay lucid .
 i thought there was no way out .
 so i was counting my pills ,  trying to figure out how many would cause an overdose so i could take them ,  lie down in bed ,  and die .
 i &apos;d arranged them all nicely ,  counted out every single one .
 i &apos;d positioned my glass of water next to them all ,  and i stood staring at the scene ,  feeling so overwhelmed because the intensity and duration of my suffering had been so drawn out ,  and it just wasn &apos;t getting better .
 it had been years .
 a slow decline until a breakdown ,  and then i was in so deep i couldn &apos;t see a way out .
 then the phone rang .
 it was a friend of mine ,  a catholic priest ,  who said he felt moved to call me and see how i was doing in case things were bad .
 i lied to him; i told him that i was fine ,  that i was receiving treatment and that i was hopeful that things would start looking up .
 but i didn &apos;t think i had any fight left in me .
 he told me that he believed i did ,  and that he hoped i could hang on awhile longer .
 i hung up the phone and burst into tears - ugly ,  inconsolable crying ,  snot dripping out my nose ,  curled up in a ball .
 but my friend had planted a seed of hope .
 someone believed in me ,  even if i couldn &apos;t .
 and i guess i felt that i owed it to him - and to my family - to try .
 i managed to get an appointment at the emergency psychiatry clinic awhile later ,  and there i met the psychiatrist who prescribed the drug that saved my life .
 i got into a daily outpatient program at the hospital .
 i met other people who were like me ,  and i found myself believing in them - believing that they could fight ,  that they could get better ,  even though i didn &apos;t believe i could .
 somehow ,  they said they believed in me ,  too .
 and so for a second time ,  i saw that other people believed in me ,  even if i didn &apos;t .
 and i felt again that i should try .
 i got into weekly therapy with a psychiatrist ,  and i was in her care for seven years .
 she adjusted my meds as needed and we began the long ,  arduous process of untangling the mess that was my mind .
 she never gave up on me .
 (i &apos;m in a country where she doesn &apos;t make money off me .
 she gets a flat salary .
 now ,  it &apos;s 11 years later ,  and things have gotten better .
 i am better now than i ever have been .
 it took awhile after my rock bottom moment to find that spark of hope within myself ,  but i did find it ,  and that is what kept me going .
 it made me look for anything i could to keep me hanging on ,  and even now ,  it &apos;s the small things in life that keep me here .
 when the moon shines through my window at night and pools on my pillow .
 when the white blossoms on that weird bush in the backyard finally bloom for one week every year ,  and i can smell them on the wind .
 when my dog wakes up in the morning and comes to get me because he is happy i am awake .
 when the sun shines just right ,  or the wind sends petals filtering down through the trees ,  or the world is silent and glittery after a fresh snowfall .
 i find those moments ,  and i  &apos;keep &apos; them .
 i commit them to memory so that when things get bad again ,  i can remember what i love about this life ,  and remind myself to keep hanging on .
 i still get low .
 two years ago ,  i had been fired from my job and was certain i would never become a fully functional adult and i would always have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in society .
 i stood on a subway platform and listened to the rattle of the trains and tried to convince myself not to jump .
 the tracks were hypnotising ,  almost .
 i looked up and found myself staring at a poster for suicide prevention ,  and the irony was not lost on me .
 it broke the trance .
 i stepped back from the yellow line and went home .
 last month ,  i got slapped in the face with a bout of severe depression out of nowhere ,  and then my dog passed away ,  which made it worse .
 (dogs immensely improve my mental health .
 you can stay ,  too .
 take it day by day .
 for those of us with severe mental health issues ,  that &apos;s all we can do - take it day by day ,  see how we feel ,  see if there are any little joys we can find and savour them .
 you have to cultivate the ability to find them ,  and it might not be easy at first .
 (i &apos;m a stubborn ass and was originally so intent on believing that there was nothing good in the world that it took me a couple years to learn how to look closer .
 ) but eventually ,  you &apos;ll have a breakthrough .
 maybe you &apos;ll see a toddler get pegged by a ball and you &apos;ll fall over laughing .
 maybe you &apos;ll hear the cicadas buzz in the heat of august and remember how awesome summers felt as a kid .
 maybe you &apos;ll find an indie game on steam that has a really compelling story and you &apos;ll find that you can &apos;t wait to get back to it and find out what happens next .
 you never know .
 but you can stay .
 just take it day by day .
 and you can see what happens .
 my father hung himself four years ago ,  and it caught all of our family by total surprise .
 but in retrospect ,  the signs were there .
 i still wish i had seen them more clearly .
 if i could share a few things i’ve learned upon reflection ,  and losing my pops: .
 don’t be harsh with your loved ones when they’re struggling .
 don’t negate sadness or depression ,  their struggle is real ,  despite your inability to experience it .
 be open ,  be vulnerable  .
 my dad never said “i’m hurting” but he did exhibit signs .
 don’t try to fix .
 this is a struggle that can’t be fixed by logic ,  by words ,  by an external force .
 this person needs to want to change ,  internally - and there’s no “magic solution” like a job ,  money ,  or relationship that can do it .
 all you can do it listen ,  empathize ,  and love .
 don’t hide from the unpleasantness that is depression ,  face it with your loved one who struggles .
 let them know their pain is your pain ,  and you are in this together .
 damn ,  this thread is heavy .
 so much pain from so many different people .
 for what it &apos;s worth ,  this internet stranger is rooting for you .
 bourdain &apos;s death really bothers me for a specific reason .
 i think ,   like many people my age ,  i struggle with trying to find a vocation that  gives me happiness .
 we &apos;re millennials ,  and we were raised with the idea  that we could do whatever we wanted .
 so when reality hit like a truck ,   and we found ourselves working the same boring job that 99&#37; of us were  going to get ,  we found ourselves perpetually unsatisfied with our lives .
  that &apos;s why so many of us struggle with depression .
 what  i hear often is that the true way to happiness is to explore the world ,   to see culture ,  to meet people ,  and to grow that way as a person .
 that was literally anthony bourdain &apos;s job .
 he got paid millions to  travel the world ,  to see culture ,  to meet people ,  and to grow .
 and he  killed himself .
 so what hope does that give to the rest of us ?
 no one knows the burden others carry ,  don &apos;t trivialize other &apos;s pain .
 it may seem small to you but it is crushing to them .
 we all have crosses to bear and they are all made of wood .
 i was 12 years old when i found my uncle ,  who had hanged himself with a belt in my grandma’s basement .
 from that day on ,  i experienced depression and ptsd and i still do .
 there’s not a day that goes by where i don’t think about it .
 nobody from my family reaches out to me ,  none of my friends do ,  i’ve been alone for the last few years and what i would do for anyone to tell me they care about me and love me .
 but hey i’m still here .
 i’m still going .
 i’m now 2 for 2 in suicide attempts being stopped by my cat .
 just her staring and meowing .
 always have something or someone nearby; that might just save you .
 i had some dark episodes in my life where i was severely depressed .
 went in and out of psychiatric hospitals ,  medication didn’t work and i felt so bad that i agreed with electro shocks .
 it didn’t work ,  i felt like i was out of options .
 i tried to kill myself ,  took an overdose and was found 2 days later ,  almost dead .
 i passed out in my chair and had severe pressure ulcers on my lower back and butt cheeks .
 i was in a coma for 2 weeks .
 my kidneys shut down ,  dialysis was required .
 i sustained nerve damage due to cut off blood circulation and i had to learn to walk again .
 couldn’t pee normally .
 multiple operations were required to fix the pressure ulcer mess .
 i hated that i was found before i died .
 time passed by and things gradually became better .
 aside from nerve pains and a partially paralysed foot i fully recovered .
 i found a good job ,  people that supported me and an environment in which i could recover .
 bit by bit i crawled out of the dark hole .
 i came across someone who loved me ,  she became my wife and we have been happily married for 3 years .
 i became a dad and there are times when i’m the happiest guy in the world .
 i’m so extremely grateful that i made it out of the darkness alive .
 sometimes i still feel the dark ,  but i learned that it always will get better eventually .
 my best friend ,  who i met in a psychiatric hospital ,  didn’t find his way to the light .
 he sunk deeper ,  couldn’t take it anymore and committed suicide .
 unfortunately he succeeded .
 the world turns on but he will be 26 forever .
 it’s extremely confronting to feel how much it hurts when someone you love ,  sinks too deep and leaves this world .
 for friends and family it’s a scar that never heals .
 if only he had found his place in the world ,  it would have been different .
 whoever you are that reads this ,  and is sinking so deep that death seems inevitable: try to fight like you never fought before ,  and don’t give up .
 do it for the people that love you ,  but more important ,  try to do it for your future self .
 somewhere there is a place for you to heal ,  i wholeheartedly hope you will find it .
 stay strong and keep going for the light .
 i &apos;ve been dealing with depression for years now but i did try to commit suicide in high school .
 i hit rock bottom when a family member falsely accused me of raping them .
 the police ,  my family ,  everyone in my life seemed to take their side .
 the judge ruled that i couldn &apos;t stay at my house during the investigation because my little sisters where there and they seemed me a danger to them .
 i ended up being put up in a shitty hotel for a month while my attorney fought to have any kind of medical exam done to try to prove my innocence .
 being shunned by everyone i &apos;ve cared for got to be too much and i decided i &apos;d had enough .
 i managed to get ahold of a bunch of pain pills and a fifth of jack and took them all and went to bed .
 i woke up the next morning in a pool of vomit .
 in the end though ,  i &apos;m glad i survived my attempt ,  things got better .
 my accuser couldn &apos;t keep their story straight and ended up confessing to making it up in court .
 my life has started to stabilize and i met the woman of my dreams who has helped me work through my issues .
 i still deal with depression but i &apos;ve got a pretty good treatment regimen right now .
 sorry if this seems rambling ,  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever mentioned this in any kind of public setting .
 i &apos;ve had two attempts in the last two years .
 my life right now is actually going pretty well .
 it just sucks that all these people keep killing themselves .
 it makes me worried about my future .
 am i going to hold on until i &apos;m 35 then put a bullet through my head ?
 am i going to drown myself at 42 ?
 i &apos;ve been struggling with wanting to die for 15 years .
 i &apos;m medicated ,  i completed a program recently .
 maybe its not worth it .
 i have a good partner right now and a good support system though .
 i was honest with my girlfriend this morning about how this has all made me feel .
 we &apos;re getting pizza and driving into the mountains or maybe the forest tonight to reconnect with nature .
 i tend to find peace after that .
 the thing that got me recently was talking to my roommate/best friend about my mental health the last couple years .
 she &apos;s usually stoic .
 we work for the same company and she &apos;s known as the scrooge (with a secret soft heart) .
 she looked at me and said ,   &apos;the thing is .
 if you had been successful .
 i know that ten years from now ,  i &apos;d be sitting in like a dennys or something sitting across from other friend and i &apos;d be smiling .
 but then ,  i &apos;d still look at an empty chair and wonder if you &apos;d be there with me &apos; and she cried so deeply ,  i &apos;m tearing up now just thinking about it .
 i tried to kill myself at the end of may of this year .
 i felt like i hit rock bottom ,  and at the time it seemed like the only way out .
 i lost the woman i loved ,  i started drinking everyday ,  i hurt a lot of people emotionally .
 i thought that if i pushed everyone away ,  it would be easier to let go .
 i’m not comfortable saying how i did it ,  but when i regained consciousness i called a friend who helped me .
 i’m so glad that i wasn’t successful .
 when i was a young child ,  my mom and i walked in on my brother unconscious after a hanging and it’s an image that is seared into my brain .
 thankfully he survived ,  but i’ll never forget my mom’s screams of agony ,  and her pleading with god when she was trying to get him to wake up .
 the thought of her having to go through that again ,  ensures that i will never attempt it anymore .
 instead of wishing to die in my sleep ,  i’m so thankful for every day that i wake up .
 because every day ,  is a fresh start .
 and to the kind stranger on here who has talked to me and helped me ,  if you ever read this ,  thank you so much .
 you have helped more than you’ll ever know .
 please be mindful that most suicidal people are well aware of the existence of suicide hotlines ,  that many of them are also well-versed in the kinds of pith advice people want to dish out so liberally (well intentioned as it is) and that many of them do not want to die .
 they just do not know what else to do .
 some are truly devastatingly depressed or mentally ill .
 but this is not uniformly true .
 many many people who are suicidal are genuinely not  &apos;mentally ill .
 speaking of myself a long time ago now and others i have known - there are people out there whose suicidal ideation is a  &apos;logical &apos; analytic response to essentially impossible life pressures and situations and - right or wrong - it can feel very hurtful ,  even offensive ,  and unhelpful to tell them their thinking is clouded .
 i and others i have known used the same basically functional working (but very very stressed) analytic mind to choose not to commit suicide .
 as i moved through that place and eventually out of it ,  i had to hold onto the  &apos;option &apos; in my mind and make the choice -- albeit increasingly more easily -- many times before it was gone .
 all that and this too - please don &apos;t turn people into messages or psas .
 suicide is absolutely horrible - i have been affected by its aftermath more times than i care to share ,  very directly and less intimately as well .
 it is probably almost never the right thing to do (save terminal illness ,  etc) but its important to honor lives as more than their ending .
 i never bothered planning for the rest of my life because i didn &apos;t expect to make it through high school .
 i graduated last week and i &apos;m off to college in a few months .
 still can &apos;t really imagine staying alive ,   but i &apos;m not actively trying to end it .
 so i guess that &apos;s good .
 my brother committed suicide at the age of 15 - i was 16 at the time .
 one piece of advice that i can give to those who have been effected by suicide is to talk to someone ,  i mean talk to someone; whether it be a friend ,  parent or hell even your dog ,  just talk .
 i &apos;m almost 26 now and for years and directly after ,  i buried all of my emotions and refused to talk to anyone ,  even my family ,  about it .
  it has really messed me up both emotionally and with my relationship with people and the world in the long run - and only in the last year have i realized this .
 so ,  please ,  just talk to someone ,  don &apos;t be like me .
 on friday i got tired of being tired .
 it was weird ,  as soon as i reviewed my plans and checked it would work i felt calm and relieved .
 i started working on my letters to family .
 my husband had some friends over already ,  everyone was drinking and hanging out .
 i left the notebook unattended and my 17 year old stepson saw it ,  and asked to talk - for the first time in my 8 years of being his stepmom .
 him ,  his girlfriend ,  and my other stepson had me sit and talk for hours .
 they told me all the things in my head weren &apos;t real .
 for 8 years all i had was good and bad memories and no way to tell which ones they remember .
 for a lot of reasons i thought they barely tolerated me .
 i never thought they would care if i left .
 if you love someone ,  tell them you do .
 tell them often .
 it could save a life .
 i was suicidal about 6 months ago after my girlfriend/lifelong best friend left me .
 i decided i finally needed help .
 i knew i had deep issues but didn’t want to deal with them .
 i always masked them and found ways to distract myself .
 i went to my family doctor and got referred to a psychiatrist and i’ve been seeing a few for the last couple months .
 i feel very proud to say that this week has been my first week in years that i can say i’ve been genuinely happy and proud of myself .
 it genuinely does .
 even when you’re in the deepest hole .
 but you can’t do it alone .
 you can’t just cover over your issues .
 you need to destroy them .
 in canada ,  you can get referred to therapists for free by your family doctor .
 it takes a long time ,  but the wait is worth it .
 in the meantime ,  tell your friends .
 if they’re your true friends ,  they’ll understand .
 and ,  if you’re like me ,  you’ll find out that they’re going through the same thing .
 wow ,  didn’t expect such a huge response .
 i didn’t even expect anybody to see this .
 thank you everybody for the kind words !
 unfortunately ,  not everything works for everybody .
 i also have no idea how things work in the us .
 if somebody has gotten help in the states ,  please respond to a few comments below !
 edit 2: thanks for the gold !
 also ,  it appears that some places in canada you do not get free therapists .
 hopefully it’ll be easier for everybody one day 
 in 2015 i was fresh off a wonderful honeymoon with my amazing wife when i hit a little low .
 i &apos;m manic depressive and am used to the ups and downs ,  but this low didn &apos;t go away .
 i thought i was stronger than my depression but it just kept going .
 after about 6 months my spouse was just barely able to hang in there and was spending a lot of time at her mother &apos;s in another town because i was just such a fucking asshole and was losing myself .
 christmas night that year ,  wife was at her family &apos;s celebration ,  i sat in our guest bedroom alone and had my 9mm in my hand .
 i struggled and was crying and angry and a fucking nightmare was unfolding in my head .
 i couldn &apos;t do it though .
 i let my dog in and be jumped on me and was licking me and wagging his tail ,  so i hung out with him for a while and put the gun away .
 i promised my wife i would try to make the changes necessary to recover and fast forward to today ,  we &apos;re halfway through her pregnancy with our first !
 i &apos;m very physically active and i have things to work towards ,  and now a son coming that deserves a great set of parents .
 my wife is incredible and she stuck with me through times where i would have left myself .
 she did what she could when she could ,  considering how much i was pushing everyone away during that time .
 i can never repay her for being loyal to me when i don &apos;t think i deserved loyalty ,  i just hope i can give her and my son the best husband and dad possible for the rest of our lives .
 at the time ,  i was planning to make everyone hate me so no one would miss me when i finally killed myself .
 it was a dark pattern that made me lose who i was .
 i am a different person today and i have learned to recognize the signs and not ignore my  &apos;small lows &apos; .
 i never miss a chance to tell my wife how wonderful she is .
 i also added the physically active part because getting back into shape and being physically tired is incredibly therapeutic for me ,  personally .
 lately my depressions been really bad .
 it seems like no matter how much i try to reach out no one gives a fuck about your mental health until you’re already dead .
 a guy is walking down the street and falls down a hole ,  the walls are so steep he can &apos;t climb out .
 a doctor passes by and the guy says l ,   &apos;hey can you help me out ?
  &apos; the doctor writes him a prescription ,  throws it in the hole ,  and moves on .
 then a priest walks by again the man shouts ,   &apos;father can you help me out ?
  &apos; the priest writes a prayer ,  throws it in the hole ,  and moves on .
 a friend walks by later the man shouts ,   &apos;hey joe it &apos;s me can you help me out &apos; so the friend jumps down into the hole and our guy says ,   &apos;what are you stupid now we &apos;re both down here &apos; and the friend says ,   &apos;yea but i &apos;ve been down here before and i know the way out &apos;  .
 you are never alone .
 my best friend killed himself about 11 years ago at the age of 25 .
 i will never forget when he called me the last time .
 we talked casually .
 at the end of the conversation he dropped a question on how i dealt with my anxiety attacks as he was experiencing a similar situation .
 at this point in his life he was just about to finish his  degree in industrial design .
 he had a girlfriend from spain and life in general looked promising .
 however i guess he felt anxiety about his girlfriend leaving back for her home country ,  him ending one life segment and entering a new one .
 he jumped of his balcony located on the 8th floor .
 i remember getting the call where i was told that he was gone .
 i had to lean over as i felt all my air was sucked out of my lungs .
 i remember cleaning out his apartments with other friends to help his parents ,  driving his car back to his parents from the college town he lived in .
 i remember us meeting in 1989 in 1st grade ,  were we became friends .
 i remember being at his funeral .
 tom was his name .
 and i remember you forever !
 hi ,  i tried to commit suicide last week .
 everything was going down the drain .
 i wasn &apos;t participating in school ,  i was distancing myself from my friends ,  my mom had been confined in the hospital around 8 times this year alone ,  and my boyfriend of 8 years said that he didn &apos;t love me the same anymore .
 wednesday last week was supposed to be my last day .
 i started taking hella pills in the morning ,  but i still went to school .
 i distanced myself from my group of friends ,  saying that i had a migraine .
 i had already said my goodbyes to them in my mind .
 i went to see my mom in the hospital afterwards .
 i was mentally apologizing to her about what i was about to do .
 then she sat me down and talked to me about how she was feeling .
 she told me that she was thankful that i was always there for her; small things like how i stayed with her the whole day during mother’s day ,  even though she knew that i was bored out of my mind .
 she told me that she was so thankful that i was around to help take care of my siblings .
 she told me that i was one of the pillars of her strength ,  and that she would always love me ,  no matter what .
 she told me that she didn’t know what she would do without me ,  and that my faith in her is what gives her strength everyday .
 when i came home that night ,  i had prepared all the things that i needed; all the notes were there ,  and of course ,  all the pills .
 however ,  i couldn’t bring myself to start .
 whenever i tried to start ,  i thought about my mom and how she said that my support for her lessened half her battle .
 i thought about my sisters .
 what if my mom gives up fighting when i’m gone ?
 my sisters will be left without a mother ,  and a sister .
 i would be known as “the sister who committed suicide before she even turned 21” .
 who would be there to guide them ,  and to teach them ?
 i might be living for someone else right now ,  but i want to live .
 for the sake of my mom and my sisters ,  i’ll fight just for a little while longer .
 i got a dog here .
 if i didn &apos;t come home one day ,  he &apos;d never stop sitting by the door waiting for me .
 he &apos;d never stop missing my smell and my voice .
 he &apos;d never stop wishing for one more walk ,  one more game of chasing the laser with me ,  one more high-five for a treat .
 he &apos;d never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk ,  and letting his heart be filled with a moment &apos;s joyful hope .
 no matter how many times that hope was dashed ,  he &apos;d never let go of it .
 he &apos;s kind of a doofus that way .
 anybody else in my life might eventually get over it .
 you can explain to them what happened and they &apos;d at least be able to understand if not accept it .
 but my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why i didn &apos;t come home .
 and he &apos;s had a hard enough life so far .
 i was his only friend when he had nobody ,  and he was mine .
 no matter what i &apos;m going through in life ,  putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do .
 otherwise ,  i probably would have done it already .
 there &apos;s no fate .
 there &apos;s no karma .
  &apos;the secret &apos; doesn &apos;t actually work ,  except for making the people who wrote those books rich .
 there &apos;s no magic santa claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished .
 maybe god exists ,  but he sure doesn &apos;t interfere .
 i &apos;ve been praying for decades for some sort of help ,  or at least guidance so i can help myself .
 no answers either .
 for example ,  why did a loving god let such an abusive monster come into my mom &apos;s life when i was a kid ,  turning me into an emotional cripple who can &apos;t deal with any sort of stress without crumbling ?
 why does child abuse happen every single day in this world ?
 so a sane person can only conclude that it &apos;s all just random .
 that can be scary .
 but it can also be liberating .
 it means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point .
 it can &apos;t all be bad forever .
 that breaks the laws of the universe .
 at some point something randomly good will happen .
 the scales will eventually balance .
 there &apos;s no intelligence behind it .
 it &apos;s just chaos that &apos;s part good and part bad .
 fighting it won &apos;t change anything .
 one thing &apos;s for sure ,  though .
 those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them .
 sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism .
 prepare for emergencies so that they don &apos;t destroy you ,  and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come .
 but overall ,  just wait and watch ,  knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever ,  but neither can anything be bad forever .
 people try to reach out and say  &apos;i &apos;ll help you ,  i &apos;ll talk to you ,  if you need me &apos; ,  but it &apos;s not enough .
 if you had a massive issue that you couldn &apos;t even pinpoint what it was ,  how would you go about telling someone about it ,  and asking for help ?
 or even when you do tell them you are having issues ,  and they shrug it off because they aren &apos;t in your place and they can &apos;t understand .
 what do you do ?
 nothing ,  you &apos;re alone .
 i was depressed for a little over a year ,  and that year felt like an eternity .
 i felt like a prisoner in my own mind .
 depression feels like .
 being stuck in a dark ,  cramped ,  windowless room .
 you can &apos;t see anything ,  you can &apos;t move ,  you &apos;re suffocating .
 there are people on the outside telling you that they will figure out a way to get you out .
 that they are with you .
 but in truth they have no idea what to do and you &apos;re not even sure if they are trying ,  or if they even care .
 people who care will actually do something about it .
 they will drag you out of bed ,  kicking and screaming to get you to a hospital ,  or a mental institute ,  or a appointment with a therapist ,  or psychologist .
 and the only reason i ever got better was because someone physically forced me to leave my house and see a doctor .
 and even after being denied and confused about where to find help ,  he spent the entire day with me ,  driving around town to different hospital locations to find me a psychologist .
 because that &apos;s what good friends fucking do .
 so stop telling people that you are there just to talk ,  and instead actually take action to help them .
 people who have depression are so enclosed within their room that they can &apos;t reach out to people ,  and that is why people are dying from suicide .
 my two friends who both died at such an early age to depression ,  they were two of the most beautiful ,  kind ,  popular ,  and loving people i have ever met ,  and i always feels so fucking heart broken that i didn &apos;t know what to do until it was too late .
 i tried to kill myself 15 years ago due to chronic shooting pain in my head that no one could diagnose .
 luckily i failed and eventually they went away on their own .
 i have a good life and a great family right now .
 my son was recently diagnosed with chronic headaches and i’ve never been more terrified that once he gets tired of living in pain he’s going to follow in my footsteps .
 he is in therapy but i am just so scared .
 this comment will get buried ,  but my brother killed himself on his 24th birthday .
 he never left a note ,  and always seemed so happy .
 he had a ton of friends and i’ll never really have an answer or closure .
 not knowing why has always been the hardest part .
 i got treated like shit by family and friends after he died .
 everyone treated me like i had some sort of contagious disease .
 every time a public figure dies by suicide ,  i always feel sick to my stomach .
 in the us ,  the mentally ill are disproportionately ignored and stigmatized .
 i really wish nobody ever had to go through a loss like this .
 suicide is 100% preventable ,  yet nobody cares .
 when i was 19 i got into a silly immature argument with my ex over a white lie .
 turns out that was the tip of the iceberg and she took her own life .
 on top of that i &apos;ve been back and forth to the doctors myself (uk) for 12 years now and finally been diagnosed with bpd on top of depression and anxiety .
 i have no goals or aspirations ,  struggling to grasp onto the last of the enjoyment in my interests if any and i &apos;m really at the peak of what i can cope with .
 constantly use dark humour to shadow over how i really feel .
 been through 12 jobs in the last year some of which i didn &apos;t go back after the first day .
 to the point where i idolise the toxic live streaming environment but like most things give up before i &apos;ve even really tried .
 i kinda hate when someone famous dies because everyone jumps on the band wagon of being supportive for a week then it all disappears and no one ever thinks to reach out to people struggling but will happily share a post .
 i &apos;m not talking about myself either i &apos;m talking about those worse off than me .
 tldr depressed ramble .
 - if anyone for whatever reason wants to know more details on anything i &apos;m more than happy to share the fine details i just originally replied from my phone .
 all of my life my dad would attempt suicide ,  i couldn &apos;t even give a rough guess how many times !
 one of my earliest memories was finding my mum crying in her bedroom holding a noose that she had found in the loft .
 (i didn &apos;t understand at the time) .
 it took me a long time to realise that - actually ,  its not normal for a parent to drink themselves into oblivion and take a handful of drugs or slit their wrists !
 he was later diagnosed with bipolar .
 fast forward when i was a teenager my parents had split up ,  dad was steeply declining in his mental health ,  still drinking heavily .
 still attempting/threatening suicide almost weekly .
 he would attempt to run into walls with knives against his stomach until i &apos;d grab him ,  constantly overdose .
 my mum then remarried .
 i always felt a responsibility to keep my dad happy and safe so left my mums wedding early to meet my dad to make sure he was holding up ok .
 of course we met in the pub ,  still in my bridesmaid dress ,  my dad walked over to me very wobbly - i assumed he was drunk .
 he flopped his arm around me and told me he was going to get another drink as he walked away my dress was completely covered in blood  across my waist .
 he had slit his wrist in a zig zag from inner elbow to his hand .
 i told the barman what had happened ,  walked out the door ,  burst into tears and ran 2 miles home .
 at this stage i had completely had enough ,  i remember vividly thinking  &apos;i just wish he would get it over and done with so i don &apos;t have to deal with it !
 but still i went up every day to make sure he was eating ,  taking his meds and generally keeping him company .
 at 15 i hadn &apos;t been up in around a week ,  my best friend and i had planned a girls night around our mutual friends house and popped in to see my dad on the way over .
 as soon as i walked into the communal corridor i smelt it .
 found him led on his living room floor ,  flat on his back with his eyes open .
 flies crawling on his arms .
 called for an ambulance (silly - i know ,  i was 15 and thought they could save him)  .
 i don &apos;t think anyone realises the physical pain of being told  &apos;i &apos;m sorry he &apos;s been gone for some time ,  there &apos;s nothing we can do) until they go through it ,  it feels like a knife to the chest .
 the aftermath of so many  &apos;i didn &apos;t think he would ever actually do it &apos;s &apos; was astounding .
 please ,  if ever somebody tells you somebody self harms for attention ,  take them damn seriously .
 there are only so many cries of help people can give !
 i &apos;m scared for my future because i struggle with depression and wonder what my place in life is .
 if talented singers/ chefs/ designers and successful people choose to end their life .
 what is my fate ?
 people who are suicidal feel like they can &apos;t talk about it with anyone because they will be committed ,  drugged and stigmatized .
 we need to have a better outlet for suicide to be discussed without judgment or immediate hospitalization because that is not always the answer .
 a few years ago my dad attempted suicide .
 he and my mom had divorced ,  and he wasn’t coping well .
 drinking a lot ,  punching holes in the walls (though never any violence beyond that) .
 he messaged me one night while i was getting mcdonald’s with my then-boyfriend (i distinctly remember the fries being perfectly hot and salty for some reason) .
 ” for about 20 lines on my phone .
 i panicked and said we needed to go home .
 when i arrived ,  my grandfather was there ,  along with the police and an ambulance .
 i was 100% sure he had died .
 no one would let me into the house or let me see what had happened .
 moments later ,  a few police officers walked him out of the house ,  helping to carry him since he was so drunk .
 he was taken to the hospital .
 when he called me the next morning ,  he said ,  “i can’t tell you how happy i was to wake up today .
 i’m so glad i failed .
 i’ve attempted suicide three times in my life .
 the first i was attempting to slit my wrists and i was stopped by my childhood friend .
 the second i had a gun in mouth and i heard my nephew laugh from across the house & i couldn’t have him see that .
 the third i had accrued a gun ,  picked my location to go out to in a field ,  went to close all of my bank accounts to leave my money for my family .
 my sister found my note ,  told my dad (who is a cop) and his fellow officers picked me up at work and i was hospitalized .
 mental illness needs to be addressed .
 as someone that suffers from it ,  i know how hard it is to talk about let alone live with .
 i spent years being silent about my illness .
 i thought it was my fault & i should be able to handle it .
 it cost me jobs ,  friends ,  & partners .
 it very nearly cost me my life .
 once i was hospitalized i was finally able to receive the help i desperately needed .
 i’m still rebuilding .
 i still struggle .
 but i can now see a light at the end of the tunnel .
 to everyone that suffers from mental illness: i see you ,  i’m here for you ,  and you are not alone .
 the world may seem empty .
 everything may lose its luster .
 just know that there are those who genuinely care for & support you .
 even if you can’t always see or feel it .
 my brother killed himself in 2010 .
 no one saw it coming .
 this is someone who had a very bright future ahead of him .
 he was all set to take over the family business .
 he was a quarter back in high school and also rode dirt bikes ,  and he was really good at both .
 he loved to fish and hunt ,  he was passionate about a lot of things in life ,  especially his 2 year old daughter .
 he had a beautiful and infectious smile .
 anyway ,  he caught his girlfriend cheating on him one night ,  and apparently she was sending him pictures of her with the guy .
 he was heartbroken .
 they had a baby together ,  and lived together .
 i remember him telling me all he wanted was his family back .
 she moved out and shortly after he saw her at a bar with her new boyfriend ,  the bar where both my step sister and step brother worked and one that she knew my brother frequented .
 why she chose to go to that bar with him is beyond me .
 my brother got shitfaced and showed up at her new apartment .
 he pointed the gun at her new boyfriend and when his ex got on the phone with the police ,  he turned it on himself .
 i remember vividly going over there two day after to pick up my niece ,  and the blood stain was still there in the breezeway .
 my dad got a knock on his door at 3am ,  it was two state troopers telling him his only son was gone .
 i remember the phone call ,  my sister telling me he shot himself ,  and it didn’t even fully register .
 all i could do was mutter “is he alive ?
 i remember sitting around my kitchen table with my family ,  all of us just quietly crying .
 my dad almost sold his boat because they would fish together ,  and it was too painful to take it out anymore .
 i’m happy to say that 8 years later my dad just went to lake erie ,  by himself ,  and he said he felt like my brother was on the lake with him .
 it almost gets harder as time goes on because you start to remember less and less about them ,  and the memories are all you have .
 my niece is the spitting image of him ,  having her around is like having a piece of him with us ,  she’s very special to us !
 what his suicide did to me personally is a whole different story .
 he was my best friend ,  and after he died i went down a very dark path .
 i self medicated and became addicted .
 at one point the only thing that was keeping me from hanging myself from a pipe in my basement was that i couldn’t imagine putting my dad through the pain of losing another child .
 the following 5 years after his death i put my family through hell all over again ,  i was still alive but actively trying to kill myself with drugs .
 i have been sober for 4 years ,  have a beautiful son now ,  and i am set to graduate college this december .
 life is pretty good !
 we miss him every day and the pain of losing him will never go away ,  but where there is life ,  there is hope .
 there is never someone who is too far gone or that can’t turn things around ,  i am proof .
 the only reason i’m still here is because i finally surrendered ,  and got the help i needed .
 i wish my brother had done the same .
 none of us had any idea what he was going through mentally .
 if you suspect someone is struggling reach out to them !
 i’m sorry to everyone who lost someone to suicide ,  i know your pain ,  and to those fighting the good fight ,  keep pushing  
 please don &apos;t use the saying  &apos;it &apos;s a permanent solution to a temerapy problem .
 this might be true for someone who suffers from situational depression .
 the depression that goes away .
 for someone with chronic depression it never truly goes away .
 it is not a temporary problem .
 it can be managed .
 you can be better .
 you can learn to live almost normally .
 but when a person has been suffering for years ,  barely living ,  barely able to get out of bed most morning ,  it &apos;s not a temporary problem .
 when i was in my worst depressed state and i heard that saying for the first time ,  what i heard was:  &apos;it &apos;s a permanent solution to a permanent problem &apos; and you know what ?
 that was comforting .
 it was encouraging in the wrong way .
 i wanted to just cease to exist .
 not have to worry about waking up the next morning .
 what got me through was knowing that i would destroy my children &apos;s lives .
 i knew they would blame themselves .
 even if i thought they were better off without me there and that i was damaging them .
 if i took my life it would be much worse for them .
 i started therapy .
 and that was the hardest thing i have ever done .
 just finding a therapist was way harder than it should have been .
 i decided to show my kids that even though i was damaged and broken i could be strong .
 i started being selfish in a good way .
 i started taking care of myself .
 if i couldn &apos;t get out of bed one day i didn &apos;t .
 i only did the bare minimum of what needed to be done .
 i dropped the kids off at school and came home and slept or just watched tv .
 i picked up the kids from school and ordered pizza .
 but i only gave myself one day .
 my therapist called it my isolation day .
 the next morning i got up .
 i set goals for my self .
 when i accomplished that goal i celebrated .
 then set a new one for the next week .
 my first goal was just going to the hardware store and picking out the paint for a furniture refab i wanted to do .
 when i say my therapist next i showed her a picture of my finished project .
 she was so proud of me she hugged me .
 it &apos;s been a long hard journey and it will never end but i have learned to find joy in my life .
 i will never be cured and i will always have bad episodes but that &apos;s ok .
 i know they will end and i can get back to living .
 there &apos;s an organization called  &apos;always keep fighting &apos; i &apos;ve chosen to live by those words .
 when things are bad i take a sharpie and under my watch band write the letters akf .
 i can just look at it remember that i am strong and i can get through this .
 my mom was about to commit suicide after getting diagnosed with depression and nothing seemed to help .
 before she could go through with it ,   she walked by the room my sister and i shared ,  and saw us laughing (we were watching inside out ,  i remember) ,  and she realised how we &apos;ll be crying instead of laughing if she goes through with it ,  so she didn &apos;t do it .
 she hit a rough patch ,  but she tried ketamine and it really seemed to work her her .
 she &apos;s doing a lot better now .
 yesterday i was drying off in the shower when my wife came home ,  so i stayed quiet and hid .
  i heard her go from room to room looking and calling for me for several minutes ,  even going outside twice ,  before finally finding me in the bathroom .
  i asked  &apos;where you worried something happened to me ?
  &apos; and she said  &apos;i was afraid i would find you hanging from the ceiling in the garage .
 i still don &apos;t really think i have a problem .
  everyone gets down sometimes ,  but if someone that close to me is legitimately worried about me ,  i guess i should probably be worried about me too .
 suicide has touched my life in so many ,  sad ways .
 my younger brother was the awkward fat kid .
 as an adult he struggled to find his footing .
 he wanted desperately to find a technology job but the breaks that i stumbled upon somehow avoided him .
 a few years past his 30th birthday he burned down the cabin he rented from our mom with himself inside .
 i &apos;m tearing up right now thinking of all the cool stuff he missed out on .
 he would have loved it !
 we never got to play wow together or fly quadcopters .
 i miss you rick !
 this is not a good thread to read through if you &apos;re struggling with suicidal ideation .
 temptation of suicide is ever present once it &apos;s blossomed ,  i think .
 the idea abates but lingers ,  biding its time .
 you can still have so many things to be happy for ,  so many things to be pollyanna-glad about ,  and still ,  the sticky sweet singsong of ,   &apos;but you could be done .
 you could be over it and not struggling any more .
 you could rest .
  &apos; chirps persistently in your ear .
 many times friends say ,   &apos;come ,  talk to me when you feel this way .
  &apos; therapists ask you to be open with them -  &apos;are you feeling suicidal right now ?
  &apos; at first ,  you want to trust them .
 but - almost always - with friends ,  you end up having to reassure them that you aren &apos;t going to actually go through with it .
 the emotional toll of reassuring someone else when you are already feeling drained and fragile is a lodestone around the neck ,  cement shoes on a river during the first freeze .
 and therapists ,  bless their hearts (and i do mean that in the very southernist way i can manage) ,  tend to react and report you rather than listening .
 say you end up in the hospital because you chose to check yourself in instead of follow through with your plan .
 you may also - as low income - end up in a facility with heavy drug users and addicts and other lost little puppies such as yourself ,  and you &apos;ll get so heavily medicated you walk around in an apathetic fog ,  still struggling to breath in enough air to not die in a way that feels more like murder .
 group therapy will become the bane of your existence .
  &apos;here ,  rip open your wounds in the company of strangers .
 you &apos;re safe here !
  &apos; a perky fresh-out-of-college or drained dead-around-the-eyes doctor will say .
 nurses chat cherrily with patients .
  &apos;oh ,  you &apos;ll be back !
 they always are .
 so you withdraw more .
 you tuck away the horror you feel at the prospect of trudging through more struggles ,  bill roulette and day after day ,  week after week ,  of trudging through the motions at work .
 you hide your loneliness ,   which at times threatens to overwhelm you with a black tidal wave of nothingness ,  under a veneer of cheerfulness and compassion and empathy .
 you learn to make your smile reach your eyes and body language when you want to weep for how much you long to be able to hold out your arms to someone - anyone - and say ,   &apos;help me !
 i just want to belong ,  to fit in ,  to have a place that feels like the home i &apos;ve read of in the stories .
  &apos; but you can &apos;t ,  and so you go about your days smiling but still hearing the quiet weeping of a small child tucked into a corner in the back room of your mind .
 and sometimes the weeping abates ,  and sometimes the beauty and joy around you slip in ,  like glorious little snapshots in a world full of dark gray .
 and you feel content .
 and then ,  not right away ,  but eventually the crying of the small child is audible again .
 and you have to play the game of ,   &apos;reasons - what reasons do i have to stay .
 what reasons do i have that prevent me from leaving .
 suicide can be seen as selfish .
 you like to think you own a piece of those who you love just as you give pieces of yourself to them to cherish as well .
 but sometimes - sometimes - on the days and nights when the weeping is the loudest ,  an inky black ocean of sorrow lapping at your feet as the tide threatens to come up and fully overwhelm you at last ,  as the storm clouds in your mind darken ,  and the apathy threatens to steal your very last sliver of breath from your very lips ,  then yes .
 i can understand - much better than i ever wished to - why the siren song of suicide could overcome a person ,  no matter how hard they tried to fight it .
 and hopefully ,  hopefully ,  if you didn &apos;t before ,  you can now too .
 i attempted suicide by overdose when i was a junior in high school i’m about 22 now so it’s been 6 years .
  i took in the whole 100 count bottle of acetaminophen and i said some “off” things (my goodbyes) to my friends and they noticed and rushed over at midnight to tell my parents something was very wrong and called the ambulance .
  i wouldn’t fess up to what i did but they knew from my eyes that i wasn’t okay either so they took me to the hospital and made me ingest the absolutely horrifying liquid charcoal .
  i threw it up all over myself in the middle of the night but when i woke up at one point i saw my mom turned over praying and crying and i’ll never forget it .
  the other sight that stops me from it all now is my dad crying when they checked me into the ward .
  in all of my life i had never seen him cry except for that one day .
 people out there love you .
  even if you don’t have family that supports you ,  friends are there .
  around two years after that i got pet bunnies and i love them to death .
  i can’t imagine leaving my pets behind and when i get emotionally distressed i go over and pet them in silence and it helps me calm down a little more and straighten myself out .
  it’s hard ,  but it’s something .
      therapy helped me and my family open up to each other about things that i kept in that caused me to go over the edge .
  now ,  especially being someone who knows first hand what that dark void feels like i push to help my friends around me if i feel like they’re going through the same thing .
 i was suicidal for years; i’m now on medication and am much more stable ,  emotionally .
 the itch to end my life hasn’t gone away ,  but it’s now an impulse that i can control ,  logic my way out of ,  and distract myself from .
 i see so many posts after tragedies like these ,  saying things like “talk to me if you need help , ” and those are good .
 but ,  it’s not enough .
 seek out people in your life who are depressed or seem off .
 listen to them ,  empathize with them .
 don’t treat their feelings as trivial ,  regardless of what you think of their life .
 have unconditional positive regard for every human being you encounter .
 not everyone who is depressed or suicidal will reach out; for some ,  it’s too hard or they don’t want to bother people or they don’t think they’re worth it .
 that’s where we ,  the stable people in their lives need to do better .
 it’s not our responsibility to save them ,  or even make them feel loved .
 it’s our job to listen and do the best we can to be a good human being .
 i &apos;ve been suicidal for years .
 chronic depression and bipolar will do that .
 my young children keep me alive .
 i &apos;ve been struggling with depression and bi polar all my life .
 it &apos;s getting worse now that i &apos;m older .
 i broke down to my girlfriend about a month ago ,  bawling .
 admitted i was tired of life in general and that i just don &apos;t have faith in myself as a person .
 i feel bland and boring and my social anxiety just always makes it worse in social situations .
 that brings me to this ,  i &apos;m out of town this weekend to hang out with my girlfriend &apos;s friends and i don &apos;t know them too well .
 i really need help coping and trying to enjoy myself .
 i &apos;m worried if i don &apos;t enjoy myself and let my anxiety get the best of me ,  i &apos;ll spiral even worse when i get back home .
 from any adjusted person any help ?
 my best friend killed herself in 2009 by walking into the baltic sea one morning in mid winter .
 it is nearly ten years but i think of her everyday and how i didn &apos;t do enough to save her .
 it is cliche to say but she was too sweet for this world ,  too sensitive and too child-like .
 i    &apos;m often very angry at her for leaving for me but sometimes i feel jealous she had the balls to do it ,  as i struggle with my own feelings of suicide .
 i’ve attempted three times and the first few days afterwards are always surreal .
 this last time i drove out to my favorite secluded hiking trail and sat in the snow and cried .
 i cried because i was so full of hope and happiness as a kid and i was angry at myself for letting that child down .
 on the way back to town i bought groceries for the next week as a way of promising myself to live .
 mental illness is fucking nasty but i’ve never once regretted my decision to keep going .
 there’s still a chance i’ll make the child in me proud and that’s what i hold on to when times get tough .
 how can non-suicidal people understand severe depression better so we can look for signs and help our friends and family ?
 i think one of the biggest issues leading to this uptick is how incredibly isolated we all are these days .
 there is no sense of community anywhere .
 a lot of us are renters so we never develop a sense of community where we live .
 we’re always job hopping so there is no sense of community there .
 american society is one of hyperindividuality ,  and people just didn’t evolve to function like that .
 yeah ,  we’re all in debt up to our eyeballs ,  we all work crazy work hours for well under what we’re worth ,  we’re constantly bombarded by 24/7 media stimuli ,  but at least people in the past had their community to rely on when life went to shit .
 i know the intentions are the best ,  but posting numbers to a suicide hotline and saying “go find someone to talk to” are kind of the equivalent of “thoughts and prayers” after a tragedy .
 i think we really need to re-evaluate the direction our culture is moving .
 i was just on a train to cardiff when the train stopped .
 a there was a woman in distress and was possibly suicidal on the next platform .
 the train conductor called for help and stayed with her because he didn &apos;t want to just get her out the way and drive off .
 thanks to that kind conductor the woman got the help she needed and is in hospital as we speak .
 people can complain about the delays all they want but the conductor was so right to stay with her .
 if you ever read this ,  train conductor man ,  thankyou so so much .
 this could have gone a lot worse than just an hour delay .
 i was gonna commit suicide for a while .
 i had a date planned ,  i had a method ,  i had things i wanted to do and i had done it all ,  i had even practiced what i wanted my note to be ,  i had a glorious vision of people coming back to the area for my funeral and getting together again to have a good time .
 that’s when i realized i was being delusional ,  no one coming to my funeral would be having a good time .
 they would all be miserable .
 the note wouldn’t explain it well enough ,  no matter how many times i rewrote it in my head i couldn’t get it so that people would understand .
 my mother ,  she would never understand ,  ever .
 so ,  i thought about it .
 most of the shit i’m worried about ,  it’s just shit i’m worried about .
 if i just stopped caring about it ,  it would no longer be shit i’m worried about .
 i mean killing myself is the end ,  there is nothing worse that can happen to you at that point ,  the game is over .
 maybe i just needed to start a new game ,  one where i was free from the shit holding me down in this one .
 i decided i would try one more time .
 i’ve already lost this life .
 i’m here ,  about to kill myself tomorrow ,  i’ve lost ,  but i can start a new game ,  one more fucking try .
 this way i can restart my life without ruining the lives of others .
 i mean me taking my life would ruin the lives of so many around me .
 i can’t do that ,  i just want to end mine .
 so i did ,  i ended it by deciding to try again cause fuck it ,  what worse thing could i do that i haven’t already done ?
 the only thing is kill myself ,  so if i don’t do that ,  this new life will be better than the last one .
 i decided to play the game ,  one more time .
 since then i still think about suicide ,  but not multiple times a day .
 i don’t harp on it and dream everyone would be better off without me ,  cause they wouldn’t .
 my parents would be crushed .
 my siblings would be crushed .
 i would have traded my broken ass self for breaking a piece in each of them .
 so anyway ,  one more time ,  can’t hurt any more than it did this time right ?
 one more time ,  and if i fuck up this one ,  it will probably be one more time again .
 i attempted suicide when i was 16 .
 i was depressed ,  and untreated because mental illness just wasn &apos;t something that was recognized in my family .
 i cut my wrists and held them under water .
 the only thing that stopped me was the thought that my 5 year old niece would be the one to find me .
 i didn &apos;t want that .
 so i bandaged up ,  cleaned up ,  and went to lay down to re-evaluate my life .
 probably should have had stitches but i wasn &apos;t ready to admit i had  &apos;problems &apos; .
 i still struggle with my depression .
 i was medicated for a while ,  but i hated the side effects .
 i &apos;m happily married ,  bought a house this year ,  and have a wonderful goddaughter who is an absolute ray of sunshine in my life .
 so the depression is there .
 but the suicidal thoughts aren &apos;t .
 any time it even crosses my mind randomly ,  i remind myself why i &apos;m still here .
 but my life is important to me .
 i want to live to enjoy the good times and fight through the bad .
 i will survive .
 please ,  anyone that reads this .
 if you need help ,  get help .
 your life is worth it .
 there &apos;s a lot of love and support out there if you need it .
 i’m 19 years old and last week i took a fatal amount of prescription drugs hoping to end my life along with a sleeping aid so i wouldn’t be awake through it .
 i woke up violently vomiting and extremely upset because i shouldn’t be here .
 i still think about suicide every day ,  but not in a really depressed way .
 i feel more like i’m a background character just going with the flow not doing anything to differentiate myself from others .
 my godfather killed himself november 4th 2013 .
 saying he was my godfather just doesn &apos;t do it justice .
 he was more like an older brother to me while he was my parent age he watched me grow and acted like a kid ,  he loved to just come over to my house and sit down in my room for hours keeping me company and playing games with me .
 he marveled at the new technology that came out and how video games were evolving .
 and whenever he would come over when i was with friends we would all run i say hi to him and jump to give him hugs .
 i have a very vivid memory of showing him super mario galaxy when it came out and playing on the world with the water bowl and swinging in circles on a vine .
 he thought it was the coolest thing in the world replying  &apos;wow .
  &apos; he seemed to be the only adult in my life that still wanted to keep up on what i was interested in .
 flash forward to 2013 where i &apos;m a junior in high school .
 i &apos;m having my issues with my mom and he &apos;s been around the house a lot as he &apos;s been feeling down .
 i enjoyed having him here .
 made the house feel more alive and he was someone i could talk to when frustrated .
 i wish i had known how much pain he was in ,  i wish i asked him how he was doing .
 i was not ignorant to his depression but i did not know it &apos;s extent .
 one day i am in my room on my bed and my mother walks to the door .
 i already knew what she was going to say .
 she was crying ,  i knew what had happened .
 my mother and he were very close and during this time i became a support for my mother as well as my other family members .
 i was so worried about them that i feel i barely processed his death even to this day .
 at his funeral i knew that i had to speak ,  he was the closest thing to an older brother i had and i wanted to say that i loved him .
 when i spoke everyone knew who i was .
 i didn &apos;t know how ,  but i came to find out that he had told all of the people in his life who i was ,  how i was growing ,  and the person i was turning into .
 it was too much for me to handle and for the first time since finding out about his death i cried .
 i cried through the words i spoke about how i wish he knew how much i enjoyed hanging out with him ,  how much i loved spending my birthdays with him or walking through rivers together .
 i wish i had given him a call to tell him that i loved him .
 i don &apos;t know if anyone will read this; please if you love someone in your life or know someone who is hurting from depression or anything ,  give them a hug ,  call them and tell them you love them .
 don &apos;t wait like me .
 i have that suicidal ideation .
 i feel it deeply ,  and often ,  and i can honestly and openly say that i wish i wasn’t alive most of the time .
 i also feel that “reaching out and getting help” will only lead to more debt ,  which will exaggerate a lot of my problems .
 i foresee that debt in the form of paying for a service to try and make me feel better or even the cost of depresssion medication .
 then god only knows what side effects would come with that ,  etc .
 i feel trapped most of the time .
 i owe more than my salary in student loans ,  which means i’ll likely never be able to marry or own a home or really make any decision at all that is bigger than buying a video game or two .
