 question per title
 small head dont wear big hat yo
 still got another source of income
 and can turn out well .
 if prices appreciate .
 or turn out very bad .
 at this moment .
 the bad outcome seems more likely if the person lose his job  .
 which is likely with the covid still raging on .
  and foreigners cannot come into singapore in large numbers to rent your property .
 i realise u everyday ask questions about salary ,  car and condo 
 ask yourself ,  want face or want later end up broke ?
 then if u buy condo ,  u need what car to suit yr condo  ?
 a simple conti car monthly oso need 2k+ ,  haven count petrol etc .
 left 5k ,  after pay condo ,  u left with what ?
 if u go ktv every day sure cannot la .

 5 hours ,  and knn they still forgetted one of my order .
 cant remember whats the name of the bar restoran
 what is worst than eating lunch alone daily with oni cai png and 2 veg cos im too poor and unpopular .
 cant remember the exact details .
 can oni roughly remember the ahtiong server quite curt .
 enter the restaurant but he stood behind the counter .
 oni my husband and i nia but he like not keen to bring menu or even greet .
 i guess it was a huge contrast to the rest of the dining places in nz .
 we had to asked for menu ,  then the food oso not up to expectation .
 too sour ,  too oily and average .
 well ,  wont be returning .
 went cos i was craving for something similar to dtf .
 in new zealand ?
 zhou &apos;s dumplings or something like that
 do people really care about that ?
 must be luis suárez fault
 i see “book” being mentioned .
 so this was timed to sell his book ?
  he didn’t want to reveal it when policed checked on him when he was 24 why now at 40 ?
 yes i think so .
 a man was charged on wednesday (29 january) .
 this is old news or future news ?
 if get maximun 5 years jail ,  song bo
 no la ,  the better malls and places use a system whereby if chiu had checked in before and chiu try to scan again ,  it will be revealed as chiu had oredi done so based on the last 4 digits of your nric .
 a fool is born every minute .
 there’s too many things chiu don’t know it’s all about monitoring and controlling .
 more will come  .
 the app oso dont show the face to confirm the status with the face what .
 how exactly do they catch these people ?
 they oredi say tracetogether can be used for criminal activity
 the reported very blur .
 more like 29 december 2021 (wednesday)
 seems typo ,  should be 29 december .
 >if convicted of cheating by personation ,  kiran may be jailed for five years ,  fined ,  or both .
 serious men ,  liddat five years ?
 should go rob banks roi better
 should put the singh and that guy behind bar .
 it &apos;s as good as attempted murder ah .
 why isnt the other jhk ft charged as well ?
 both of them are bloody jhk fts .
 so is catched on the spot .
 the staff so sharp can catch these people trying to sneak in with other people vaccination status .
 in before driver road kill jail oso 2 weeks nia .
 should’ve caned this jhk
 isn’t it so much more convenient for the staff to just close an eye instead of the need to expose him and to file a police statement and stand as a witness if he claim trial .
 so mah fun for an offence that does not hurt anyone .
 but i never check out one leh .
 and i can check into the same mall again .
 the walking deads are coming .
 maybe some will transform into mutants ?

 wa we beat 50 countries
 well done ,  easy to read their ranking from the bottom of the list .
 on august 1993 ,  singapore recorded its highest standing in the fifa world ranking at 73rd spot ,  thanks to its dream team featuring lim tong hai .

 wasting her youth for him sia
 those small small condo 500-600 sqft .
 not really 2 room .
 more like study room
 he oredi jiaked the last few years of her shelf life still want to delay marriage
 felicia chin 36 years old ?
 another old cow eat young grass couple ?
 why other expats for deported for flouting the covid rules .

 many ktv at bendeemer area 
 shane bao go to jail while this guy bought condo
 huh ,  should be young cow eat old grass la !
 erm this unit is his snack house ?
 then felicia how ?
 looking at the youtube photo (not clicking !
 more like wasting his youth for her .
 he didnt know a pmet ceca leaked the virus back to our community ?
 changi business park is ghosts or humans ?
 i oredi said most of those coming in are not the pmets but the construction workers .
 the new cluster is by sika researcher .
 lw try to bluff limpeh .
 many in it and finance ,  no  ?
 the university research case from construction ,  marine and process  ?
 go cbp plenty  ?
 hello chennai business park is situated on mars is it ?
 not considered part of singapore is it ?
 that is a known secret .
 what he referred was most of them work in those industries and lives in dormitories .
 maybe it &apos;s way lesser than the construction ,  marine and process sectors .
 can be 300k in construction ,  marine and process sectors .
 and 100k in cbp .
 so not wrong to say mostly from construction ,  marine and process sectors
 this one very serious .
 should catch and fine him 9696 .
 not most of them ?
 trying to blend ft as fw  ?
 conveniently left out the ceca pmets ?
 he even forgot the recently reported nus senior researcher ,  accountant ,  and bank employee ,  all of which are ceca ?
 lawrence ,  get real  !
 even if they r mws just arrived ,  weekends still see n piak fdws ,  or go mustafa / tekka market .
 they still can pass the virus even asymptomatic .
 but they are stuck in dorms while ceca pmet having picnic at east coast ?
 notice the choice of words he used .
 then whose great idea to over rely on india labour ?
 all the miw cannot differentiate between ft and fw .
 knn no wonder singapore gahment from bad to worse .
 lw should very happy about one thing today about the appointment .
 i believe oyk would be able to handle all the press conference on his own .
 he will not be receiving any taiji stroke from the guy sitting on the rh side of him during the future conference .
 he will have more time to go over his script before he is appointed to address the q&a .
 the taiji master should be happy to be out of the limelight and dunnid to display his master kung fu any more .
 lw ,  if really oni construction workers ,  then why many ltvp ,  dp ?
 why many shn in hotels ?
 help those that want to be helped should be okey le .
 sometimes kindness is a weakness .
 learnt it the hard way .
 repeated reported thread for no head no tail .
 mtf prease notice this thread !
 then when chiu are old ,  people will tell u what u just said .
 this have nth to do with mtf ,  dont anyhow stir 
 huh got same thread ah ?
 i tell edmw mods to combine .
 what &apos;s the last part [wrong] gotta do w/ old age ?
 my idol conor mcgreggor said the same thing  !
 “if chiu disrespect the person &apos;s kindness and take it as a weakness chiu must pay tomorrow” mcgregor​ .
 when i say help those that wanted to be helped ,  i mean help those regardless of age mah .
 i do no discriminate the old as well .
 in fact ,  age should not be the consideration mah .
 i would say ,  dont take kindness as my weakness .
 one day chiu will become old nor .
 when u are wrong then confess ,  easier to move on .
 else become compulsive liar like some famous youtuber now .
 are chiu oso a conor fan  ?
 pap will help their old cronies .
 so many fat and useless paper generals still get parachuted to jobs
 wa liddat that means young oso pointless ,  can go bedok reservoir liao .
 what happened to make chiu feel this way ?
 some angmo study oso claimed that some wuhan virus victims may oso become imh patients ,  like start to hear voices in their head ?
 that why the researchers believe that the virus may be able to do harm to our brains and nerves system .
 might as well say take over the human brain and body .
 thought  they do autopsy on covid deceased but din find virus in the brain
 if this is the start of movies &apos; zombies ,  it &apos;s really scary .
 lol this is inspired
 virus always mutating and the first iteration was to bluff the researchers .
 oredi kena anal swabbed by atb
 time for bill gqtes to huat
 ground zero patient might be moth
 this condition is quite bizarre !
 very scare it makes raw blood and human flesh smells like food !
  then i can sell impossible burgers using sai .
 investing in durian business now !
 parosmia is dysfunctional smell detection characterized by the inability of the brain to correctly identify an odor &apos;s  &apos;natural &apos; smell .
 instead ,  the natural odor is usually transformed into an unpleasant aroma ,  typically a  &apos; &apos;burned ,  &apos;  &apos;rotting ,  &apos;  &apos;fecal ,  &apos; or  &apos;chemical &apos; smell &apos; .
 next time chio bu fart will really smell like perfume
 it the smell of the waygu beef lungs .
 many cells uplorried in the lungs due to wuhan .
 dont tell no rot smell .
 sekali got craving for brains .
 means amdl smell good and asian chio bu smell bad
 haha that sucks .
 aussie is damn shit .
 alot of sinkies regret .
 come back with tail between legs .
 i dunno who step on your tail but definitely not moi .
 can tell u quite buay gan by insisting on your statements .
 buay gan is obviously not me la .
 maybe for someone who cmi has to go aussieland lor .
 but i know theres a big buay gum guan loser here la hahah
 can tell u a bit siao lang can derail thread until like this .
 wont entertain u anymore .
 if u really feel triggered ,  can leave this thread and go other threads ba .
 in her case she made use of ida/sg credibility to mask her fake degree in amurica ,  which i belv she &apos;s there now .
 sgps in high demand overseas due to our work ethics n legit certs ,  n many of these scums spoil our  name cos i met them there n they bragged they &apos;re  from singapore ,  but same accent n lies .
 our g keep giving prs like toilet paper
 chiu are just one of my entertainment ,  correct .
 but chiu boring la .
 give pr like toilet paper ,  i believe  .
 cause my wife got offered pr few times ,  but she rather just stay on ltvp+ .
 there is nothing wrong with using a stepping stone tho .
 like u work for lao pok smc company so u can work for western mnc later on .
 everyone is like this wat
 where say catched on the spot ?
 meanwhile hordes of foreigners with dubious vaccination status are let in daily .
 think many things many people not aware until they are caught
 implment tracetogether chip in ic
 please hang him
 if gahment discriminated the unvax ,  the unvax should discriminate the vds and avoid these entries (even if vaccinated) .
  &apos;about marriage ,  which ,  by the way ,  still won’t be happening any time soon for him and felicia .
 “a lot of couples in singapore get married very quickly ,  but getting to know each other is a lifelong process ,  and today’s ‘fast food culture’ shouldn’t apply to marriage or it’ll be very unstable , ” he mused .
 oredi 6 years liao where got fast food ?
 really can talk his way out .
 need wait until 12 years then safer meh !
 so small how to piak felicia from kitchen to balcony
 should be good business
 i hope they do one in the north .
 jurong east got 2 ****ing side by side .
 maybe get featured in stranger things ad .
 can open in north point city .
 the crowd there quite good .
 if open in yishun i think the people might become more atas .
 proud of our lions achievement
 myanmar and pinoys now higher than singapore .
 50th best team in the world ok .
 if the rankings were upside down that is .
 vietnamese netizens often regard sea as the  &apos;bottom &apos; area of the football world .
 really is cmi .
 so the world cup dream still on ?
 or continue dreaming lol
 same same but different   
 iceland oso not all full time
 same as newspaper ?
 they regard sea as the  &apos;bottom &apos; ,  but they themselves treat the suzuki cup so seriously and they celebrate their victory parade like as if the sea tournament is the  &apos;top &apos; area of the football world 
 yah indeed we a bunch of hypocrites mah 
 i do remember a bit of dollah kassim ,  rajagopal ,  quah kim song but dont have a lasting memory so i cant tell who is the greatest sinkie footballer .
 most old timers would say dollah or quah .
 but the 2 i have seen that are great are .
 special mentions to baikakki and subramani whom i referred whilst they were young teenagers .
 both are very disciplined .
 another good player was nazri nasir .
 but it &apos;s between fandi and sundram .
 i would say sundram is probably by a small margin the better player .
 skill wise and natural ability .
 but take nothing away from fandi .
 he was truly very disciplined and strove to improve himself and thus had a longer and more successful career than sundram .
 unlike many players from his era or before that ,  most after reaching the local heights - malaysia cup and representing singapore would kind of relak a bit but not fandi .
 what he lacked in skill ,  he strove to improve by self training and hard work .
 sundram had a bit of a party animal in him .
 so greatest that i have seen would have to go to fandi but best would be sundram .
 there &apos;s a slight difference between the 2 accolades .
 once upon a time ,  the football league in sinkieland is semi pro one and sinkieland together with thailand and maybe malaysia were the best team in the region .
 everything went downhill when they turn the league into a pro one .
 and by the way ,  jin xiasuay that both the media and football are ranked 160 in the world
 wow this is such a solid analysis
 viet should have some fatigue legs .
 they participating in suzuki cup ,  asia cup ,  world cup qual ,  so they should choose which tournament they want to prioritise .
 as for singapore lions ,  they oni have suzuki cup to focus on without much distraction
 160th best team —> this sentence  sounds weird
 not bad not bad ,  we are in the top 160
 not bad ,  same as out press freedom ranking .
 can change title to 50th worst team ?
 then just send them to us .
 sinkie land oso turn refugees away how come us never outcry .
 they dont get in  ,  so nothing to worry about here .
 cos my flip prata ,  they kpkb nobody help and offer their help as most are muslim ,  then now want to send them back cos cannot afford to have them ard or they have learned the hard way why myanmar don’t want them in the first place
 show off their condos  .
 and landed properties on social media ?
 isnt thats what social media is for ?
 bragging & humblebragging
 u pcc and cum on their face when have opportunity and then run away
 true ,  but they could be more subtle about it .
 chiu will earn their respect if chiu show off your condom and mistress on the social media .
 wow thanks for iging .
 show off my hdb back .
 they may think they &apos;re being  &apos;subtle &apos; enough to do it online .
 if not subtle is do it irl .
 diff people diff .
 u cant control what they do but u can control yourself .
 mute ,  ignore ,  unfriend ,  unfollow - so many choices at yr disposal .
 chiu can try to doxx them by dm them their address down to the unit number .
 remember watching some documentary couple years back about how some stalkers managed to dig the address of some celebs down to the unit they are staying in and their daily schedules by just analysing the small details in the photos they posted on their social media .
 just saying ,  dont get so worked up lol .
 she super famous in tiktok now .
 every1 using her voice to make beedio .
 not that hard to do actually .
 just need some patience .
 iirc ,  mediacock talking point ever got a couple of bloggers ,  i repeat ,  bloggers who managed to csi where the host is living down to his unit number from studying his social media posts .
 i still remembered how his jaws dropped when the bloggers handed him the  &apos;search results &apos; .
 chiu can always unfriend them if chiu dont like them posting on social media
 they happy jiu hao
 not everyone knows the art of humble bragging .
 *flicks hair back*
 it is normal for humans to flaunt their wealth mah .
 and we are still waiting for vaccine cos who said so
 that day i saw one ft never wear mask .
 i wanted to go say him but i thought about it ,  what if next time he beat me up since i stay in the same area .
 in the end ,  i just diam diam walk away
 dont talk back to your master
 no ,  i &apos;ll npnt in edmw instead .
 if ft ,  got crowd ,  i &apos;ll chide  .
 but some people i say ,  and it &apos;s really they forget and u-turn back home .
 in case siaolang ask me for badge 
 just forgot to put mask a few days ago cos i had to pass something to my customer .
 when i realized it ,  i really jitao jog on the spot after office hours .
 heng i was in pt kit .
 no ,  let the authorities do their job
 wait tio whack how ?
 nowadays nobody wanna lift a finger to help except to take video and post online .
 if u tio whack & cry rik a guniang .
 kena posted on tik tok fb edmw .
 duno admin will help chiu leemove thread or notch ,  maybe  at best help chiu mosaic face
 maybe can ask them if they mask is hard to breathe or ill-fitting and give them a mask for them to try instead .
  usually most will paiseh n pull up their mask .
 if they accept good no harm ?
 if bigger size than me ,  of course better for me to be hum n ignore pretend no see walk away .
 if lower grass ses like fw ,  can act moral high horse and kan
 y u scared he beat u up ,  not scared he pass virus to u if u walk up to him ?
 after all he is maskless ?
 isnt that the reason u want him to wear mask in the first place ?
 cos u scared he spreading virus right ?
 was at gp clinic to see doctor .
 got a group of 3 foreign looking patients pull down mask to chit chat .
 they oso had the moh form from doctor to do swab test at sash clinic ,  potential infected cases .
 the clinic assistant did not force them to wear mask so nothing i could do .
 need effort and i can’t be bothered .
 no vigilante actions preash .
 if u kena beat ,  u may be left on your own to file magistrates report ,  pay for medical checkups etc .
 if kena film getting the shit beaten out of u ,  people will laugh at u for being weak .
 other people die is not my problem .
 u so eat full nothing to do ?
 last month i was on the mrt towards boon lay and halfway one skinny ah bang boarded and he sat opposite of me (those 2 seater seat) .
 though he has a mask but the mask was pull down to his chin leaving his mouth and nose expose and there a guy sitting beside him but was busy texting and listening to music .
 next the guy alighted and a elderly boarded and sat beside him and oso never caution him .
 when i alight at boon lay ,  he still on the train with his face expose .
 since no one bother to ,  i mind my own business ,  dont want later like the mrt incident where the bui bui kena ko by the muay thai ah bang 
 report to sgsecure .
 tell them straight
 knn so high tech
 dont think it is him la .
 dont look like at all leh .
 wa sibei talent .
 can help me edit videos or not .
 must be chiu lah
 what program or app they use to make ?
 scrabby ong angree liao
 can put tpl face on jav ?
 so many deepfake videos now .
 this one will cause chiu to lim kopi
 dont insult joker .
 is he happy now ?
 some subtitles would be oscar shortlist liao .
 wuhan i meant cheena .
 indian i meant south asia .
 var says no goals
 never got 1 last hurrah eating the buffet 
 buffet will be a thing of the past in the post covid world .
 feel sad for bbfas
 your sia doing well ?
 in fact ,  i missed all buffets .
 its the joy of recee left and right for food that makes the buffet experience .
 usually got abang friends they will jio chiu go eat seoul garden lo
 is jin ho jiak
 love buffets where they bring the food to chiu .
 kids will probably miss the experience of running about checking all the stations .
 seoul gardan getting more and more ex leh
 pm elect now can all bird talk .
 cecapura is fked
 i think at this juncture ,  no body cares about miw &apos;s word play .
 they think sinkies are idiots anyway
 maybe start giving them pr so they can stay here and want to stay here to work
 categorically if he wrong placed his emphasis and dealt with the problems incorrectly ,  we will all be in trouble .
 fearmongering with words like impacted construction (bto) etc .
 but who open the flood gate without strict border control ?
 virus flew in itself at changi isit ?
 im not concerned with those india indians dorm workers .
 they are confined to work sites and dorm .
 it &apos;s those disgusting sp and ep ceca who mix in our community who will spread their disgusting diseases to us .
 they always mention the low ses workers but dont dare to stop the rameshes  from entering .
 if they ended up fixing the wrong problem in dormitories than in hotels ,  we will end up with more covid .
 melville park ,  mandarin gardens are dorms meh ?
 what is he talking abt
 he mentioned that india indian restrictions will impact bto and construction .
 these areas should oso be designated as dorms asap oredi .
 they dare not talked abt high ses ceca
 conveniently he left out ceca again .
 liddat can be fm ?
 need to take pic of my birdy .
 mistake to be overly reliant on any particular  source for labour .
 covid has exposed several weaknesses in our ways of doing things .
 meaning we need them back as soon as possible ?
 he is trying to do a zhuge liang stunt trying to confuse people .
 those ceca coming in are pmet ,  not construction workers .
 air tickets cost a bomb nowadays ,  those construction workers wont afford .
 dont have indian oso have bangla ,  myanmar and other construction workers .
 many india indians oso stay along all the condos at ecp
 those in dorms are bangladeshi not cecas .
  moi go bedok reservoir see got long queue .
 too sianz to wait to jump so come back home and muddy alone instead .
 but my cpf got in no out… .
 wa so long no see your post !

 just sticking to my usual chit chat threads .
 so much anger and negativity around .
 more so than usual .
  cut down on my trolling lor .
 @runforyourlife  ,  u suddenly talk like this i very worry ,  see open a bit hor ,  n go listen to your wu yue tian to destress loh
 was expecting a nonsense karma thread ,  but the content turn out ok ,  fostering a good culture is definitely the way to go 
 yup ,  but if some dont deserve the help(abusing your kindness ,  never appreciate ,  scold chiu back instead) then let them be .
 after i make her come then she will turn around and make me come
 tell it to calvin  &apos;car chng &apos; cheng
 i like the new edmw moderators ,  very matured and with rational thinking ,  not like those in the past with lotsof ginna pis .
 i am oredi old and weak .
 probably a good respite from oyk and ceca thread
 i think my ns changed me alot too .
 my outlook and thinking before and after ns very different .
 after ns ,  some of the observations from edmw seems to validate my experience bah .
 some individuals are notoriously cunning and some superiors are fking cb .
 thish is the narratives of the entitled old unreasonable people .
 if chiu find a way to not get old ,  let me know  
 nothing wrong with getting old .
 sho long as i is not entitled and unreasonable .
 and use quotes like the above to justify old me being entitled and unreasonable .
 confusion philisophy teach this .
 but reality teach us the opposite is true .
 just saw at dome 3 under vpremium .
 they really think sinkies are carrot head  ?
 viet bu is from 3rd world kampong country .
 ever heard the concept supply and demand ?
 chiu from which era ?
 the chio ones oredi 300/1/1 some time ago .
 u think your money cow cart wheel ar ?
 wa  , if  doing grabfood have to run 60-70 trips to fuxk this sh1t one time
 they are thinking sinkies pay are like ceca  .
 20k per month where in reality mostly is 2k to 3k per month .
 his name got 80 so he think is $80 lor .
 si gina ghost back stardee mai cum this type forums
  really leegret never whack when studying that time .

 previously was around 260~270
 ts so innocent to think sinkies wont accept that offer  
 if u need to ask this ,  your in the wrong thread my friend
 what ts expect .
 is like hdb de mah .
 low demand will cheaper if high demand sibei sexpensive de ler later cum out the news say which okt is arrested or burst liao then the price conberm will go up like hdb .
 gahment cum out news say few vendor cannot tahan then hdb price pew pew up liao .
 just blame ownself too poor to get it
 moi nono that is why moi ask
 even $2-3k once awhile oso can afford some luxuries .
 but sky high prices mostly aim at those high earners or those who do pian one lor .
 even locals $1k+ a shot rich people dont mind pay .
 why do chiu need to deal with them  ?
 ts ,  have it ever occur to chiu why chiu wasting your own time on other people life  ?
 that is what i am doing now .
 but most who own a condo will not show off their kitchen cos it is fuсking small ,  smaller than any hdb flat .
 oh no ts salty again
 straits times can use that heading for their future reporting : .
 “st retains top 160th ranking in press freedom index”
 if he didnt score own goals ,  would we have been higher ?
 why are those jokers at fas still being paid for failures ?
 it &apos;s been years .
 wa the ranking 
 jin satki mens fas !
 actually this is an anomaly .
  north korea &apos;s rank is low cos they havent been playing much and withdrew from the wc qualifiers even .
 a tournament they have qualified twice for and came close to reaching a number of times too .
 they always were a reasonably good football team in the asian context .
 a shade below south korea  ,  iran ,  japan and now of course the aussies .
 but their standard always around the reasonably good middle eastern teams like the saudis or iraqis .
 and when they have better players or on their day they can beat japan or korea .
 youth level oso they were good .
 but it remains to be seen if they can recover quickly from this self-imposed ban .
 if not may take a few more years to reach asia &apos;s top 10 or even higher .
 wa same as state media .
 sama-sama as our media
 lion &apos;s ranking same as sph ranking  
 this is a question of what could have been .
 nobody exactly know the definite answer to it
 where u get all these stats and figures 
 how to slip further if 160 is the last country ?
 coincidence that media and football are both 160 ?
 must be oppositions fault for fielding a bad khan .
 not meant to have this sport .
 no mixed players  .
 cui means cui  !
 vietnam will focus on suzuki cup la .
 vietnam world cup hopes .
 is close to 0% cos they are in a group where at least 4 teams is better than vietnam .
 i bet my kukujiao they would not even finish 4tg in their group .
 as for asia cup ,  they oredi qualified for the 2023 final tournament la n 2023 is still at least a year plus ah .
 spore can oni thrive in m league .
 even got mixed player would not help .
 u all remember this player anders aplin ?
 lion would not even smell the top half of the m league table post 2017 .
 nothing ,  ,  i scared they take umbrage 
 better report to police .
 let police do their job .
 do not try to act like police .
 remb chuir place in the hierarchy before doing anything stupid .
 foreign gamen > miw > elites > ceca > sovereign > ftrash > fw > cats and snails > low ses sinkies
 we dont have a badge .
 furthermore we will get scolded .
 before he beat u ,  u give a punch to his nose first .
 make sure u break his nose bridge and fall to the ground .
 he is yours to take .
 not paid why rat on others .
 doing the gestapos work for free .
 unless got one app credit $500 every report
 u did the right thing .
 wait he dulan beat u up like the guy in the mrt .
 mayb he wearing invisible mask that oni the smart can see ,  low ses sinkie sure cant see
 i wont say anything but will distance myself from the person like he/she &apos;s kind of disease
 just keep silent ,  diam diam stand one side .
 don’t kpo go say the ft or offer them mask .
 there was once i offered a ft from south asia a brand new mask  but said that is dirty asked me to buy a new one  ended up i paid $30+ for a brand new box  of masks for the ft .
 must do risk assessment first .
 if chiu say them ,  following are the possible outcomes: .
 they dont comply ,  scold chiu instead .
 they dont comply ,  saying that they were brisk-walking ,  and may even report chiu for being racist or xenophobic .
 they dont comply ,  and sneeze/cough/spit into your face .
 they dont comply ,  and beat chiu up .
 they dont comply ,  did any of the above mentioned things to chiu ,  and fellow sinkies dont come to your aid and support ,  instead pwn chiu further .
 dont bother ,  chiu not sda
 i see these people everyday leh ,  no mask or mask on chin .
 but i dont dare to go lecture them ,  later kena called racist 
 they wear or dont wear its none of our business they are adult if they get the covid then so be it just protect yourself wearing mask u live longer .
 you’ll be arrested for racism .
 even if you’re the same race
 i scared they ask me “where is your badge ?
 i will not go forward to tell them ,  and quickly walk away .
 think about it .
 u wear mask is to protect others ,  not urself .
 so they dont wear mask u are in danger ,  not them .
 what for i risk myself to argue with those irresponsible people .
 is it very noisy ?
 my condo unit just beside lift ,  convenient and not noisy
 surely not hp right
 condo one maybe made in japan .
   hdb made from cheena one ,  the cheapest type .
  very noisy one .
 generally noise not from lift itself .
 it &apos;s the people using it .
 sometimes people come out will talk loudly one
 technically if the lifts have loud  &apos;ding !
  &apos; sound every single time it opens/closes the door or reaches a floor .
 maybe it can be irritating
 condo got security guard ?
 high ses owner .
 if yr door gd won’t hear .
 but try not to pick unit near or worse facing lift .
 my main door is the lift unit .
 good luck to chiu ts .
 hdb ,  with all the low ses and aliens ,  chiu can expect it to be very noisy .
 at night can hear the lift movement .
 lift not noisy .
 is the si gina ,  neighbours like to gather near lift lobby play and talk loudly .
 sometimes nearby school students will gather there and do some actions .
 unit besides lifts usually comes with central bin .
 u get 2 headaches
 mine is old hdb lift upgrading so there’s one lift to share among 4 houses for every level .
 there’s dingdong but normally cant hear much .
 midnight if v quiet can hear the mechanical thud of the lift when my ear is near the wall .
 new hdb may be noisier cos of thinner walls .
 depends on your tolerance and sensitivity .
 my old place had a lift added after upgrading ,  my new place faces the lift almost directly .
 in both cases ,   i usually do not notice the lifts except when some rhino or bunch of monkey comes running out of it 
 notch really an issue to moi .
 benefits more than bad ones .
 point block sibei song .
 10 steps and chiu are at lift .
 in my situation ,  each floor has 2 units .
 the lift is about 4 steps away from my front door .
 i don’t even notice it .
 door always close who walk pass oso don’t know right ?
 autumn is near good luck to them
 what at the expense of your own people &apos;s well being !
 a sign of things to come ,  trading material for well-being
 when the people drop one by one due to covid ,  good luck to the economy and tourism .
 dont worry ,  even sinkie experts have said it &apos;s like flu
 if chiu take care of your health and maintain a healthy weight with adequate exercise ,  there is no way chiu are dying to covid or even having symptoms .
 personal responsibility > lockdowns
 but the thing is if they dont drop dead one after another then chiu know you &apos;ve been reading fake news ,  your gahment will flip flop their story
 personally if chiu ignore your well being there are plenty of activities that have huge payoffs ,  like being a drug mule ,  or providing sexual services to hiv positive people .
 mask mandates and lockdowns may be doing more harm than good .
 im supporting mr desantis stance on the covid 19 situation all the way (even though im singaporean) .
 he &apos;s an ivy league scholar ,  so im sure he knows what he &apos;s doing .
 very well said… people seem to have “outsourced” personal responsibility of their health over to lockdowns and vaccines and their gahment ,  and worse ,  they want everyone else to do the same
 i wouldnt go so far to say no symptoms ,  but i believe it will be relatively mild .
 just take care of your health and weight .
 then chiu are practically invincible to covid or any other flu .
 its really that simple .
 if chiu are so busy that chiu dont even have time to exercise(which i believe is just an excuse) ,  then chiu have to watch what chiu eat .
 chiu gain weight when chiu consume more calories than chiu burn .
 if chiu dont exercise ,  simply eat lesser .
 maintaining a healthy weight is really the key to longevity .
 wanting more lockdowns and vaccines is just ridiculous .
 millions of people are gonna be pushed into poverty and suicide .
 well then too bad for them .
 chiu dont wanna take care of your own health .
 it will be even more worse if chiu dont take the vaccine .
 we can debate about the effectiveness and purpose of vaccines all we want ,  but it has shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and even death .
 so if chiu are a fat ass and chiu do not even attempt to lose into a healthy weight ,  and still dont take the vaccine ,  then good ****ing luck to chiu .
 lol say that in us chiu will kena sjw &apos;ed for fat shaming .
 but those jobs have little impact to our local industries .
  &apos;many of the new arrivals from india work in the construction ,  marine and process sectors and live in the dormitories &apos; .
 what the fug he talking about .
 whole of sengkang punggol all those ceca are birds ?
 very scary kind that snake u in the back and displace chiur chewren from their jobs and universities .
 now too early to say…
 mean and evil people mistaken kindness for weakness and will try every ways to exploit .

 quickly shun away from them like plague and disease .
 me and my friend invested 2xxk into a company in aug 2019 .
 we did the shares transfer and director inclusion via corp sec .
 the managing director refuse to hand over the bank signatory even after we have added in directorship .
 abruptly in oct 2019 ,  our share holding and directorship was removed from acra by himself holding on to the corp pass ,  without our knowledge and approval .
 the company stopped operations .
 in dec 2919 ,  the managing director of the company called me to assist in a loan repayment citing i am a director in the company .
 i issued a cheque to hong leong finance ,  but the payment is rejected .
 at thus point ,  our names had been removed from acra and the md did not informed us .
 through out the cb period ,  the md just said that due to covid operations had stopped .
 until july 2020 ,  we realised our shareholdings and directionship had been changed without our knowledge .
 we tried to approach the md ,  but he is not contactable .
 does any of this sounds like a cheating case .
 any law enforcement personnel or lawyer care to comment ?
 just call police .
 police bochap ,  say civil case .
 no shareholders agreement ?
 funny story by the way ,  chiu cannot close a company off without all directors signing ,  same with bank account
 the company is not closed down but ceased operations .
 the md refused to hand over signatory after we were added in as director .
 our agreement is that once the company is doing well ,  we will sell back the shares to him .
 what is criminal breach of trust (cbt) ?
 the phrase “criminal breach of trust” (cbt) may sound complicated ,  but let us break it down for chiu .
 cbt usually involves a misuse of funds or property ,  and covers a wide range of activities .
 remember the city harvest church corruption scandal ?
 it was all over the news when the 6 church leaders misused more than $50 million of the church’s funds to further the pop music career of pastor kong hee’s wife .
 this misuse of funds that were entrusted to them by churchgoers is a classic example of cbt .
 other cases of cbt may include dishonestly pawning off a necklace chiu borrowed from your friend .
 elements of criminal breach of trust .
 according to section 405 of the penal code ,  cbt is committed when a person who is entrusted with property ,  or is given control over property ,  dishonestly: .
 misappropriates that property; .
 converts that property for his own use; .
 uses/disposes that property in violation of a law or contract; or .
 deliberately allows another person to do any of the above .
 entrustment: for cbt to be committed ,  a person must be either entrusted with the property ,  or have control over the property .
 entrustment is easily found in cases where a professional receives property .
 for example ,  bankers in charge of transferring money to another account ,  or admin staff who are put in charge of keeping signed cheques ,  are people who have been entrusted with property .
 dishonesty: the person must have oso acted dishonestly .
 this means that they must have had the intention to cause someone (such as themselves) to wrongfully receive a benefit ,  or to wrongfully cause a loss to the victim .
 who is the corp sect
 the corp sec is in yishun and did not have any knowledge of the md transfering back the sharea to himself .
 he has to correct it .
 after the company ceased operations (not closed down) .
 the md transferred back the shares to us .
 we have file a complaint to acra since july 2020 and they have yet to revert back to us .
 yes buddy ,  lawyer say got case ,  police say no case .
 get caught dunno how to proceed .
 lawyer fee 40 plus k .
 sekali come out nothing ,  even more tng kor
 what damages chiu looking for ?
 i understand bro .
 actually i am trying to gather some advice from probably ex agency officers to see what type of evidence is needed to prove my case stronger .
 we will restrict ourselves to within the state court court limit .
 otherwise high court will cost more .
 no ,  as in the  &apos;cheating &apos; what loss was there to chiu ?
 courts can oni recover ,  not enrich .
 how much will u tip each of them  ?
 one from sim one from ri and how much .
 no tips to them at all
 same ranking as our newspaper .
 that guy born in s &apos;pore la .
 he play for hougang via geylang ,  and research shows that he &apos;s the cousin of former s &apos;pore international player tan kim leng
 160 means we better than 50 other countries leh .
 time for pay raise and bonus for fas !
 not noisy for me .
 maybe used to it liao .
 lift normally wont notice much and yeah ,  it &apos;s the people who make alot of noise .
 people using the lift .
 when they come out or wait for lift ,  some will laugh or talk very loudly .
 some lifts will have sound i .
 e pi pi sound ,  opening or closing .
 some lifts even worse ,  will have voices to tell people lift opening or closing too .
 in some situations ,  people who pressed the emergency button mistakenly will affect the units nearby as well .
 lifts & lift users can generate alot of noises if u ask me
 commenter asks lawrence wong if he made  &apos;lousy school &apos; comment in parliament .
 in case chiu wanted to know .
 sounds like his voice
 22 ,  wong uploaded a short video of himself discussing jobs ,  concerns over foreign competition and unfair practices at work ,  and singapore &apos;s necessity of being an open economy ,  despite its downsides .
 in a perfect microcosm of the parliament debate ,  (dex) wong didnt respond to any of the points that (lawrence) wong made ,  and instead asked him whether or not he made those comments about leong .
 then who ah please own up 
 got ghost there
 he never comment to say its wrong to say that ?
 at least he got guts to answer to the question .
 mothership must be fixed !
 who siah who siah .
 not sure about others but for me it did sound like it came from vb
 ah gui deserves a beer for sharing this
 wow lawrence wong for pm !
 self destruct liao ,  every man for himself
 then reveal who is the one .
 he and vb definitely know .
 can believe him or not ?
 how can anyone prove otherwise ?
 given that he cant answer yes he did ,  or not answer at all; which will just imply guilt .
 then who is the one who said that ?
 thought their policy is dont cover up and come out to admit ?
 something else better
 not even a full song… .
 make me buay song
 finally they invented the new maximiser

 too complicated since i hardly get any match so no need ask these qns unless match
 not complicated  .
 just sinkies lack of thinking and easy to con

 those days ,  if heng ,  went supper with chio mms after ktv close ,  and happy ending awaits  .
 *happy ending definition using itil 4 standard: satisfactory outcome perceived by customer that often warrant a returning customer asking for more for the service 
 chiu can dont pay 300 mah if think not worth .
 find two 180 for shuang fei better .
 just use hand la .
 cheaper and safer .
 this kind one anytime will load my army into her
 everyone has a price .
 younger prostitutes cost more of course .
 it is not that i cannot afford the money ,  but i am not that age oredi so i go for horny milfs .
 ktv is per hour can get 300 ?
 i read that they need to verify u one by asking u for your office tel and call your office or u send them your nric/passport   or u friend them in your facebook account .
 siao who would do that .
 maybe those guys with little head thinking
 nsf is now how much ?
 pian almost always make more than legal jobs one .
 oni exception if chiu are the boss and can scale up your business like grab or secretlab ceo .
 chiu must be naive if chiu think ktv girls dont sleep around for money ,  they do too .
 i think they market themselves as premium .
 so their marketing strategy is target rich people .
 so is very niche market and demand can be smaller .
 an average vietnamese salary in hcmc is oni $500-600 .
 seems like the vietbus can earn that in just 2 hours .
 chiu never up any of your female classmates during uni days meh ?
 thats why vietbus like to come here  .
 work for one month is like working 5 years in their village .
 even average one charging 150/1/1  .
 they can easily earn $30k a month .
 (excluding 5 day period) .
 u are a carrot head oni if chiu choose to be one .
 provided there are enough local carrot heads for them to chop .
 thats why study hard earn money is complete nonsense .
 viet uni grad i think make $1k plus a month nia .
 doors full wide !
 same old grandiose talk la .
 stay united we will get through this ,  chiu are not alone blah blah yadah yadah
 announce at noon so early means  &apos;good &apos; news .
 oso nowadays if it is good news he will announce ,  bad news he will leave it to 4g .
 so i am guessing he gonna ease restrictions .
 no more need to test* .
 borders fully opened* .
 everyone can dine out* .
 tracetogether can throw away* .
 healthy no need to wear mask .
 *the above are my guess and are not actual announcements of our beloved pm lee​
 chiong supermarket for groceries tomorrow
 my fellow sinkies ?
 maybe no need to wear masks liao
 cb la ease restrictions at this stage .
 we sure we ready ?
 i think he buay soong international media keep attacking singapore !
 please no easing​
 he said no need to rush to stock up ?
 watch sinkes do the opposite !
 together we can overcome this difficult time .
 all covid restrictions removed
 if not he wont personally announce
 covid has ended .
 my fellow edmw bbfas !
 my fellow sinkies  .
 u invested 2xxk and didnt took part in day to day ops of the business and to rectify internal control issues .
 and now u want 250k back ah
 yes ,   we are seeking to recover part of our investment .
 its not we are not involved .
 we were kept out of the operations .
 m&aa & citing the lack of board/director resolutions probably your best chance right now .
 basically the md is screwed if m&aa is crafted well .
 whatever will be ,  will be .
 we have invested more than quarter mil .
 seeking to recover quarter mil before lawyer fees .
 after lawyer fee ,  we could oni recover maybe 200k ideally
 easy for us to say .
 money not entirely mine
 singapore not loser have to pay your lawyer fees meh ?
 so chiu want court to order he buy chiu all out ie get back investment ?
 judge will send for arbitration .
 tq buddy will look at this route
 maybe the cheater higher ses than chiu thats why the police and lawyer dont agree on assessment of case
 this kind oni can civil lawsuit .
 business issues our law dont really care .
 thanks for the advice .
 the md came to see me with a 3 yrs p .
 from singapore semicon manufacturing company (ssmc)  ,  citing it &apos;s a 3 mil business and he is short of capital .
 i called on a friend to help him .
 we gave the company 2xxk for 51% of his comapny share agreeing to return 31% back to him once his ops stabilised .
 after transfer the shares and money ,  he refused to transfer signatory of bank accout .
 he just mysteriously stopped operation and trf our share holding and directorship .
 and became uncontactable .
 does it sound like we have a case against him ?
 investment fail and chiu want get back your money plus profit .
 but proving expensive
 investment was over quarter mil ,  seeking to recover 200k
 go find lawyer leh ,  its a civil lawsuit oni .
 very hard to say people fraued chiu in investing in company one .

 cheena says  &apos;uyghur tribunal &apos; that found xi responsible for  &apos;genocide &apos; is a farce .
 london: the chinese embassy in london said an unofficial tribunal of lawyers that accused beijing of genocide against the uyghurs was nothing more than a political tool of china &apos;s enemies ,  who were spreading lies .
 the unofficial tribunal of lawyers and campaigners said on thursday (dec 9) that chinese president xi jinping bore primary responsibility for what it said was genocide ,  crimes against humanity and torture of uyghurs and kazakhs in xinjiang .
 an embassy spokesman said it was  &apos;nothing but a political tool used by a few anti-china and separatist elements to deceive and mislead the public &apos; .
  &apos;anyone with conscience and reason will not be deceived or fooled ,  &apos; the spokesman said .
 what the  &apos;tribunal &apos; said .
 the tribunal ,  which is headed by british lawyer geoffrey nice ,  has no powers of sanction or enforcement .
  &apos;the people &apos;s republic of cheena (prc) has committed genocide ,  crimes against humanity and torture against uyghur ,  kazakh and other ethnic minority citizens in the north-west region of cheena known as xinjiang ,  &apos; the british-based uyghur tribunal said on thursday .
  &apos;the tribunal is satisfied that president xi jinping  .
 and other very senior officials in the prc and ccp (chinese communist party) bear primary responsibility for acts that have occurred in xinjiang .
 the world uyghur congress (wuc) ,  which represents the interests of the mostly muslim uyghurs in xinjiang and around the world ,  asked nice in 2020 to set up an independent tribunal to investigate accusations of abuse in xinjiang .
 some foreign lawmakers and parliaments ,  as well as the us secretaries of state in both the biden and trump administrations ,  have labelled the treatment of uyghurs as genocide .
 but cheena vehemently denies that .
 in a statement on thursday ,  its foreign ministry dismissed the wuc as a separatist organisation under the control and funding of anti-china forces in the united states and the west .
  &apos;this so-called court has no legal credentials nor any credibility ,  &apos; a ministry spokesperson said ,  describing the testimony given as false and the final judgment as a  &apos;political farce performed by a few clowns &apos; .
  &apos;lies cannot conceal the truth ,  cannot deceive the international community nor stop the historic course of  .
 xinjiang &apos;s stability ,  development and prosperity ,  &apos; the ministry spokesperson said of the uyghur tribunal .
 un experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people ,  mainly uyghurs and members of other muslim minorities ,  have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in xinjiang .
 cheena initially denied the camps existed but later said they were vocational centres and designed to combat extremism .
 in late 2019 ,  cheena said all people in the camps had  &apos;graduated &apos; .
 the munich-based wuc welcomed the tribunal &apos;s judgment .
 i see face ,  job field and description .
 after that what next ?
 copy from where ?
 people dont even swipe your profile .
 i tell chiu what la .
 swipe right first .

 5 signs you &apos;re dating a liar & here &apos;s how to get yourself out of the mess .
 here are 5 main signs you &apos;re dating a liar: .
 (1) their stories dont match .
 (2) they &apos;re ambiguous when they lie .
 (3) they &apos;re overly secretive .
 (4) they contradict themselves alot .
 (5) they always have an excuse ready ,  for everything
 i think is not allowed leh

 liddat they work 1 months is like work 1 year back in vietnam ?
 half of them are almost fully book .
 330 for one hour one day say 8-10 clients .
 3k x 22days (8days relak do nothing sleep) should be 60k or one year of median sinkie salary or 10 years of vn average pay .
 of course agent and rental need to pay but if she work hard enough .
 six months is more than enough to no need work for rest of life in vn
 no wonder they cause the covid cluster
 thats why they are willing to brave the shame and dangers to work here to earn quick bucks .
 chiu will be surprised just how little they earned back home ,  unless they engaged in some illegal stuff .
 definitely there are some out there ,  need open and see

 u all dont make scrabby ong angry hor later he chut ultimate jinx potion u all sure cannot take it
 very creative wor
 are scrabby and oyk related ?
 what is the app to make like this de ?
 the overlay decent sia .
 scrabby angry someone make a deep fake of himself ?
 he can be an actor next time
 scrabby y u start thread about yourself ?
 deep fakes is really going to cause the world to doubt video evidences in the near future .
 haha ,  and yet gahment & companies are complaining singapore lacks local digital talent - hence need to import foreigners .
 should make this higher instead cos he is laughing at all sinkies .
 in before  &apos;no one insults chiobu &apos;
 anyone know if there &apos;s any app can make jav one
 alot of jav movies being remake with kpop idols nowadays .
 tzuyu jav very popular .
 deep fake so common .
 but many people who read dubious news sources tio pian left right up down
 since your lawyer said got case .
 just file a civil suit .
 but case confirm drag very long .
 yup ,  by right right right ,  corp sec needs to meet up all parties to sign in his/her presence and he/she will endorse .
 but most cases ,  people just pass that document around for the next person to sign .
 yes ,  200k is another issue .
 but step by step first lor ,  have to prove this is unlawful then use the verdict to wack the bugger .
 if he declares bankrupt ,  then slowly get money back if the court rules in the favour
 u invest 2xxk but dont want spend 1k to talk to a lawyer ?
 bankrupt can forget about claiming money liao
 ts chiu need to consult a lawyer not on edmw .
 we have spent more than that to talk to lawyer .
 apparently according to district judge ,  he declated bankrupt in august 2020 .
 but he still has private property under his name and bankrupt registry doesnt have his name .
 what does that mean ?
 chiu read the last financial report and went through lawyer to read the company article or not  .
 really sound like buying vegetable .
 just buy all acra filings 1st so at least chiu know something .
 i have to admit there is an oversight there .
 poh mata + call lawyer for advice .
 $200k not small amount 
 mata say no criminality .
 acra no response*
 shareholders have no right to look at the accounts ,  and are chiu sure that chiu bought ordinary shares .
 he could even done everything legally .
 edmw have queens lawyer .
 please keep paging for this legend to appear .
 my buddy was the share holder and i was appointed director .
 there was no accounts .
 we push him to do it after injection of funds but he never did .
 the transfer of shares part is false declaration i believe .
 basically all this efiling .
 they simplify and let the person doing transaction self declare he have all the consent etc .
 but still wont get your money back .
 its hard to get back if he indeed use the money for company operations .
 unless he use the money to pay himself etc .
 means not acting in the best interest of the company liao .
 get back money is hard .
 all the fees and time spent .
 can get back half oso dont know
 it will be a dragging war for years to hunt down this cheater .
 worth your time and money or not ?
 just social media publish his face and company big big and xiasuay him .
 call newspaper ,  pick up headline ,  let his supplier/clients know .
 means they not going to jab kids for this age group ?
 they are recommending to not vaccinate the healthy teenagers ,  and oni vaccinate those with underlying conditions .
 quoting from the article: .
  &apos;the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation did advise widening the existing vaccine programme to include an extra 200 , 000 teenagers with specific underlying conditions .
 jab liao trigger underlying condition how
 oyk going to pofma these scientists ?
 think so far uk has been consistent and never advocated vaccine for young people
 means they are not going to jab their own kids .
 don’t worry according to mtf everyone has underlying conditions so all will be eligible for jabs under these uk guidelines
 this guy should be taught a lesson .
 but young girls nowadays can oso be irrationally  &apos;brave &apos; ,  can meet him alone in his house and went inside his bedroom .
 hamsup army boy
 she wants his hamster ,  he wants her hum .
 probably cant hold his lust over fresh meat  .

 obv is vivian liao
 i think if lw was the one ,  he wont be so thick skin to openly say he is not the one if vivi is tanking for him .
 he will just remain silent on the matter .
 he openly say hes not the one means ,  its confirm vivi
 the ri comment ,  the tone of that sentence totally different from lousy school comment .
 got @s-ghost in parleement ?
 he chew iron grow big one ah ?
 no ah gui confirm not there
 q: sir ,  did chiu make the  &apos;lousy school &apos; comment ?
 a: no ,  i can assure chiu i did not say the  &apos;lousy school &apos; comment .
 i said in full  &apos;he must be from a lousy school &apos; .
 a: please dont misquote me and quote me out of context .
 satki liao can walk up straight
 obviously it was vivi right ?

 too bad got coward dare say but dont dare admit ,  so he got implicated .
 so did he or not made the comment .
 we are talking about integrity issue here .
 or it was someone else voice .
 the  &apos;lousy school &apos; comment didnt sound like it was from vivian .
  i thought it sounded like lw .
  but i am obviously not correct since lw came out and clarified that it was not him .
 whr are all the masters
 chiu didnt see today &apos;s big story ?

 i google it showed garden by the bay dome ,  so is it go there and find ?
 sinkies still pay for it thats why they come and covid makes prices become black market as supply so low but high demand .
 chiu may think why people so carrothead but to others $300 is just small change like a price of a meal to normal people .

 what will happen if i eat the burger 
 open burger  ,  look through it to see whether spit & mucus in it .
 if tomorrow chiu get diarrhea ,  report sfa & bk hq
 i check oredi nothing .
 maybe he accidentally drop the bun then pat dust off the bun 
 if i were chiu ,   i wont even eat it now if its free .
 and never go back to that branch ever again
 i can do it for ts now
 why raise voice bef your food ready ?

 so obviously dogs can eat almost anything without anything happening to them
 if got pi sai inside u oso donno ,  eat liao oso jin ho jiak
 he pcc inside the mayo chiu oso dunno  .
 thats why i try not to mess with people preparing moi food 
 obviously he cant do that in the short time frame  .
 but its possible to take uncooked patty & rub his bare arse & then fry it
 put in ziplock bag and send it for testing la .
 it &apos;s true ,  i was there heard commotion ,  but dont bother ,  so i proceed to eat my swiss mushroom double and laugh at those 2 idiots
 he has oni himself to blame for not studying hard in school .
 this is his karma .
 i think it &apos;s within dhoby mrt .
 just the other side (near singapore shopping centre) which people dont usually go .
 thats another xchange .
 so to come to think of it ,  i &apos;ve never been to orchard xchange nor heard of it before .
 where is this place even located ?
 how did smrt account for the cost of construction ?
 unless it is subsidised by tax payers and smrt does not care whether they collect rent or not .
 was popular before plaza sing extension siphoned away all the commuters .
 and if tenants are comparing with ion ,  maybe they should oso compare the amount of rent they &apos;re paying  .
 edit my bad i thought the dhoby ghaut one
 thanks to ms saw
 nvm  ,  completely different place lols
 article mentioned next to ion ?
 i thought is wheelock/ wisma ?
 what is this shit place ?
 why they even choose to rent that space ?
 smrt is quite a shitty retail landlord ,  it &apos;s next to ion but not even visible .
 it was forever21 before them iirc ,  all cleared out and partitioned .
 i oni realised that place existed when i was shopping the t2 tea ,  suddenly got one opening that leads to that god forsaken ground .
 is it cos of the way the escalator entry is  ?
 somehow the mrt exit level and basement seems to be most popular .
 the level between ground floor and mrt exit seems like accidentally built .
 this is the taichi master ceo &apos;s legacy .
 supposed to become the main money generating arm of smrt during the rail maintenance negligence years .
 smrt should lease out or sell off the retail assets to a bigger mall player .
 since the beginning ,  never once walk past to even ssrr of what are the stuffs they sell there  .
 usually would just go to the intended mall ,  thats it 
 all i can ask them is ,  who did they vote for ?
 there are tj pagar xchange ,  raffles xchange ,  dhoby gauht xchange and orchard xchange .
 but business damn jialat .
 smrt normally will lease the shop to event organiser like ideal connection ,  hemus and event business management .
 then they will mark out and lease out the unit .
 similar to what we saw at serangoon interchange ,  hougang interchange ,  angmo kio interchange and etc .
 mostly lease to middle man business ,  mark up the rent then lease out again .
 so smrt will get the rental no matter if the unit is occupied or vacant .
 then as for event organisers ,  if cannot find long term like malay kueh ,  handphone shop ,  prepack food to lease the shop ,  they will rent weekly to insurance ,  bank ,  electricity company to do  &apos;roadshow &apos; for them to tout customers charging them $350 - $650 per day for a week .
 as expected an ex army general ceo ,  running businesses to the ground .
 why singapore business naming all .
 like to play with x think very cool ?
 it’s very 90s loh !
 that place is decent traffic since it &apos;s on the way to cathay ,  last time went there to eat ,  got free flow ice cream .
 woo ricebox was good .
 but now closed liao .
 the concept was great actually ,  using leftover space beside the mrt for retail .
 but the wayfinding is **** ,  so hard to go in and out ,  and the interior is so dull and dated .
 sometimes they dont even have aircon in the deeper shops .
 total failure la .
 too stingy to find a retail expert to look at it first so thats what u pay lor .
 cos they &apos;re made by gen x .

 rendered it  &apos;useless &apos; to me to even continue to use  it 
 it was bought 12 yrs ago    .
 i bought a new one at bhg recently too .
 after discounts around 30+ iirc .
 original price was 50+ .
 mine lasted for 12yrs and going strong .
 but it &apos;s not a full wallet .
 more like cardholder but it has enough space and size to put cash .
 bought a new piece recently cos this model is very hard to find ,  even other brands dont have .
 so buy and standby first just in case .

 yes buddy ,  all provided to lawyer and police liao .
 unfortunately police say no case .
 now waiting acra to advice .
 the transfer part sounds fishy if u were oredi made a shareholder .
 did u oso grant him some other poa ?
 3 mths after we trf the shares via corp sec .
 he yrf everything back to himself via his corp pass without our approval .
 and mata says this ain’t a criminal case ,  but a civil one ?
 if say never make comment ,  means never make unless can prove he make the comment .
 i think he might have forgotten or something .
 it sounds like him .
 to prove it definitively ,  we need sound engineers or some technical experts who can conduct voice forensic analysis to prove that it &apos;s really him or not .
 i still think it &apos;s him .
 i really salute people when everything is so obvious liao but they have the gut to deny .
 i think is from wp .
 r we able to do anything abt it ?
 hmm if he dare liddat say i don’t think he’s lying leh .
 could be someone else then  ?
 replying on fb comment seems to be a good way to clear his own name
 means its all said by vivian ?
 can vivian please clear this up .
 otherwise means his a even bigger ass 
 salute them lor .
 he like not oni losing his hair but oso eyebrow slowly bo liao .
 damn stress sia
 i find it difficult to believe that vb made those comments himself .
 the voice sounds different .
 i still think lw made the comments .
 anyways ,  this requires technical experts from edmw to prove it conclusively with some voice software or something .
 seems like him     .
 honest mistake move on
 time for edmw csi to get to work and produce the proof
 told u that house is haunted .
 the way “lousy” is pronounced is a dead give-away .
  it’s lw; hear enough of his speeches and chiu know .
 initially it was just elitism .
  now it’s oso an integrity problem .
 if not him then who ?
 no one has got the integrity to own up .
 yeah i oso agree with chiu .
  he looked when he heard it .
 title say raised voice .
 inside post hum chee ask what will happen .
 i dont usually give dispute resolution advice on the internet but my 2 cents: .
 write a note  &apos;meet me at tiong bahru plaza for trial by combat &apos; then leave your telegram/whatsapp/signal to confirm timing .
 oso for a small fee or a buffet treat i can be the objective 3rd party referee ^^
 kan him back shout at him loud loud like ballsy gangster

 ceca snake deadlier than venomous snake .
 the man has become double-headed snake now .
 why kill own kind ?
 so it &apos;s not a myth .
 if chiu see a cobra and a ceca .
 kill the ceca first
 the story of killing ceca over cobra is true !
 rip to the snake .
 if 1 ceca and 100 cobras ,  in a room .
 who will chiu kill first ?
 for me ,  cecs first .
 n release 100 cobras to the wild .
 they are the real many headed snakes  
 i had a very bad experience with c guy .
 till now ,  still very angry whenever mentioned about c guy .
 actually they are not worth comparing to snakes .
 snakes are thousand times better than them .
 i know they eat snake but this is … .
 like to see him do that when a mosquito bites him
 i still remember joo chiat tips like $20 oni .

 what happen to the hamsters ?
 give him the maximum five years and s$10 , 000 fine .
 just too bad cant cane him otherwise cane him as well for this scum to learn .
 i stay in landed but dont keep pets anymore
 23 yrs can go geylang .
 if it still existed !
 pity the girl ,  at least she &apos;s logical enough to say no to sex
 certified siao lang .
 got gf still wanna hug underage xmm who isnt even interested in him .
 and all the lame excuses he gave is really fvcking lame ttm .
 what &apos;s wrong with the youngster these days ?
 if i’m the judge will sentence this guy full max penalty  .
 use cute hamsters to lure xmm to lay his tiko thoughts on her is worst then a beast  .
 hope his daughter next time kena sex predator karma from his actions
 breeding and selling hamsters now !
 why all these sex offenders so many csb .
 keep their little bro in check everything safe oredi ,  stupiak .
 but xmm oso lucky never kena penetrate ,  otherwise really traumatized for life
 moral of alot of similar cases : parents better follow kids along ,  as long as it is anywhere outside of classes .
 but kids these days oso hard to control .
 should charge the hamsters too
 lost balance then ended up on top of the girl ?
 what nonsense is this ?
 that is a different hamster that he is selling .
 many sex predators out there .
 girls need to be taught more on self protection from young
 this kind should rotan .
 bt girl must oso be more firm and say no the first time la .
 the pervert get wrong signals .
 he prob think he score liao .
 aiya never let us play game
  &apos;you know how come i have so many hamsters ?
 let me show chiu .
 the gf how he is
 i feel there’s alot of reluctant talking and acting between the 3 spider-man .
 i feel like a small immature kid who wants everyone to forget who he is so he can get to a desired university .
 and then end up losing his aunt and his best friend and gf both forgotten him .
 it is a sad ending story that makes me feel like my 2 hour wasted .
 doing stupid thing and end up losing everything .
 to make this movie better ,  there should be a twist behind that wang came back and help him change back to the day that he first visit him .
 it should be a better ending that way .
 finally wang bring them go ktv sing hotel california .
 new hobby in shangchi .
 what do u think ?
 worth the $ to watch ?
 i recommend watch at home .
 movie targeted at kids .
 very immature stupid mistakes inside .
 the aunts purpose was to server water or saltwater ,  no help at all and she died
 its all about opening the multiverse for more opportunities to milk your money .
 who cares about the plot ?
 wang as in wang leehom ?
 yes ,  return the s$2 , 400+ jobs to sinkies first ,  keep the s$66k jobs to ramesh .
 at first i thought this was an ad and just scrolled past 
 yesterday oredi say he will come out on this liao when shan ge called for debate 
 satki lim tean  .
 shanmugum and team dare to accept lim tean challenge boh ?
 i would pay money to witness such a spectacle .
 this pap argh so defensive about this treaty .
 protect them macam like protect their overlord .
 when pap is defensive means they got something to hide
 can mediacorp schedule a pay per view event if shanmugum accepts lim tean to debate on live tv ?
 i willingly will pay $10 to watch
 ok go help psp now
 i believe there is something incriminating that india has over singapore .
 this kind of extreme politics will oni attract the extreme oppies .
 very hard to gain any real ground
 lol lets see 3 wood root dare to accept the challenge anot haha
 likely our political leaders
 nazism and fascism was raising in germany before wwii cos masses in germany was suffering due to the great depression
 deep fakes nowadays very good sia !
 solid deep fakes !
 saw some tutorial using nvidia g-cards to do these deep fakes ,  notch simple ,  need solid processing power
 wa deep fake dip dip
 wa in a way look like ltk sia .
 its very troubling that this can be done so well .
 how to distinguish fact from fiction ?
 deepfake really no horse run nao
 i made these gifs .
 iceberg got kena lim kopi ?
 sooner later edmw will get banned
 we want to see jt and dowager .
 knn edmw realli welly tarented    
 wa u golem beatdown deck replacement ?
 yup is sexpensive  .
 why they put burger on table ?
 french food and a rando burger is weird sia .
 who came up with the menu
 ts not in sinkieland 
 ordered an extra burger
 i is in sinkieland
 that menu got me distracted & misread .
 thot u &apos;re in france 
 looks civil to moi .
 ts this is the best idea .
 that cheater will come back and repay chiu .
 works 100% of the time .
 if he can do this to chiu .
 do this back to him .
 no need to show mercy .
 he cheated chiu ,  now do what chiu should do .
 sexpose him online .
 but ask lawyer whether that will complicate matters .
 if it dose &apos;t then post big big !
 report to wanbao and mothershit !
 let the whole sinkieland know
 i am more disappoint with the various agencies on their response and advice .
 will think abt wjat u said .
 nobody deserves to get cheated
 yes buddy ,  we have the acra printout of the subsequent change by him and it &apos;s indicated made by him .
 this subsequent change is without any sipporting documents or agreements between share holders .
 the puzzling point is that the police do not see that a crime is committed .
 and acra is not responding .
 what other agencies should i be approaching ?
 i wanted to talked to commercial affairs but they told me to lodge a police report and was assigned an io .
 obviously the io do not find any problem with the investigation .
 the moment he refused your first request for bank signatory oredi can kick him out ?
 how many % chiu own ?
 wow then its a management decision to let him retain signatory i gues ?
 tbh edmw cant help much ,  this is a costly thing to rectify 
 are u even sure u can recover anything ?
 the company got anything to liquidate ?
  what if the original owner show u accounts that they have been making losses all these while and your investment oredi wiped out ?
 just did a insolvency search and he is bankrupt .
 getting anything seems doubtful .
 but my shareholders wants to see justice done .
 we may try to pursue the criminal aspect .
 it not our decision to retain .
 he refuse to add our names in as signatories after we added our names .
 really angry to feed scammers  .
 hope u and shareholders can get closure .
 lesson in life: never believe anyone(other than close family) no matter how nice or sincere they sound .
 i got bitten multiple times and have basically lost faith in humans
 in after revert back
 i find it hard to believe acra didnt inform ts .
 usually got email informing the directors .
 isnt this cause to terminate him on the spot ?
 is he a shareholder ?
 what prevented chiu from getting rid of him then
 chiu earn 5k per month but your wife smelly smelly $10k+ per month .
 liddat life very tough leh
 me reporting in
 i will sug my wife &apos;s kukujiao
 chiu guys really ought to be shot !

 i just look at thread title haven’t click ,  oredi expecting to see xhamster references  .
 so fast 2nd post oredi tio  edmw doesn’t disappoint 
 why sho many loser sinkies like to rape underage girls .
 paedophilia is dangerous .

 he &apos;s trying to touch another persons hamster
 shan challenges leong to a ceca debate and leong gamely accepts the challenge despite being up against a formidable minister .
 will shan accept lim tean’s challenge on a tv ceca debate ?
 they gotta revamp their image man .
 u dont get 4 people sit in front of the telly ,  keep quiet and 1 person talk .
 why should 3 wood root accept a  &apos;challenge &apos; from a nobody who is ranting in fb ?
 anyway what he says ,  sinkies oso dont like ,  cos sinkies find him too aggressive .
 then just wait patiently for wp to raise the ceca issue lor .
 we all have time .
 hope he join forces with leong to help him with the debate .
 but he and csj should learn how to keep their cool and debate calmly .
 it is true ,  sinkies in general find him too aggressive .
 talk so much for what ,  he should help leong with preparations .
 oni mps are allowed to debate in parliament .
 can’t allow any tom dick harry to ask for debate .
 can’t just write fb posts on this and act as a leader .
 dont be surprised .
 when phv drivers and food and parcel riders say  .
 who wants a $2 , 400 job when i can earn $4 , 000 easily by being my own boss .
 debates can be held in a public space as well .
  there’s no rule that restricts them within the confines of a parliamentary assembly .
 if shamugan and other pap ministers thinks ceca is a very good deal ,  they should come out and debate outside parliament
 want to debate why must go parliament to debate  ?
 just open a facebook group or facebook page to open debate .
 let all join in
 that is a wrong approach .
 cos then anyone can ask for debate on any topic and ministers will have to oblige to debate them in public .
 who is lim tean to even ask for a debate ?
 he is just a private citizen like anybody else .
 just by giving speeches ,  posting on youtube and facebook doesn’t give him any right to ask for debates .
 it is the correct approach if the topic of debate is of national importance .
  and it’s not about lim tean requesting .
 lim tean is really my new favourite politician now .
 my neighbour &apos;s black dog very humji one ,  oni dare to barks at the weak and old .
 saw big sized guy ,  diam diam hide one corner .
 dont dare one la .
 will sure come up with some stupid excuse that he is not qualified la ,  he cannot represent citizens la ,  all that crap la .
 chiu know the drill .
 they are bullies .
 would be good to have miw vs dr thum ,  lim tean and of cos the person who was challenged lmw
 ah gui lai liaooo 
 but it &apos;s always been dead what .
 even the one at dhoby gaut damn dead except for the korean eatery and bakery shop
 no wonder so happy ,  so much space for chiu to play with 
 i have never been there before .
 is smrt a rail operator or property company ?
 while smrt is sufffering with its low retail space take-up ,  hong kong mrt is booming like crazy !
 shops here are doing better and better .
 if any of chiu guys been to the central mtr station ,  it is like a mini city down there .
 above it is the ifc mall .
 retail in hong kong has bounced back .
 good times ahead here !
 cos many dont even know it exists .
 my wife works nearby .
 i went with my wife before
 rent to ghost for events
 can catch spirits and bring there too 
 don’t stress that smrt gm .
 probably he doesn’t know what to do oso since board will say no to anything that cost money ,  especially now smrt is privatised and own by temasak .
 it will be near impossible to pull in an anchor tenant since retail is at its worst since covid .
 anchor operator would rather choose to go into the mall which is keen to provide an attract rental since they will need to substantially fit the store .
 that is why when interview ,  he says he is talking to prospective tenants but there could be none actually .
 if open don don donki maybe will huat ?
 place is a bad fengsui .
 lots of pillar with zizag pathway with broken qi .
 destinated to doom from start .
 who is that man on the  .
 why post this pic .
 in this thread ?
 “we have been trying to ask smrt to give us some assistance ,  but the assistance that they gave us ,  in the form of some rental rebate ,  is actually not enough to cover (our operation costs) at all , ” said one tenant who runs a food and beverage outlet ,  and was given a 20 to 30 per cent rebate .
 selling oni 30 boxes priced at s$6 a day ,  she said it is nearly impossible for her to cover rental and overheads each month .
 “how can we cope ?
 i almost want to commit suicide already… i don’t really know how to move forward , ” she said .
 smrt has proven themselves to be blood suckers
 remember to thank lw for insisting that indians from india must be allowed to fly into singapore .
 the obvious happened and virus infections spiked .
 then they impose ha phase 2 .
 30 boxes of what ?
 ghost town still got 30 .
 transactions during p2ha !
 top management by who .
 always focus on getting more bonus .
 too bad the tenant got no choice .
 all taken by same group of management .
 things that 100% can earn .
 same group of people will be taking over .
 thats the reason why no improvement but price increase .
 thats why always shoot the  .
 bro ,  the mosquito must be blind or eye got stamp .
 wow ,   even a snake oso cant tolerate them .
 so the joke about indian n snake make sense after all
 they swim in granges river and exalt cow biowaste .
 venom has nearly no effect .
 ownself jiak ownself
 the snake dammed rucky neber kena turned into a tenga by the other  &apos;relative &apos; .
 the snake should know its place and not bite a bigger snake .
 really is never die before .
 i had my fair share of experiences .
 other people without direct experience wont understand one ,  they oni know how to talk c0ck say we xenophobic/racist .
 i was under very immerse stress mentally .
 even until now .
 being smoking alot too due to stress .
 it’s a snake eat snake world over there
 classic snake bite snake !
 it takes a snake to know another .
 see la ,  the snake oso know ceca die first .
 not to mention we pick one of them to die first .
 makes perfect sense what .
 means ceca is more dangerous than snakes .
 bitten by a krait is no joking matter lei .
 can be fatal deh whorx .
 hope he survive .
 harnorhh mmm sii lw larr is gui .
 insai da parliman huuuuhuuuuuuuuhuuuuuuuuu .
 ok i listened to the amped audio without the video .
 i conclude that vb made the comments ,  not lw .
 i retract my previous statements and apologize to lw .
 the video is quite distracting ,  we would think lw made the comments just cos his head was turning ,  but actually ,  listening to the audio without the video ,  and with amped volume ,  i trust that vb was the one who made the comments .
 my apologies to the gentleman once again .
 maybe he deny so that next time this wont come back to bite him in the future if he become pm .
 the place is haunted… knn macham ghost story now caught on tape/ mic
 zhun bo ,  it really sounded like him .
 but since there’s no proof unless got voice recognition experts to disprove it ,  we oso have to accept his denial .
 can he say ”must be lousy school” again ,  i want hear it ,  funny leh .
 ”whoever” said that just own up la ,  pap minister cannot handle new age pr .
 look at najib ,  teflon .
 lying is worse than making an undesirable comment
 if is he say ,  then tai ji liao liao .
 can someone ask vivian to confirm he oso said lousy school ?
  &apos;every school is good school &apos; .
 who &apos;s from monk &apos;s hill then ?
 seems lw still want the pm post .
 i keep replaying the video ,  and still find  &apos;lousy school &apos; the voice and tone different from vb early parts .
 unless cos he turned his head away and affected the frequency or something
 i suspect vb will be the fall guy for lw so as not to tarnish lw for pm .
 i wont be surprised as vb is a cxxk sxxker to those above him .
 i hear 3 different voices .
 aiya both by vb .
 no need speculate speculate ar ,  maybe alien .
 dont look at video ,  and dont consider previous sentences (because someone can change their pitch when they start a new sentence) .
 go to previous post with sound clip from vocaroo and keep replaying the clip from 8 second to 11 second .
 just listen to that  &apos;must have been a lousy school &apos; sentence .
 whose voice is that  ?
 wow double down on his lies .
 didnt know vivian can imitate lawrence wong 100% .
 so talented vb .
 lawrence i lost all my respect for chiu .
 chiu were my choice for pm .
 until chiu lost your balls .
 oppies still stirring this .
 minister vb comments oso nothing wrong in first place

 love to give away green hats .
 just look at the amount of hermes and whatever fug they buy  .
 should see them take photo of their land title deeds back in vn .

 sugar drink give high feeling

 sorry to hear ts needed comcare but did not get it .
 isit cos chiu single bbfa ?
 the lady in question got 4 kids to raise ,  probably thats why easier to get comcare

 if u r really in need go see yr mp or grassroots advisor and tell them yr sob story .

 my fren keep brewing money until 20 30 k .
 keep rolling over friends
 poor people sometimes have tunnel vision .
 they need help to get out of thr tunnel vision .
 thats why must go ktv ,  to make new friends
 thats why poor people cannot give money one .

 better to provide free education or meals (food they may sell for money and gamble it away)

 please sic code thanks !
 where is @sticky
 how come look like hebe ?
 i think is photoshopped the face
 how comes now u the one posting kym threads .
 but good effort
 chio bu spotted   .
 he was seeking funding for his operations .
 he did not let us know the full extend of his personal liabilities .
 his personal liability is actually more than 1/2 mil outside .
 when we invested he showed that he used the funds to buy raw material etc etc .
 little do we know suddenly all just stop ops .
 we do not want to very micromangaing him ,  but the signatory issue was never resolved .
 sorry for your issue bro ,  cant help chiu ,  but it seems the guy knew what he was doing when he took your money .
 thank chiu all anyway
 this i will have to wait for acra to revert liao
 for the share transfer back to md ,  it seems ts have to show proof to the police and acra that this was not authorised .
 your lawyer should oso highlight this .
  without that ,  dont think the police or acra can do much .
 ts say the md is a bankrupt ?
 he should be disqualified to be director .
 was he the oni director before chiu joined ?
 ts hold 51% shares in the company now ?
 it is possible to get back control of the company ,  if chiu still want it .
 please hire another secretary agent or use your current lawyer to get this done .
 and yeh ,  can sue him for the money ,  but unlikely you &apos;ll get back anything soon since the md is a bankrupt .
 it will be good to have a shareholder agreement done up and oso do dd searches through a lawyer before investing in a business/company .
 in the first place ,  why would this ssmc commit a $3m po to this company if the company is not financially capable on fulfilling the order ?
 never do basic vendor due diligence ?
 ssmc issued an open po to the company .
 the working model is that we send in goods to ssmc on consignment .
 ssmc then will used the materoal and we will bill on a monthly basis based on stock drawn down .
 the md over projected his sales figure .
 reaching on 20 to 30k per month instead of at least 100k .
 but we do not understand how the company suddenly ceased operations oso .
 he was not contactable since feb 2020
 roughly need 50k to get back your 200k .
 but if counterparty no money ,  your 50k will be poorly spent .
 usually this kind ,  people will still sue .
 have seen people spend more than what theyre owed just to spite the other party .
 tq buddy ,  our investment is over 1/4 mil .
 aimming to sue for 1/4 mil at state court .
 minus 50k legal .
 hoping to get back 200k .
 as i just said earlier ,  he decalre bankrupt liao .
 so chances are low
 aiya no need to worry .
 cbt is a very powerful charge .
 once reported and proven guilty ,  chiu then proceed civil suit .
 now find lawyer oso no use .
 fight until the end ,  lawyer oso cannot guarantee chiu money can take back immediately .
 but lawyer fee u confirm must give .
 posted with aos is my favourite hardwarezone forums app
 if chiu need good lawyer ,  let me know .
 if he has a po of $3mil from a reputable company liddat ,  the bank sme loan section would be more than willing to loan him that measly $250k .
 sounds premeditated to con
 didnt read the 8 pages .
 md and corp sec same person oredi an alarm bell .
 corp sec should be independent .
 corp sec needs to draft and sight the signed director &apos;s resolution that says chiu agree or resign from your position as director of the company .
 then the share transfer can take effect be it via sales of share to be distributed as shareholder loan or paid in cash by the md to buy outright .
 check if the company has been strike out or did the md hire auditor to wind down company .
 likely it is strike out as its cheaper .
 strike out companies can reopen case where fraud is involved .
 if ts got a copy of that po then should verify with ssmc .
 3 million usually need tender one .
 unlikely will be issue to small vendor .
 just read this .
 your chances are nil .
 now it &apos;s whether chiu want to spend more money and put him in jail for fraud .
 this type no backing no money no other support cannot do huan .
 no wonder bo lui .
 he &apos;s gutsy and glad he is around in politics  but wish him to be more objective .
 rather he add firepower than claim credit .
 can faster fix him can or not  ?
 if they really put down their faces ,  pride ,  power hungry mentality ,  they should form a coalition and force a good debate .
 currently bills passed has zero chance of being checked or refused one .
 damn one sided .
 wait till senior position in banking ,  it or any others sectors dominated by ceca national .
 by then is not issue anymore lor .
 he is another csj in the making .
 sinkies dont like confrontational politics
 just wait for wp to raise the issue .
 why stop there ?
 should open debate to edmwers too .
 wa liddat oso can ah 
 chiu new to singapore ?
 its been liddat for umpteen years .

 a doctor in a gahment hospital in madhya pradesh resigned on saturday after some congress leaders ,  including former minister pc sharma ,  allegedly misbehaved with him following the death of a patient .
 while mp chief minister shivraj singh chouhan appealed to people to boost the morale of doctors instead of demoralising them ,  mr sharma claimed he did not speak rudely to the doctor and was oni involved since the patient was a member of his assembly constituency .
  &apos;our senior doctor yogendra shrivastava has resigned after some politicians misbehaved with him .
 a patient in a critical condition was admitted to the trauma ward this morning .
 dr yogendra told his family his condition was too critical .
 during treatment he died ,  following which some politicians misbehaved with the doctor ,  &apos; gahment jp hospital civil surgeon dr rakesh shrivastava told pti .
 a video of the incident ,  which went viral on social media ,  showed mr sharma and former congress corporator yogendra chouhan purportedly shouting at dr yogendra shrivastava .
 cm chouhan tweeted ,   &apos;saddened by the incident ,  a senior doctor has resigned .
 we live in a civilised society and right now it is the time to stand together .
 creating furore was neither in public good nor right in the fight against covid .
 when contacted ,  mr sharma said ,   &apos;the doctor did not talk to me in the morning when the family of the critical patient was trying to get him to talk to me over the phone .
 instead ,  the doctor told them to take the patient to a private hospital .
 snake eat snake world out there .
 the sad thing is he got humiliated for doing the right thing .
 sometimes i am ashamed of my own species
 it isn’t the doctor fault .
 it is the gahment failure for not being prepared for the pandemic .
 they are too corrupted and not building more facilities and engage more doctors with budget but rather pushing the blame to the doctors and nurses .
 there are more patients than what the hospital can cope .
 just pull the mask off the guy shouting at him with expletives .
 when politician cant solve problem ,  chiu just push or arrow .
 i think for singapore it should be fine to open its border to accept the people over to here for treatment .
 cause no point since india medical facilities are breaking down .
 singapore could extend medical support and earn revenue instead and increase humanitarian image .
 probably resign to save himself .
 imagine doctors working 18 hours a day now
 he can cum here cont his practice  ,  for sure our pappy will love him  .
 oso ,  here no blame culture  .
 gotch any people die due to cobid ,  its cos of our own complacency and fault for notch listening to gahmen and @ssperts  .
 even die after jab ,  oso will say notch related to jab  .
 so ,  he will be safe and protected here  .
 on a separate note ,    .
  &apos;a doctor in a gahment hospital in madhya pradesh resigned on saturday after some congress leaders ,  including former minister pc sharma ,  allegedly misbehaved with him &apos;  .
 i was wondering why the doctor had to resign just cos he was naughty together with the politicians .
 anyway ,  the doctor quite poor thing too .
 he should cum here !
 cecapore welcums him with no blame culture and let &apos;s move on !
 kope-ship can kope .

 got cut kukujiao skin .
 know of someone who has been renting from smrt for almost over a decade .
 covid hit last year and smrt still insisted on 20% increase in rental during lockdown period .
 (fyi rental amount is in 5 digits so 20% is quite a lot) .
 llst let the shop go .
 was empty for about half a year before they got some other tenant in .
 make into bubbletea town
 that’s one raffles place .
 basement got four bubble tea stalls
 how come hong kong tw korea jippun mrt retail doing well .
 worst case just change to massage parlour .
 every station can relax
 oni popeyes can survive there
 mcdonald’s can ,  pizza hard…
 if no big brand anchor there ,  all the small brands lose to shopee oredi .
 would have closed sooner or later
 which big brand want to open at a place known as ghost town ?
 lol ,  pap keep building shiny malls like what era oredi ,  and pump up reits but cnt capitalise on e-commerce
 see la try to copy japan train station + retail/f&b concept .
 copy good idea ,  but **** execution  
 linked to ion oso manage until kenasai ,  really is full of s*** mgmt
 building a mall before a row of sbopping malls is a great idea
 japan got rental caps for such establishments ?
 these shops are nothing new and not a novelty ,  every train stations in other countries has them .
 but the paper general who took over does not seem to know how to help these shops and businesses prosper .
 he just dont bother and leave them to their own devices  .
 very sad ,  it &apos;s pathetic
 pap is a big failure under ah loong .
 someone &apos;s vision lol ,  using mrt stations to milk sales ,  they think macam like the jap subway train stations where shops are being located .
 ironically it &apos;s warrants a fine if u eat and drink in the mrt  .
 yet most tenants are fnb
 it &apos;s above orchard mrt and linked to taka .
 before covid from taka can just walk over .
 now barricaded and can oni enter by going up the escalator from orchard mrt .
 nong nong time ago got popular there .
 she looks younger than fann 
 i want to merry her
 she sell vegetarian food at circuit road .
 her husband orange juice stick got how many diplomas ?
 well done xiang yun .
 she is almost the ideal wife .
 she is preparing for the day that her company undercut her for the contract extension or decide to cut her loose .
 her screen appearance decreased alot since 2019 .
 maybe the station may not want her any more .
 that is xie shaoguang
 she oredi earn alot and nearing retirement age .
 im sure she &apos;s fine .
 her family has a stall there last time
 aging gracefully vs being dragged kicking and screaming
 that one is a monk .
 her children can take care of her
 diploma in acting ?
 women that looked acceptable when older are those that spend time and money to zhng .
 how old is she ?
 she looks so much better than the z & f .
 what &apos;s stall name and address ?
 but she does not man the stall personally right ?
 seems like my hearing is failing me .
 if he really lied ,  everyone in the conversation would know .
 next if chiu see someone promoted if he were to become pm .
 sorry some of our ears here works better than the useless taskforce .
 he lied blatantly .
 da nasal voice jiin dangz leii…………… .
 i could winner this post a million times .
 i think between them vb oredi agreed to front for all .
 no point they sacrifice 2 right ?
 well well well .
 then who could have it been .
 need edmwer with voice analysis software to sexpose lw and disgrace him for good .
 tsl just said he &apos;s from monk &apos;s hill .
 nothing bad about that .
 so many of us have been hearing his voice for so many fridays for two years oredi .
 the  &apos;lousy &apos; word is an 1000000% dead giveaway .
 i lost all respect for this liar .
 oyk how clueless he may be ,  i take that over lw intergity issue .
 i mean if chiu oredi made up your mind that it’s lw no matter what ,  then it doesn’t matter what they say .
 cause as long it doesn’t match your conclusion ,  it’s fake news
 i though they should be whiter than white ?
 most likely vb was told not to say it &apos;s whom ,  same goes for tsl .
 so vb is taking the fall for him
 lol ,  why chiu so worked up .
 i didnt say yours fake news .
 and it &apos;s not i made up my mind .
 im just pointing out possible alternative .
 if chiu cant take others with different opinions then chiu shouldn &apos;t be participating in a forum .
 huai people fwighting isit da liang popo anotch harr ?
 if conzfirmz is liang popo ,  will lose job ?
 if notch liang popo ,  then will gotch new people kee chiu ownself admit sibohh !
 oso bohh conclusionz huanz larr………… .
 knn yee gong yee tio !
 no blame culture please
 the other thing we need to consider is personality ,  who is more likely to utter those words .
 lw is more careful and conservative type .
 vb is the  &apos;commentator &apos; type ,  he likes to comment .
 he oso said about wanting to eat at hawker centre or restaurant .
 this is his personality .
 meanwhile lw did not ever make such comments .
 so i think the sentence  &apos;must have been a lousy school &apos; is more consistent with vb personality and vb previous sentence .
 it &apos;s more likely to come out from vb .
 quarantine for what  ?
 and how to quarantine  ?
 by checking through all his handphone ,  social media ,  email ,  blogs ,  etc to check whether he ever engage in any anti-ccp activities .
 and whether any of his friends ,  families ,  associates are in the black list .
 if confirmed ,  can send him to xj re-education camp to further quarantine .
 quarantine for tiong people .
 for all the ignorant ones ,  from sept all international travellers to cheena must enter via guangzhou and be quarantined centrally .
 those going to cheena lip lai .
 how much u think international travellers got to pay ?
 got pictures of her feet ?
 im curious to see how her toes look like .
 camping here ,  will up your points !
 this type usually braless at home  and wont hesitate to press her boobs against her brothers or dad .
   very open minded .
 she turned les .
 face looks photoshopped
 looks better than @iamnobodyxxx
 first time u sic a good pic .
 jeanette aw and paige chua still ok la .
 have angmo bf cant be too airport kind  .
 still need to have curves
 lousy means lousy
 why most of the safe entry staff ive seen are mostly aunties and bbfa uncles ?
 paige chua shoulder meaty kind so to me not airport  .
 jeanette aw has slight bumps for boobs and big ass so  for me they r figure is not bad
 more like shuqi .
 3 mil he claim .
 it was an open po for 3 yrs ,  3 mil was based on the consumption of the plant .
 they bidded for this po before we got involve .
 after securing this order ,  then the md came to me .
 the po is legit ,  we were supplying to ssmc for a few months ,  but at a much smaller quantum than projected .
 chiu sure ssmc allow blanket po for 3 years ?
 that is strange for a big company .
 they offered a 3 year cost down pricing scheme and they got a 3 yrs p .
 this one not cbt ?
 corp sec and md not same entity .
 md changed shareholding unilaterally using corp pass .
 tmd acra website facing tech issue ,  cannot extract info*
 tq buddy ,  he bankrupt liao .
 need to talk to share holder abt course of action .
 ts so what is the status ?
 what is the next course of action that chiu can take against him .
 most importantly can chiu expose him online ?
 the other share holder not free today .
 tomolo will meet up and talk .
 likely we cant get anything out of the md liao .
 it &apos;s obvious cbt liao .
 dunno isit acra see him bankrupt liao dont want to charge him .
 as mentioned ,  if there are no implications for exposing the cheater online after consulting lawyer .
 then chiu can report this on facebook ,  to wan bao ,  xin ming ,  mothership ,  158 and even edmw .
 i mean that cheater cannot hide corporate veil ,  do such things and not get caught .
 have to expose him otherwise others will do the same .
 then magically things will be solved somehow
 the israeli human resources professional packed her bags for new york with her husband and children this month .
 lol good luck finding job in ny

 inter coy transfer over
 ft come sinkieland .
 sian of  &apos;stressful lifestyle &apos; here ,  still can go back country side live .
 cb sinkies forever stuck here .
 singapore attracts mercenaries .
 this is what i called them ftrashes n ctrashes  .
 both come here desperately to work .
 both desperately want to get out of spore .
 remind me when i go for ict to defend this kind of humans
 expats will come and go .
 it &apos;s a pity mtf xenophobic policies have made them felt unwelcome .
 u have a choice
 good continue the empty promises given to the people many ft will see it themselves .
 they will never lift the restrictions no matter how many jabs u take .
 we are not talking abt the merry go round from 2-5-8 pax game  .
 we are talking about letting the people to lead a normal life and not check in when u need to go buy groceries in supermarket .
 and how is it sinkies fault again ?
 pak cham still need wear mask  .
 endemic still wear mask ?
 these are the fairweather expats who cannot take a bit of hardship .
 we dunnid such weaklings .
 they can fug off .
 that’s why it’s empty promises again .
 sinkies are crazy to believe the promises again and again when none of it is being given .
 yah fark off and dont come back .
 angmo or south asia ?
 even sinkies oso leeches la .
 just that many of us want to run oso nowhere to run
 1 go out 3 come in
 people say outside food all unhealthy try to cook at home .
 but cooking jin tiring .
 is fish soup healthy ?
 my friend said many msg
 i find kfc healthier
 chiu never know what goes inside the big cooking pot of soup .
 buy raw fish ,  buy boiling water from drinks stall .
 cook the raw fish with the boiling water .
 sure healthy ,  no msg or added flavour .
 taste the natural freshness of the fish cooked to middle well done .
 just fish plus water .
 i tried to cook fish soup at home .
 with tofu n spinach .
 add a bit of salt .
 2021 liao still got people believe the msg hoax ?
 u find the soup tasty and your mum cooking not tasty ?
 gxgx tasty food usually is unhealthy and your mum cooking is healthy thats why it tastes healthy
 it &apos;s usually the soup stock that may be unhealthy .
 depends on how the hawker prepare the stock .
 some stalls i know take hours to boil the soup and they use chicken ,  pork bones ,  fish bones ,  beans ,  onions ,  garlic etc .
  minimum salt and no msg .
 some stalls take the short cut and just use rice water with some chicken bones ,  and a tonne of msg ,  salt and fish sauce .
 if chiu think the soup has alot of msg ,  just skip the soup .
 unless they say they no put msg ,  usually most outsai food got put .
 get those with spinach ones .
 chiu want healthy ,  chiu want to hiam no taste .
 got taste ,  means flavour gao gao .
 flavour gao gao means ,  simisai oso put inside .
 then chiu dont think healthy anot lor .
 i ever talk to a friend doc .
 most of fish soup is full of msg .
 sodium and salt .
 it is infact very unhealthy .
 tell me to eat ok .
 but avoid drinking too much soup
 can do pepsi bljnd test .
 one outside hawker .
 one ownself cook with msg .
 one ownself cook without msg .
 then can really tok
 i think more like when the soup left over alot so they add water and add msg to top up so the soup is like cook long long liao then got the full flavour .
 the  &apos;take hours to boil the soup and they use chicken ,  pork bones ,  fish bones ,  beans ,  onions ,  garlic etc .
  &apos; sound like wife cook for family then will use the effort to slowly boil the soup into flavour .
 i usually skip ramen soup .
 u should benchmark the taste of your mum &apos;s cooking for healthiness if u r unsure .
 or u can refer to hospital food
 nowadays singapore diners very smart one  .
 once they detect the high level of msg and sodium  .
 they will siam the stall forever ,  unless they enjoy and dont mind the artificial flavouring .
 thats why some fish soup stalls are more popular than others ,  and usually it &apos;s the food quality that attracts the long queues .
 i think the oni food thats truly healthy if u eat out is salad with no dressing .
 fish soup not necessarily more healthy bec its lower in oil but there are fried fish soup oso many fishes used actually are high in mercury .
 soup stock wise oso alot use too much msg .
 just average only
 bedok food centre ?
 i tried before .
 tiagong amk that one better
 oredi comes w/ egg & begedil: $2 .
 too famous in the past but actually oni normal
 aussie there have anot ?
 have asian food but cannot compare the taste like that
 any stalls that are not the sweet kind ?
 this one no where near the best .
 those power ones got an old school taste ,  i cant describe but very hard to find these days .
 dunno how to apprrciate .
 more of mee soto guy
 i absolutely disagree .
 the best one should be this one .
 this guy pwn everyone  !
 oni good about inspirasi is cheap .
 dont fancy the taste .
 one of their neighbours lagi worse .
 oni belachan and haebi taste .
 maybe is another style ?
 nowadays quite hard to find a mee rebus with thick peanut sauce + tau cheo .
 can try inspirasi neighbour .
 cant remember exact store .
 pretty salty ,  haebi + belachan taste .
 one dimensional to me .

 the ending meetup for what .
 during my time when i first log into edmw without a nick ,  it was epic .
 i think back in 2005 towards 2010 has alot of saga n very entertaining in here .
 most memorable saga was matchy and ce_lau story .
 they got to one another in real life ,  thatntime got plenty of gathering in edmw one .
 then they got to know one another n start spendin time solo ,  then one day got dispute .
 cos matchy is a gambler  ,  like to bet to soccer  ,  thus oni have $10 budget per day .
 cannot spend more than that when dating ,  then ce_lau mm got angry and all .
 then matchy blame her for not stopping him from gambling .
 then one day apparently ,  ce_lau kena preggy by one of the edmwer here then dissapear liao .
 but matchy is still here .
 if chiu think ccb is chio ,  wait till chiu see gloria

 even before covid
 swensons used to be behind popeye .
 but after rental was raised ,  swensons pulled out
 1st day in singapore ?
 just rent out to don donki or make whole stretch f&b sure got business wan la .
 these days retail is mostly about f&b or services .
 most other retail stuff unless it &apos;s branded ,  people could just get online .
 yea don don donki .
 or they should have just put their ion hawkers &apos; street there .
 chiu see the don donki at novena mrt .
 park at one side corner .
 still got so many people .
 way before covid when forever 21 was still there ,  oredi bo simi lang liao
 its a place for maids to gather .
 first time hear where is this  ?
 edmw here won’t know this place one la ,  bbfa all ,  just stay home and pcc
 so many retails toh… .
 i think all shops in exchanges doing badly .
 see the dhoby one .
 oso a bit non existent
 they gahment has parachuted in too many inexperienced guys from mindef .
 this place always nice and quiet .
 the justasia always quite full in the past .
 too bad the layout is damn weird
 u guys move further down to suntec and marina sq will see even more ghost towns .
 dont knw how long these malls can tahan .
 singapore all along too dependent on ft and tourists liao to support mall businesses .
 there are a few .
 raffles place xchange .
 dobby ghaut xchange .
 but the shops are those chapalang accessories shop ,  food ,  etc .
 nothing really worth visiting for in the first place .
 very good for her
 some people further their studies for leisure .
 most do it for survival .
 58 this year liao .
 still looking really good ,  for a sinkie woman .
 maybe last time when she was young .
 i can recognise that stall if i past by .
 she go local uni sure kena fuck de
 just be spokesperson for some company lol ,  other jobs out dere sure cannot compete with the ft legion la .
 wa ,  means she must be some hot diva in her 20s-30s .
 seems like there &apos;s no photo of her younger days being displayed on the net 
 i am not sure whether she actually earning if her main income is from the tv station .
 i dunno about what side income she is doing like what her colleague ben is doing .
 if there is any ,  then it is good for her .
 her children are still young .
 it is uncertain that chen xi will make it in the station with so much competition .
 i understand that her gal is still studying .
 it is unknown whether she can do it or she will become what her dad did in chasing his passion all the time .
 who want fuck her ?
 she is not those hot looking type .
 typical greedy sinkie .
 alot of my friends oso took many course .
 cos subsidised by gahment .
 no need go out of the house .
 what a waste of money .
 not sure what value addedness are there
 what is her husband doing
 so has she switched career now after getting so many useless diplomas ?
 nus dont have any1 who likes this milf type ?
 the voice was so distinctly  .
 anyway got those voice matching software to identify the person who said that ?
 it &apos;s someone who &apos;s angling himself to be the next pm .
 it &apos;s about integrity and thats a very serious matter .
 need to get to the bottom of it .
 whitewash ib marching in with nonsensical reasoning liao .
 ownself talk ,  ownself reply ,  ownself reply monk &apos;s hill ?
 there are obviously 3 different voices .
 1st vb ,  2nd lw ,  3rd tsl
 you’ve never worked in society before .
 the most smiley ,  friendliest people out there are typically the most conniving .
  they just hide it very well to make chiu let your guard down .
  in the highest echelons of politics ,  even more so .
 the ones beside him and the one behind him are the likely ones .
 i thought a heard a particular minister &apos;s voice but he &apos;s a little too far away .
 the one behind vb is quite likely to be one of them ?
 behind vb is koh poh koon who was an ri boy and son of punggol
 lets assume lw lied .
 if its lky era .
 lw just dugged a grave for himself by putting it on the record .
 denying saying what he had said .
 anyway ,  i think pm lee knows the truth on who said that  &apos;lousy school &apos; comment .
 think he is too shrewd to say something liddat .
 moi believe too how he survive if he was actually the one who said it .
 miw will be the first to backstab him and downvote him no need all the who who sjw owl come jjww liao
 i think u r the v worked up one .
 he never say he cannot live with your comments too .
 wow the plot very similar to squid game episode 6 ,  every man for himself !
 if not him ,  then tell us who loh .
 he definitely heard it anyway since he was sitting in the middle of the conversation
 lol your ear got problem .
 the lousy school part is a totally different pitch and intonation
 gahment never lies ,  thus its not him confirm
 but lousy school comment sounded like different pitch and tone and intonation  .
 the word  &apos;lousy &apos; was said a particular way that is distinct .
 i assure u that i will vote for u nxt election
 lol bro there &apos;s oni one fact .
 oni one person had made the comment .
 it &apos;s not up to anyone &apos;s interpretation .
 chiu statement makes chiu sound like a wu lai lol .
 so tt vivian made a statement and he answered it himself ?
 they should admit who said that
 which one new sign up got rebate and cheapest now ?
 keen to know too
 speaking of which ,  mine too…… .
 buy wholesale electricity .
 once chiu go wholesale ,  chiu wont regret .
 but sp wholesale no fixed rate right
 dont have deals liao la .
 time for them to recoup .
 if got please sic
 i just signed up sembcorp for two years .
 rate per kwh is 0 .
 think today should be last day to sign up since sp electrical tariff will increase by tomorrow .
 in before sp wholesale
 chiu can ask on the oem thread there .
 state your average usage per month .
 else just use sp wholesale if your usage is high > 500/600 kwh/month
 ya hor ,   thanks ts for this reminder
 ohm lousy liao nobody use ?
 eat liao thirsty ?
   thirsty = msg gao gao; no thirsty = pang sim jiak
 nth is unhealthy .
 as long as everything eat moderately i think should be fine
 simple guide: anything that tastes good is unhealthy .
 yong tau hoo rice with soup should be healthy as well .
 u need to marinate the fish with soy sauce and sesame oil let it absorb then boil
 i came into this thread expecting to see ”it’s not healthy if chiu dine outside ,  but it’s healthy if chiu dabao” responses 
 have chiu tried before in public ?
 got people call imh come and catch chiu ?
 i saw before this guy took out a loaf of bread and placed every single slice on the hawker centre table .
 dirty af ,  i know ,  but seemed like he was taking stock of his bread .
 can chut fireball
 vampire can fly .
 drop werewolf from height can liao .
 werewolf see mah xiaoling zehzeh will turn into colour wolf .
 a person of culture ,  i see !
 i am partial to tremere .
 definitely this guy .
 never heard of thousands years age of werewolf or werewolf biting another human turning them into werewolf .
 sadako trumps both !
 actually ,  half of werewolf stories are of people bitten by another werewolf .
 the other half of the stories ,  are born with a werewolf gene .
 and then there are stories where there are both werewolves that were created and purebloods that were born .
 to be able to reproduce ,  as in ,  to give birth ,  which vampires can’t  .
 i’d say it’s a draw against living forever .
 u all dunno .
 snakes ,  king cobra are the strongest .
 vampire gets the girl ,  but werewolf gets their daughter .
 so who stronger ?
 vampire got one fatal weakness .
 they like dead people during the day .
 easily killed then .
 depends if u r pedobear or not .
 if course vampire
 last time quite easy to find ,  even those primary school stalls got that special taste mee rebus ,  i cant describe how &apos;s the taste like but i think most uncles know what i am talking about .
 bedok 58 there got one come close ,  but sauce is too thick .
 one of the worst actually
 thick peanut sauce will be in amk central hawker centre  .
 it’s like super thick
 famous cos last time got $2
 when come to food is up to individual taste .
 the famous nasi lemak stall at changi point .
 everyday long q .
 but to me it was average .
 in fact neighbouring mizzy stall taste better .
 for moi is the joo chiat one 
 bedok 58 got one new stall  ,  open beside the indian mee goreng that always open evening time .
 saw alot of people eat that mee rebus stall .
 parkway parade basement before the major renovation used to have a good mee rebus stall ,  young that time i take special bus trip to go there eat one .
 best mee rebus i &apos;ve ever had was a malaysian hawker .
 boiled with crab shell ,  it &apos;s got bits and pieces of crab there ,  with chopped prawn fritter and potato+tomato broth .
 sadly it &apos;s gone ,  now his franchaise called ramly mee rebus is all over but taste not quite the same .
 still good though .
 and they are not proud .
 eat my black seaweed nicer .
 amk central one better
 amk one jin ho jiak .
 serangoon garden … mee rebus ,  soto ayam and mee soto .
 i stay jurong and that’s the oni stall that can make me drive all the way there if i crave for good mee rebus .
 for me is sungei gedong camp canteen  
 rahim and afandi very good !
 their so call endemic sio .
 they have been preparing since sars .
 they are still preparing since sars
 they yolo and couldnt bother less .
 chiu die your problem
 at this rate not boom liao meh
 chiu can be lawyer .
 preparing vs prepared
 recover at home
 they are brain washed and felt entitled .
 do we have such a big population ?
 we are not them
 yall how old alrdy still believe miw
 oyk say he &apos;s prepared for 10k daily cases .
 now near 5k oni .
 no need to panic
 imagine if they din .
 singapore most probably cease to exist by now
 they are well prepare .
 but oni on the speech ,  power point ,  and charts part .
 when **** hits ,  then will scramble .
 good quality ft who actually create jobs are leaving .
 leeplaced by even more third world fake talent who are here to leech
 hood to see true colors .
 most are fairweather people .
 take spore gahment gif a good ride .
 then they can teh their lumpas lor .
 this is why we need to implement a defence tax equal to what local pay for cpf
 no chance to defend them one .
 before sh1t happens all gone liao…faster than chiu can imagine
 1 ftrashes out .
 3 ftrashes in .
 1 ctrashes out .
 300 ctrashes in .
 1 local their letters .
 3 , 000 ftrashes n ctrashes chiong in .
 pinkie and his friends welcome all foreign trash talents and chennai business park full of “south asian talents” .
 many many condominiums full of such “talents” who cannot make it back home - if all of these people can fug off then i’ll be delighted sia .
 if such sinkies did not and/or unable to ‘upgrade’ themselves ,   .
 wanna blame who leh ?
 just go la 1 expat go ,  3 will come replace them huan .
 not the first time liddat liao ,  they never wanted to stay here forever in the first place  .
 no mask hope they kena covid again and again until see they scared covid or covid scared them 
 why open big big liao ,  still people run away hah ?
 they should pay for public services like police ,  scdf ,  defense .
 to replace any 1 angmo who leaves ,  there are at least 10 million indians from india fighting and jostling to be first in queue to swarm into singapore .
 when choosing a city ,  expats are not bothered by mask wearing + group number limits .
 this is the truth .
 they want safety for themselves and their family .
 they wont get robbed or mugged .
 they want extremely high pay .
 they want generous housing allowance from employer .
 they want maids and servants .
 they want generous car allowance or free company car .
 they want a city where everything works .
 reminder that pap &apos;s retarded half assed flip flopping covid policies are a result of them giving in to 3rd world trash in the first place
 must ban face mask for foreigners  !
 oni sinkies carry the virus
 one group of expats go .
 another will come .
 these expats (might as well call them tourists) will seldom be happy to settle here
 do not come back here to work ever again
 go home and dont come back la bhutto
 this is another example of half or partial truth painted by the main stream media in singapore to suit their narrative .
 yes ,  it is true that quite a number of expat families have re-located from singapore over the last two years .
 i have had four expat colleagues that left singapore over the last two years ,  citing the strict covid restrictions here .
 but their jobs did not go to sinkies .
 it went to new fts coming into singapore ,  two for the first time .
 and i personally know of two expat families i know personally that just flew in over the new year via the quarantine free vtls from the us and hong kong .
 there is even one expat i knew who returned home in june 2020 at the height of the first wuhan wave .
 but came back in december 2021 cos he couldnt find a job back in his home country for 1 .
 in the end ,  he got a new job in singapore again through his white boys expats network .
 so much for fair weather fts; when they cannot find another better job elsewhere ,  they will still come back to singapore .
 else ,  chiu think the 400 or so imported daily covid cases are all incoming tourists eager to snap pictures at the merlion or sentosa ?
 for those who went to tourists spots like rws recently ,  you &apos;ll know it &apos;s a dead town at all the tourist spots with the majority of the restaurants catering to foreign tourists staying shut .
 at rws ,  the korean food court is closed for good and malaysia street is barely hanging on to its life ,  operating at 1/3 capacity .
 so even at an infection rate of 4% ,  400 imported covid cases daily simply means around 10 , 000 foreign travellers are flying into singapore every day and i dare say most of these incoming foreign travellers are not holding short-term tourist visa .

 chiu mean easy right .
 chiu sibei jialat oni think of piak but moi see ahlian damn sian their head empty one
 chomp chomp really small hawker centre
 cnt even protect own parents .
 sian ,  i thought fighting over 2am wendy potato .
 why want to fight but keep on shouting to call police ?
 just whack la .
 what started this ?
 who the guy wearing the white cap lul .
 jinfunny wanna fall down liao still holding cap
 is it cos they order nasi babi at rk house again
 police post closed ?
 police please arrest them and send them to jail for public affray under section 267a and 267b .
 people scared of police mah .
 haha shiok to see this .
 sinkies deserve this
 the red tee shirt guy can whack 2 of them lol .
 quick call police call police .
 chiu scold my father/mother  .
 someone tried to order nasi babi again ?
 all loud voice no action .
 mother kena whacked still so chill ?
 if it &apos;s me fugging chiong n hammer him oredi ,  let &apos;s go hospital together .
 make sure he learns not to hit a woman again .
 hey ,  how come rc never distribute mooncake goodies to all ome owners ?
 let atb masseuses work there la massage spa
 the gahment wont lose one ,  retail/rental make more money than rail business .
 this whole damn exchange above orchard station used to be a super huge popular bookstore .
 not sure if all chiu old birds can remember .
 but yes it is .
 maybe even way before saw &apos;s era .
 smrt used to own all these spaces since it &apos;s paid in full with coffers .
 they wont care whether it will rent out or not .
 sounds like jialat mgt from landlord
 oni jollibee or starbucks with many many seats for students can survive there .
 incidentally i was at raffles place x change and it seem lots of units are untenanted .
 i suppose that’s the familiar scene all over town .
 still smrt has not maximized its real .
 estate potential with it commanding all prime real estate space .
 dhoby exchange and then marina bay has fantastic empty unit for ages .
 some stations has the power utility occupiying the station space .
 any other country where the gahment use public transport’s marketting business and real estate business to subsidize cost ?
 want to copy the concept from the japanese but fail miserably… .
 japan underground metro malls got pet shops got arcade got alot fnb outlets… .
 singapore ones like walking through a ‘under construction’ site / shuttered corridor… really no life .
 seems like a good location but for some reason i’ve never seen smrt advertise it or heard about it or even manage to pass by it .
 the underground metro mall thing is not a  .
 japanese concept la .
 it &apos;s all over the world even in .
 city link is one example mah .
 just that this dunno what xchange thing was .
 japan jr and third sector railways like keio buy the land ,  build the railways and train stations ,  then build the shopping centers around the train station .
 ya is like sandwich upstairs .
 oni got popeyes and some wmother shops there
 oni bought food from poepeyes chicken last month ,  got a shock it’s like ghost town upstairs .
 even pre covid it was oredi a dead town .
 who da fug would wanna go there seriously ?
 i oni pass through to get to a bus stop .
 smrt as a landlord can enjoy the empty hoarded stores lor
 relocate the mrt gate entry to b1 ,  and shops to b2 .
 this will make more economical sense .
 everybody misses the retail and f&b there unless chiu are taking mrt and transferring a bus back home .
 its near the ion escalators to the bus stop along orchard boulevard .
 never even seen the entrance of it before .
 thats how much smrt bothers to advertise and help tenants .
 the location is actually damn good .
 just directly above orchard station all under shelter .
 it used to be a huge popular bookstore holding that space during the early days .
 actually should just rent the entire space out to don don donki they should be able to prosper but they act smart and sub-divide it into smaller shop units now so it &apos;s too late .
 why the article make me feel like my 3 years full time diploma sound useless ,  when anyone can get part time diploma ,  multiple somemore in just 2 years time…

 never that long  .
 no habit to nap leh
 secondary school time lor .
 always pattern same same ,  ownself say 5 minutes nap then go study .
 in the end ,  wake up is next day go school and study .
 5~4 hrs in one nap was probably the longest 
 way too long ,  going to have a hard time sleeping tonight .
 28hrs after drinking whole bottle of cough mix
 secondary school ,  back from a week excursion from pahang .
 woke up at 1630 hrs ,  next day .
 felt like waking up from coma .
 woke up at 9 cos my phone ring due to scam call .
 roll on bed for about an hour and woke up at 4pm .
 went to sleep at 4pm afternoon .
  wake up and see its 430 .
   get ready for dinner then stop and wonder why it &apos;s so dark .
 after death longest nap .
 i slept for 16 hours before after working 19 hours shift the day before .
 even after wake up still very very tired
 im shocked too  .
 normally l nap 2hrs the most
 a long nap is called sleeping liao
 nap cannot too long one .
 else feel more tired .
 im still in my nap .
 im replying from my long dreams .
 got once sleep at 2pm wake up next day 10am  .
 felt like slept for one year  look damn confused
 little wonder he was a divorcee .
 liar liar all the way .
 no integrity is worst or lousy school is worst ?
 the gahment should realize that this is never going to go away .
 better address it squarely head on than let it fester and let the opposition folks use them as cannon fodder .
 as they surely will 
 can be panties ?
 now koh is son of 10 kukujiao .
 every 4 yrs ,  this guy will always change parentage  .
 the voice is so distinctively lw &apos;s  i will need to go for ear examination soon .
 even my nephew who found last week n level listening comprehension tough due to the unusual accent said the voice was clearly that of lw .
 chiu dunnid guts to lie
 how can anyone be so shameless ?
 yah its not lw .
 if oni a few heard the lousy school comment as lw voice ,  then there &apos;s high chance these few heard it wrongly .
 but when most who heard it can identify that comment strongly as lw &apos;s unique voice ,  then there is strong evidence to suggest it is lw voice .
 it cannot be most heard it wrongly .
 to be identified later when some voice engineer use forensic tech to proof it is his voice will be a catastrophe for lw .
 he is really taking a huge risk .
 nope ,  public hair on fire better .
 no need boyzillian !
 what do chiu suggest ?
 and how trustworthy are our media ?
 ever heard of onscreen personality ?
 media will say the audio/video online are doctored ?
 when in doubt ,  vote all of them out
 there are better tools than this la .
 in courts people plenty of lawyers use voice analysis tools to argue who said what in recording
 would sug her kukujiao if i have to .
 will let him piak me deep deep
 nice very nice .
 lucky got boobies .
 did u accidentally forget to add a disclaimer at the end of your sentence - no homo ?
 too skinny for my liking
 can show me how dino chiu like ?
 ask  &apos;nevereatrice &apos; to give chiu a bj lor .
 do chiu remember chiu started a thread with literally the same thing ?
 would sug her kukujiao if i have to   
 i think is the clipboard paiseh
 siam bu bu ky scared later got kukujiao outta no where
 see liao really marikita
 i do know one or two person from smrt properties ,  now they are offering a 3 tier rental cut for 3 years .
 first year chiu pay less ,  second year chiu pay the average rent and 3 year chiu pay more .
 to help tenants cushion some of the impact with their cash flow .
 got such thing ?
 how come my friend’s one don’t have .
 oni new units ?
 for renewal contracts ,  need to bargain with them and tell them due to covid business been hit .
 they take back do what .
 traditionally ,  vampires are some of the strongest creatures in games .
 like witcher 3 they are imba .
 werewolves strong but not same level .
 must see is which type from which movie or drama .
 pap vampires are the most dangerous .
 werewolves fast attack speed .
 greater werewolves - super high regeneration .
 vampires not so strong damage .
 vampires level drain chiu - a kind of weakening .
 all your attributes drop .
 in short vampires attack a weakened chiu .
 when vampires die ,  must perform some action to make sure it doesnt resurrect .
 i think is pontianak 
 dracula is the father of all vampires .
 no werewolf can win him .
 vampire control werewolf .
 active at night .
 werewolf can oni active at night + full moon .
 cinematic universe failz at mummy liao
 who is the father of all werewolves ah ?
 vampire better ,  get to pump kirsten stewart
 bite whynpnt la .
 vampires stronger ,  werewolfs oni brute force ,  use saliva to fight .
  that’s why the vampires rule the werewolves .
 thats just how they pro-create mah ?
 dinosaurs lay egg .
  human have sex .
  doesnt mean dinosaurs weaker than humans .
 hybrid the most powerful  
 werewolf oso mah .
 oni got moon can transform 
 movies always put it as vampires smarter ,  werewolves physically stronger .
 oh i just recall one more place that got good mee rebus … the kimly coffeeshop at tradehub21
 last time parkway parade food court got 1 mee rubus always long queue  .
 duno shift to where nao
 this stall famous for mee soto ,  u go eat mee rebus ?
 this isn’t central right  ?
 at chong boon food centre ?
 where’s the marine parade mee rebus anyone knows ?
 those born in 80s would know
 they claim imm got staff canteen very nice  ,  anybody try before ?
 i know they got put chicken meat .
 haig road  ,  good ‘n’ jolly
 it is our neighbors .
 when young selling them in school tuckshop .
 now old grandma  .
 but still made for us only
 best mee rebus is at pulau ubin
 one of the cheapest ard ,  yes  .
 even their mee soto which used to be their  &apos;signature &apos; dish ,  now dunno what kind of msg they spam insai sumtimes can taste that salty salty aftertaste  .
 anw ,  if toking abt malayu mee rebus the one in haig rd that one in my honest opinion fweel much better than this inspirasi  .
 last time moi work ard paya lebar there ,  every 2-3 days in a week during lunchtime will jiak the mee rebus  .
 afandi hawa & family mee rebus ,  haig rd: mee rebus made with shrimp ,  flower crab & mutton
 ts have a simple life .
 satisfied by below average food
 those who missed the parkway basement one ,  it is now located at haig road hawker ,  facing the mall .
 one thing the bedok one does right is that they give alot of noodles ,  eat sure full one .
 definitely not true that inspirasi is the best mee rebus .
 i have eaten more than once there .
 the standard has dropped alot compared to the past .
 there are better mee rebus elsewhere in singapore .
 either the egg looks big or the plate is small
 haig road food centre has a stall that sells old school style mee rebus
 really thank to pap good foresight
 no issue la ,  the most kena squashed by 30-year loans nia
 yeah in my uncle time 12 years can finish paying  .
 then save fore retirement
 really jialat these days i tell u .
 no country is perfect .
 but when the people aspire for progress ,  and faced with huge loans  ,  its unpopular
 which country buy house .
 bo need huge loan
 lhl is a great leader !
 i just realised he looked like hp baxxter from scooter lmao
 compared to tw hong kong cheena is confirm better la .
 but it we need to always compare all these negative demonstrations to show that we are good ,  we are ignoring the problems and will soon lose the plot
 no need loan buy house ?
 later little pink angary sia .
 what he said is not entirely true oso .
 fairer to use multiples of annual income to judge affordability
 sinkies really earn 20k per month .
 no retrenchments or salary cut during this period .
 grads come work earn 10k per month ,  no traineeships at all .
 many good years ahead
 multiple of annual income  .
 he was not wrong .
 choose between matured estates ,  town and new estates .
 no one ask u to buy those 4room bto that cost half a million
 heng moi house is bought when it cost 5 digits oni .
 simi lanjiao he talking .
 house so expensive .
 he in ivory tower too long .
 totally disconnect from the ground .
 not all sinkie can buy new flats .
 new one is getting ex yet quality no std
 moi too young so oni knew boxing from tyson &apos;s era .
 float like butterfly sting like bee style was the best ?
 depends on the what chiu want believe .
 not steven lim ?
 well known for his dazzling footwork and his unorthodox defense style .
 dunno about goat but i think tyson is the most dominant boxer ever .
 boxers actually fear and dont want to step into the same ring as tyson .
 and all his knock outs are extremely impressive .
 tyson is a beast lol ,  ali i think is more of a tactician .
 note i oni post those who posted their images public on social media before aka facebook / friendster / blogspot era .
 got many more not posted ,  outing photos no count -1sss

 diploma is oredi useless when idiotic employers recognized degrees from some village in delhi more just cos of the word degree
 she is much better than me .
 i &apos;ve oni obtained multiple fractures .
 it’s been about 2 years of covid pandemic .
 what sort of diplomas are these in which several can be simultaneously obtained by an individual during this timeframe ?
 i would like to give her multiple orgasms
 actually at her age is just for fun or goal fulfilment oni .
 i doubt she will actually use the cert for anything .
 nevertheless good for her .
 likely she is studying for interest ,  self fulfillment etc ,  not for a new job 
 local polytechnic can go fly kite oredi .
 full time studying minimum 3 years to get a diploma .
 she can get multiple within 2 years plus ,  local institution must be damn lousy at teaching .
 no uptron no talk .
 she may not want to stay around to replace jyj as the station ah mah .
 she may be calling it quit if the tv station decided to give her a lousy contract and showing her some major disrespect .
 2 yrs obtain multiple diplomas ?
 no wonder our academic certs all no value now ,  so easy to get so many diploma ?
 is there a catch in the article ?
 ok leh my side can see .
 what browse are chiu using ?
 chrome on mobile 
 not sure what &apos;s this related to the thread .

 jews are very cliquish in big companies .
 to me ,  i consider them to be the white version of indian nationals .
 they have this under-siege mentality and always keep the lucrative jobs among themselves .
 alot of  &apos;closet jews &apos; in nyc .

 why hr need angmo ?
 less angmo cyclists pests doing tour of singapore ,  more of a certain race in condo pools  ,  then sillyporeans complain again .
 satki angmo life is very very easy here .
 lol hr oso need expat ?
 another one will come and replace him/her .
 they really think they are talent ?
  and singapore will solely missed them ?
 people have option to go countryside live a less stressful life .
 u telling sinkies to upgrade to continue rat race .
 your int jin satki .
 the shiny welcome to sinkie brochure looks very chim but reality on the ground is different
 i go sheng siong can get 10 pack of eggs at $1 .
 75 depending on market and season but go ntuc minimum chao chao $2 for the  &apos;pasar &apos; eggs at ntuc .
 ntuc  &apos;fairprice &apos; really is  &apos;fair &apos; price .
 moi is give sheng siong  &apos;excellent &apos; price .
 ntuc got one period all eggs very cheap .
 like buy 2 free 1 .
 fairprice has 10eggs for $1 .
 next time u go and look in egg section ,  smartchoice or something .
 sheng shiong got many other things oso cheaper than ntuc .
 ntuc is pricing itself out of the market .
 feed too many jlb .
 wow i think cs would be unsatisfactory .
 need ng chee meng and fellow jlb salary ofcourse cannot give bonus like sheng shiong .
 sheng siong many things cheaper than ntuc
 ntuc oni if your area doesnt have sheng siong .
 ntuc like to leave the rrp high high and then ownself promo until the  &apos;normal &apos; price range of other stores to bruff chewren  
 ss eggs are bigger oso ,  compared to ntuc one .
 not every items .
 some are more ex
 giant vegetables oredi cheaper than fair price liao
 moi usually is buy from ss the 10+2 60g egg @$2 .
 so far budget eggs between the 2 has been quite reasonable .
 500gm for 10 eggs ,  thats abt the decent size .
 cheaper ones at $1 .
 45: newborn eggs from ss .
 a wee bit smaller ,  maybe lesser than 500gms in a pack .
 tried the latter before .
 not that bad imo
 that was the time gahment and ccs panic buy from poland i think .
 then buy 20 get 10 for $4 thats fun .
 now no more liap
 i recently bought the pasar eggs oso $2 from fp ,  i remember last time was $1 .
 pasar eggs are not the cheapest now .
 fp inhouse brand smart choice is 1 .
 it &apos;s not fixed .
 thats why if u see it as reasonably priced ,  must fhfl  .
 but depends if u really need it oso or has space left to keep it in the fridge
 gamble some more la ?

 songs your granny listens to 
 nowadays most songs are trash
 chiu need to move on with the times 
 obviously chiu havent watched  &apos;van helsing &apos;  .
 i thought vampires are faster than werewolves ?
 maybe chiu saw them is faster movement ,  switch to flight mode all that .
 combat wise they &apos;re more caster ,  spell type ,  drain  &apos;essence &apos; eg .
 depends whether turn into werewolf still can think like human .
 werewolves are stronger on full moon .
 vampire bite werewolf become what .
 werewolf scratch vampire become what
 for me i am team bella
 mix of both better .
 tiagong werewolves are vampire &apos;s pets ,  maciam dogs are human pets .
 if vaccines can make them up lorry then both is not strong 
 moi use werewolf always beat the vampire one last time in games .
 twlight isit wtf 
 rich > vampire = **g off .
 rich > werewolf = **g off
 i thot edmwers prefer zombies apocalypse
 train to busan ?
 when did he say this ?
 going to be sinkie now !
 5 years oredi can cash out and sell at million dollars .
  moi alsho want to ballot tio prime location bto .
 moi is bbfa ,  notch applicable .
 why must degrade other countries to make yourself feel good ?
 cant we just foster better relations and keep the peace ?
 he said thiese words to make young sinkies think it is farking worth to pay 600k and above to buy a 5 room bto in clementi .
 cos it is cheap ,  afforable and damn near town  !
 (i dont get the mofo idea why is clementi near town  ?
 not much places u can buy a 5 room size hdb for just $700 , 000  .
 credit must be given due  .
 needs to produce the pap elite who said it .
 otherwise saying i didnt do it is insufficient for matter to end just like that
 no need to doubt that all of them are from the same party and are doing good cop bad cop routine .
 lawrence said not him means not him hor 
 means pap is a party that condones liars .
 they dont take actions when their party members lie in broad daylight  .
 what a lousy party !
 but i won’t be surprised when vivian is goh chok tong’s age ,  he will write book to reveal the truth about the ri is a lousy school comment 
 if it was workers party who said it ,  be prepared everyday media start shaming them for being irresponsible ,  no dignity .
 i assure chiu ,  his reply is as transparent as pap .
 who wants to buy such crap .
 its one thing when they &apos;re in power and people buy such crap in bulk .
 but see so many of lky &apos;s many books destined to be recycled for better use like toilet paper .
 those rich companies and businessmen who spent tons on his autographed books ,  i wonder how they feel .
 irony is someone who come out and urge them to admit it and apologize cos integrity is so important  .
 that person is tt vivian
 chiu know i know can liao .
 mandela effect maybe
 the correct ans is vat do chiu think
 keep replay task force beedio chiu will nose hu liao lor .
 till now ,  none of them dare to admit ?
 when it comes to taking credits ,  all of them cant wait to show face .
 this is called xiasuay to the max .
 luckily ,  these comments not passed by opposition ,   else we will see this becomes our daily headlines .
 time to ask vb whether he made the lousy school comment liao .
 got to double confirm not made by lw .
 if not him ,  then who ?
 dont tell me vivian was talking to himself ?
 why parliament got such unsound people in the house ?
 any experts here know how to do voice identification ?
 use the  &apos;lousy &apos; comments to compare to his own speech .
 see if he still can deny .
 not interested in dating anyone now

 mee rebus is just mee rebus .
 just some noodles with sauce .
 i think not much different between different stalls .
 tanglin halt best .
 freshly ground spices .
 high ses jiak mee rebus mai hum .
 does other races here  sell mee rebus as well meh  .
 the  &apos;secret &apos; of mee rebus lies in its sauce or gravy  ,  that what make or break the jhj-ness of it  .
 cos the yellow noodle itself and the hard boiled egg nothing special ,  even if chiu were add some cheekon and sambal in it to go with chiur mee rebus  .
 actually hor ,  whenever moi at budok int hawker moi without fail wud buy the economical nasi lemak instead  .
 the one the signboard that simply named nasi lemak  .
 add 1 cheekon wing ,  1 long flat fishcake and 1 luncheon meat all less than $3  .
 plus a pack full of rice (50cents nia) if dabao  ,  damn worth value huan  .
 old school is using sweet potatoes based gravy .
 i find mee rebus ,  mee soto most places taste the same .
 and toban extent mee siam

 hdb bigger size leh for same price / rental .
 but yup ,  its low ses
 quite a few of my coy expats came here with the expectation that they can travel and explore south east asia .
 they were disappointed these years due to covid restrictions .
 the timing too suay for them .
 but dont feel sorry for them ,  they are on inter coy transfer and free to go back after 3 years .
 robert sun walk home  .
 the elite management style oni the south east asia and cheena citizen can take it .
 other nationalities will struggle .
 it &apos;s very different mindset .
 these expats come here to command and conquer meaning making decisions .
 not listening to decisions from our elites .
 serve and fxxx off .
 if cant have everything ,  would rather have nothing .
 it would be sad and tragic if it is ultimately foreigners that can convince the gahment to do certain things while citizen opinions hold no sway .
 byebye ,  dont come back then
 ss eggs or other stuff  ,  sometimes it is really cheaper than ntuc .
 but ss fresh prawns ,  sometime is more expensive than giant .

   got this brand ah ?
   never see before

 ntuc is the fairest price set by gahment and unions .
 too cheap is unfair price .
 that is call fair price not cheapo price  .
 the pap has how many people in ntuc ?
 not sure of the reason but am sure u should be aware that the price will never stick to the same ,  permanently .
 maybe this week cost $x .
 next week cld be either up or down by xx cents
 which low ses outlet store it ?
 amk hub ,  tpy mrt ,  j8 all have .
 angmo supermarket has items that are cheaper than either sheng siong and ntuc .

 it depends on how many vampires vs werewolves .
 if two vampires against 20 werewolves ,  werewolves will win .
 by the way vampires and werewolves rumoured to be from the dark hold book .
 so one  scarlet witch will own them all gaogao
 depends on your definition of stronger .
 have chiu seen werewolves own castles ?
 stronger as in fighting lor .
 not fight money .
 vampire oso mah .
 vampire stronger unless full moon
 before gay shinning vampires become popular ,  werewolves are typically use as minions or followers by vampires in many rpg setting one .
 so in most story vampire is much more op than werewolves or even the master of werewolves .
 in most fiction ,  vampires are more powerful but i think that is really most due to their mind control and charm .
 hence most vampires have alot of underlings even powerful ones which make them very powerful .
 in a one on one fight ,  i dont see how werewolves are inferior  .
 in fact vampires weakness to sun is one major achilles heel .
 i know werewolves weakness to silver but come on  .
 being killed by sunlight is one major weakness .
 werewolves better cos vampires suck .
 think is depend which fantasy setting .
 cause in many high fantasy fiction ,  the higher level vampire ,  especially those ancestral lord and elder level is either immune to sunlight or have some form of sun resistance that enable them to still survive or even live normally under sunlight .
 just that in most case even if they are immune to sun normally they can oni fully utilize their mythical dark power (as high fantasy fiction lord and elder level vampire normally process the same dark power as demon and devil ,  but unlike demon and devil their dark power are weaker in the daze) at night nia ,  but they still able to retain most of their traditional power in daze time like charm & mind control ,  immunity to physical harm aka immortal ,  transformation into mist or creature etc .
 in many high fantasy fiction the high tier vampire oso no have physical form and\or wont appear in their true physical body form one ,  so to kill them is have to find their hidden real body\corpse else even the stick through heart method is wont be able to kill them .
 vampyres get more chiobus
 cai png sellers stronger .
 they got choppers made with silver n whole body smell of garlic .
 who cares 3rd world country problem  
 dropping liao ,  an la .

 will chiu take the job if your pay is 50% more ?
 piak first think later 
 i took a part time 20h per week wfh job that pays 70-80% of my previous full time 45h salary .
 i busy doing 2 other business and my life is so happy now .
 no i dont work with any sinkie .
 i work with americans and prc sibei song
 hws they pays chius ?
 four or five figures ?
 depends on which company & team
 if chiu are the oni remote sinkie in the job role ,  all your colleagues are in us ,  then how ?
 according to sinkie ,  more money = more priority and respect tio bo ?
 so if gahment truly want to inculcate culture of giving up seat ,  why not charge higher fares to those who need them ?
 if they pay higher fare ,  regular sinkie confirm obligated to give up seats for them mah .
 tiagong now benchmark is at least a $1 .
 why no mention of little butterfly ?

 where &apos;s the chio .
 error 404 nothing to see .
 why people still confused ?
 no one confused .
 just some ccp ib always trying to link ccp with cheena and use this pretext against people condemning ccp as inciting racial hate against chinese people .
 ccp is not cheena ,  ccp is not chinese people .
 fuck fascists ccp .
 yes ,  similar to pap is not singapore ,  kmt and dpp are not roc .
 common sense is not common to brainwashed people .
 but the people enables them .
 silence is violence .
 why must chiu open a thread just to say this .

 not all mee rebus are made the same ,  if u know u know .
 once me bought this mee rebus to dabao ,  thinkin &apos; to just get my crave & nothin &apos; much else .
 nothin &apos; wrong w/ the taste of the gravy but the texture is like way gooey ,  as if it &apos;s liddat 10/20 cents glue that we used in nursery or pri school time ,  u know the one in a small round tube (multi colored) where attached on its lid is the mini spoon to scoop the glue out .
 that gooey albeit edible 
 haha less people know da better
 your reply above is way off from my question asked 
 this thread really making me hungry !
 so far cant find .
 this is what moi heard too .
 no just tao cheo ,  peanut .
 really have ah ?
 thot got some history or funny incident abt btp that me have no idea of   .
 anw btp how big niaa  .
  can say quite easy to narrow it down  
 yes ,  though rare .
 it &apos;s oredi listed by one of the posts above @ 409 amk .
 yes ,  in my neighborhood ,  there &apos;s one uncle sim who sells mee rebus  .
 residents in this estate all know him and say his mee rebus is kyky
 i love the mee rebus at old tanjong pagar railway station .
 coming to a decade liao ,  seldom jiak cos cant find anything close to it  .
 sometimes got craving then i will go p&z at geylang rd ,  their mee rebus oso not bad
 feel like me am dead set on a bowl right now !
 why are all the good food  stalls located way out of my zone ?
 amk 409 is best mee rebus .
 best malay one is after lor 3 geylang along main road .
 this guy is just trying to act cute with his replies .
 the stall at our tampines hub just up their price to from $3 .
 50 to $4 for mee rebus ,  mee siam and lontong .
  with 10% kpt card discount it is $3 .
 60 which i still find it to be expensive for noodle ,  gravy and egg .
 the best is the one nearest to chiu .
 not worth traveling more than 2km for mee rebus .
 the real deal used to be the stall at basement food court of parkway parade .
 big portion & yummy .
 just different people here will type in their own way
 i say before liao ,  it &apos;s vb ,  not lw .
 pap might beautify data ,  but one thing they will not do is to lie about such thing .
 so i do believe him if he says it &apos;s not him .
 but if it &apos;s proven it &apos;s really him ,  then my belief above will no longer hold .
 ask vb directly la .
 dex wong failed to ask the obvious follow up question .
 then minister lw ,  can chiu tell us who was it who said that ?
 i assure chiu … first line oredi give away liao… what a liar… no means no… short and sweet…
 then sld ask him what does he thinks of such person that gives such comment ?
 let &apos;s all go the bdsm way      
 and papship kopes .
 vb must apologise to rafflesians then .
 vb say knn oredi say it &apos;s him it &apos;s him it &apos;s him .
 how many times chiu want him to eat dead cat  ?
 monk &apos;s hill is tsl .
 the one who started with  &apos;illiterate &apos; confirm is vivi .
 no doubt ,  character is permanent .
 but there is still other voices .
 so now vb is holding something of lw .
 ccs should nose house to pray this game
 that dex wong did not ask lw who did make the comment ?
 i recall someone got away with the polling station rule by having a certain entity issued statement about perimeter of the polling station .
 so magic can happen .
 wong asking wong 
 whoever made the comment does not matter unless it came from the mouth of the person heading ministry of education .
 the rule dont cover teleportation la 
 if all said is true ,  it seems 7th month oredi alots of absurd things happened .
 even on parliament ,  mics suddenly turn  &apos;hot &apos; ,  minister &apos;s mind wonder  &apos;back to the future &apos; in sec schools ,  even  talk to themselves .
 anyone here or it is normal if someone had  &apos;habit of self-talk &apos;  ?
 (because i don &apos;t) .
 does miw need to see by imh ?
 contract end ,  company cannot afford to renew such expensive contract .
 dont let the door hit chiu on the way out  .
 sent by a cotton-making sheep
 have a safe flight out .
 rmbr never to cum back hor .
 naise way to put it .
 could be retrenched .
 all these so called expat talents are a drain of good money .
 good my nsf son no need defence them .
 at least foreigners get to choose .
 how about sinkies ?
 can go anywhere else ?
 can choose if want to serve ns ?
 don’t go back ever again to work
 correct rental alone is 18/2k .
 wa ,  looks like she cant wait for herself & family to experience omicron sia  .
 and then what kind of expat is this sia .
 most likely she took up another jod within the organisation which requires her to be at ny .
 then dont conveniently say pack your bags for ny mah .
 sibei ungrateful sia this am .
 gave her family free vaccine ,  kept them safe this is what singapore gets in return .
 see my other thread comment on same topic .
 in new york crime rate is very high .
 chances of her or her hubby getting shot is much more likely in new york .
 cost of living in new york is even higher than in singapore .
 so this article is not telling the truth .
 they are moving for other unspoken reasons .
 mask wearing and group number limits in singapore are insignificant matters .
 nyc property prices make us look like manila
 not even counting tax rates in us and ny and nyc .
 city public schools are oso shiteholes in nyc .
 need to go private schs
 happy getting omicron in the us
 chiu wont be missed .
 thank chiu for leaving .
 please dont even com ehere again
 it &apos;s always been like this .

 hope chiu step on lego on your way out and kena hoot by blm when chiu reach nyc .

 one of those recommendations will likely include vetting of potential candidates by an  &apos;independent panel &apos; on eligibility to stand as a candidate .
 that will likely rule out lmw ,  lt  chiu name it and be like the pe going forward .
 this is my guess .
 what is the point of all that drama if chiu do not milk maximum political currency from it ?
 slaughter one as a warning
 pinky panties so wet in 2022 .

 lw is not stupid enough to leave a written note to contradict himself later .
 lw:  &apos;character means having integrity ,  having honesty .
 looks like the conversation is between vivi & tsl .
 this shows the credibility and integrity of pap style and their ibs .
 chiu die your own problem(talking about v coming to own up) everything will be pushed to the person who died .
 chiu noticed those ibs taking a really similar approach as supporting what that 2 face guy is saying .
 saying it &apos;s oni 1 person .
 it &apos;s so simple .
 that guy has been doing videos on social media ,  interviews and so on .
 just have the balls to read out  &apos;must have been from a lousy school &apos; and let everyone hear and judge if it &apos;s really not him .
 just listen to lw &apos;s speech .
 it &apos;s his way of speaking .
 subconsciously ,  lw have a tendency ,  when pronouncing 2 syllabus words to make it particularly clear(2 sound) compared to v .
 again like what i &apos;ve said earlier ,  go listen to the audio again for 10x .
 disclaimer: i used to support and like lw for the way he &apos;s been handling the covid situation .
 until this incident .
 the latest comment that he made to say that he didnt say that ,  it really disgust me to the max .
 will vb admit he made the lousy remark .
 the interviewer never admit  &apos; if not chiu .
 why keep quiet when the ground point finger at chiu ?
 mai spread fear hor .
 the cs ,  institution all the same .
 just different group leading .
 new broom sweeps clean .
 all cleared up ,  lw for pm  .
 dare to do ,  not man enough to admit
 let these people be sia .
 as i said ,  sibei ungrateful liao .
 some people really is no see coffin wont shed tears 1  .
 let them really go experience ny then they will realise singapore is heaven sia .
 she say what cannot travel freely then what parents din get to see her newborn kid .
 this is sibei myopic and short-sighted sia
 hope they keep in touch so will know how’s covid in new york
 a few of my big angmo clients left oredi .

 can someone explain how is moving to new york now any better ?
 my friend just moved out of new york to another state cos it &apos;s so horrible there right now .
 oh noes  ,  pinky will notch be happy to see his beloved ft expats one by one leaving  .

 until someone chiu are close to died of covid then chiu know the effects of exchanging limited freedom versus auto roaming
 100 cecas waiting for leeplace

 committee of privileges will present findings on raeesah khan case  &apos;in due course &apos;: tan chuan jin​ .
 raeesah khan testifies before the committee of privileges on dec 3 ,  2021 .
 singapore: the committee of privileges has “looked at” the formal complaint against former workers’ party member of parliament (mp) raeesah khan’s breach of parliamentary privilege and “will be presenting (its) findings and recommendations to parliament through (its) report in due course” .
 in a blog entry posted on the parliament website on monday (jan 3) ,  speaker of the house tan chuan jin said the committee of privileges “will thoroughly investigate the complaint to uphold the sanctity and integrity of parliamentary privilege” .
 “the recent complaint that we looked at – and for which we will be presenting our findings and recommendations to parliament through our report in due course – is an important reminder that mps must not wilfully abuse the immunity and privileges being an mp accords them , ” he said .
 ms khan ,  formerly an mp for sengkang grc ,  resigned in november after she admitted to lying in parliament about a sexual assault case ,  which she had claimed was mishandled by the police .
 she was referred to the committee for breach of parliamentary privilege after her confession .
 mr tan said in his blog that all mps enjoy parliamentary privilege ,  which gives them immunity from prosecution and civil lawsuits for the statements they make in the chamber so that they may speak freely on matters and issues .
 “nonetheless ,  the onus oso lies with every mp to apply due diligence and responsibility even as we exercise this privilege .
 statements made must be based on facts or well-substantiated information , ” he said .
 “the committee of privileges thus takes any formal complaint about breaches of privilege seriously ,  and i ,  as the speaker of parliament ,  am the chair of this ssc (standing select committee) .
 the committee has released special reports to parliament ,  summarising the key points from evidence given by ms khan ,  as well as involved parties including the leaders of the workers’ party .
 who’s so blind to marry her
 how come this article is free ,  no need subscriber to login ?
 lhl finally fix his opposition as per what he mentioned in rally speech .
 kick people down .
 now rubbing them in the dirt .
 hey the people will know what to do la
 we are more interested to know what will happen to the other 3 wp members
 if rk not punished gaolat gaolat really no eyes see  !
 paid open access so we can “benefit” from the report
 so busy  ,  no wonder ig posts has been far and by the way    
 now it &apos;s time for the prosecutor to turn judge ,  to pass the verdict .
 cut off the bitxch and move on
 they noticed whole country laughing at edwin is it ?
 what’s the point of the findings from a group of people acting as judge ,  jury and executioner all roll into one ?
 papship sure kope cos tcj .
 this type macam one way traffic nia ,  need simi popcorn 
 chiu mean those stuff discussed in the world economic forum ?
 stuff like  &apos;fourth industrial revolution &apos; and  &apos;the great reset &apos; ?
 is ts hinting at chai-na world dominacion ?
 yes ,  but or maybe more than that ?
 cheena rise to power and then eu got more to gain with a powerful cheena .
 india and sea will get suppressed by cheena .
 then our guys go cheena to work as construction workers and women go there to work as maids .
 oni cheena can save us now~ 
 the world order will not change so easily .
 the greys aliens had designed and controlled this order for many centuries .
 unless the lizards aliens gain influence .
 save us from them ?
 they &apos;ve been salivating at us like a wolf staring at a sheep
  &apos;if chiu were to summarize the march of physics over the last 10 , 000 years ,  it would be the distillation of the laws of nature into four fundamental forces .
  gravity ,  electricity and magnetism ,  and the two nuclear forces .
 newton &apos;s law unleashed the industrial revolution .
 faraday’s law unleashed the second great industrial revolution .
 the next source of energy nuclear fission or dark energy will unleash the next revolution .
 actually im personally a believer of nuclear fission too .
 cant imagine if everything &apos;s nuclear powered in future .
 chiu have nuclear science knowledge ?
 lol believer in nuclear fission
 actually what is there to suppress when countries changed their side to cheena .
 big bro will not have the whole globe .
 they will have to share half of the globe with tiong .
 big bro cannot suka suka start war like in the past they did it to middle east .
 as for singapore ,  familee prefer to stand leader together with big bro than under ccp with same skin color .
 thats how nuclear power is generated these days what .
 im not racist .
 i dont regard cheena as my motherland .
 the chinese in cheena are not the same as those in taiwan or malaysia or singapore .
 dont worry ,  i worry more about pinky &apos;s era -old/undead lee era
 this is the retribution for anyhow insulting people .
 do chiu know people scold chiu is for your own good .
 scold somemore la .
 i oso join in and anyhow scold people .
 some say nuclear fusion is the holy grail .
 fission is unclean and produce radioactive waste .
 anyway ,  the point is ,  industrial revolution is powered by energy .
 imagine mankind will be able to travel to distant galaxies etc .
 thats why i keep emphasising we need to invent unlimited clean energy to improve lives .
 first ,  it will prevent pollution .
 second ,  more kind of tech will be able to research and improve .
 third ,  cost of living will be reduced .
 there is oni two new world order that earthlings need to fear .
 the ccp world order and the wrath of mother earth world order .
 both will lead to the demise of entire modern human civilization .
 actually i dont believe that the  &apos;new world order &apos; that we commonly referred to got any relation to ccp .
 the commonly known  &apos;new world order &apos; if come to light ,  more like is a plan that is administered by various countries together .
 let them enjoy la .
 since so fuck up policies .
 later they make noise again
 chiu seem like a very righteous person .
 maybe from 22 july to 18 august ,  chiu should go out and catch all those offenders and report them to the authorities .
 maybe chiu get national day medal for it .
 please let people have their moment .
 i am sure they know what is right and wrong unlike those ktv guys .
 so early one meh ?
 i always thought they mostly do night visit ?
 i think it’s more about being socially responsible i guess .
 preese dont be lacist  
 why never baotoh those watch ndp celebrations ?
 cb ts ,  can dont attack fellow sinkies or not ?
 better don’t stir them
 faster report them !
 ts must be ceca .
 cos those are multi racial pax ?
 ts oni aiming malay ?
 delay a few days then tighten la .
 anyway not much diff la unless got go ktv la .
 later glass heart broken anyhow post people call mata to catch no good lah
 let people enjoy their festival la .
 anw oso not they spread  .
 is those hup sup guy go chiong ktv that caused this  .
 if chiur skin is yerrow chiu better stfu ,  dont gib dem more race card ammo .
 skarli huan disgruntled neighbour buey lun liao take axe confront dem .
 gg tomorrow headrines daijiduadiao all the white and black dogs bark lacist again
 ok leh ,  my malay neighbours didnt even go out .
 what shit chiu stirring ?
 hope chiu get csi out .
 what if they later engineer the recording to prove that it wasn &apos;t lw voice and say that audio taken over the internet is not reliable .
 i tried to pin the voice on vb .
 but it &apos;s very hard to imagine vb saying  &apos;lousy &apos; with equal emphasis on the  &apos;zee &apos; sound .
 now u know who is the real power hungry one .
 how come suddenly got audio leaks on ccs .
 why someone always like to run to centre stage during covid .
 who is throwing oyk under the bus right now .
 oyk is never in the pm race ,  his portfolio is always side tracked away from the pm route .
 the oleeginal oredi spread all over the internet ,  now too late to do hand-leg anymore
 dont think its him .
 so obvious it &apos;s lw who said it .
 but still got kumgongs who think otherwise .
 then why as a minister ,  he did not correct the person who made this comment ?
 he agree not all schools are good ,  some are lilousy ?
 if its miw and people liddat sham asking ,  will still press on and force an answer out whether he agrees with the comment or not even if he says he did not make it
 it’s obviously the voice is lw but if he dare to say it publicly it’s not him then we just have to suck it up
 looks like the 3g got to hang around longer liao
 hmmm ,  not lw then who .
 no one admitted  .
 parliament must be haunted
 who &apos;s school is lousier ?
 the one that didnt taught integrity ?
 oso sounded like lw to me ,  but since he publicly say not him and we oso cannot prove it &apos;s him ,  then it &apos;s between him and vivian to settle liao
 vivi bala oredi tank the damage for monks hill and lousy school
 quite scary if its confirmed to be him and  he can still nonchalantly  deny he said it .
 definitely is him lor .
 see he turned his head towards his right at the same time saying those remarks when tsl just seated down .
 really a pinocchio .
 maybe he overheard the private comments and just turned his head .
  the comment so rude and loud .
  if i was there ,  i would oso turn my head to give vv the (tsk) look .
 i listened to the audio .
  sounded like from the same person .
  but i not csi or audio expert .
 maybe someone can zoom in the video to see whether his mask got move move a bit .
  he’s wearing the normal cheap surgical mask .
  talk talk can see a bit of movement .
 some say always jiak jap bentos dont make u obese like cai png .
 but price diff is big sia .
 bento quality ,  cai png is quantity .
 see which one u prefer and feel more worth
 bento package look nice .
 cai png uses styrofoam box .
 bento ,  all the different dishes are separated in compartments ,  taste not mixed .
 cai png all throw together ,  mix until like pig feed ,  very low ses .
 chiu use bento tray to dabao cai png = bento
 difference is some can afford jap bento .
 some oni can eat cai png .
 some ask mother to cook and leech off the food .
 price big difference
 just like fu cking an atb is vastly different from fu cking a nipponbu .
 bibimbap oso low ses ,  how come so expensive ?
 should price it the same as cai png .
 cai png more rice than bento .
 nasi padangmore rice than bento .
 but nasi padang and cai png same same different dish selection
 cai png + short grain rice = bento
 low ses moi is can jiak whatever thrown to moi ,  beggar cannot choose
 sounds like food court jap bentos .
 cai png is life
 which one more nice to jiak
 cai png - easy ,  no fuss packaging .
 integrated dishes for a wholesome experience in dining .
 bento - compartmentalized dining to taste different dishes at their own peak .
 end joy the same .
 my fren who always go jpn says their train bentos are one of the finest food .
 as it goes ,  anything foreign is more expensive .
 bibimbap is fixed ingredients ,  all the texture and taste is harmonized when eaten together .
 cai png curry mix with tomato sauce mix with soy sauce ,  all stir together is like rubbish .
 cai png if different dish served in separate bowls will be nicer ,  like some peranakan dinner set .
 remember last time gotch someone post her wedding beedio  .

 most likely will be a bbfa my whole life 
 alot of people divorce oso .
 walan 23yo oni .
 thats what i keep telling myself too ,  but sometimes at night will think about this…
 i 32yo still never hold gerl hand before   
 why worry ,  alot of time .
 if pandemic becomes worse ,  maybe chiu will be the last male on earth n can have all the females .
 that’s what i told myself when i was 18 ,  20 and 22   .
 mai kia…xx age only…but the older i get the more jialat i feel
 get a life first ,  i am serious .
 girls will come when chiu have one .

 chiu should feel happy about it .
 most likely me at 32 
 i see my friends ,  got 2 couple married ,  got bto and kid oredi 2-3yi le 
 if chiu keep living life worrying like its gonna run out ,  chiu will never fully enjoy life .

 my math failed .
 that lau ban tau huey zui price up 20c from $1 .
 they are going with the flow
 this up is due to covid .
 in fact most prices has been going up since the start of the 2021 ,  just that recently announced gst ,  people take noticed and thought it &apos;s due to gst
 test test balloon first
 price now increased for cny .
 gst will increase again 
 food all these small things la .
 most impt is merc bmw audi rolex pp rm got increase bo ?
 the ban mian i ate yesterday increased by 50 cents 
 the price rise is due to inflation ,  not gst .

 it &apos;s the illuminati
 cheena will resist the new world order 
 the illuminati card game by steve jackson released in 1994 have many cards depicting a new world order .
 i more into the anti-matter particles
 to truly progress to a kardashev type 1 civ (world-city; able to harness energy on a planetary scale) ,  it would take a literal new world order to do so .
 more than just an anemic and toothless un .
 there are many things that we are oredi capable of ,  just lacking the collective political will to carry it through and advance ourselves .
 thats why for most of our history ,  such advances oni come through after huge bouts of war and/or pandemic .
 to be forced into action ,  so to speak .
 new world order is not scary .
 but the scary thought is how many people need to die before that happen .
 new world order ?
 the leader tiagong is hulk hogan
 so new world order can do wat
 simpsons got talk about this ?
 new world order means what 
 we need keanu reeves
 where can buy this card game ah ?

 he is a fresh graduate .
 deployed him to tag along with a non-graduate technician supervisor for on the job training with a team of technicians ,  do some technical work to understand the nature of the work and challenges we face so that when he is leading the team he knows how to respond and have better working synergy with the technical team .
 after a month ,  he tendered his resignation and refused to share the reason for his departure other than he has found a better offer .
 i suspect he is strawberry ,  unable to handle the work environment and his colleagues .
 knn ,  the company employed him for one month and the company is willing to overpay him ,  to train him for a couple of months and he left oni after a month .
 most likely he left this job for an air-conditioned office job .
 where to find engineers who are willing to sweat under the hot sun and manage rough employee ?
 my boss just texted me to seek for overseas engineers to fill this position .
 civil ,  mech  ,  electrical ,  chemical or marine ?
 why didnt employ lao jiao
 mechanical ,  refrigeration system .
 the supervisor is a very lao jiao .
 chiu pay him how much ?
 he is a fresh graduate ,  $3 .
 the supervisor is the to ?
 maybe he give the young engineer problem behind the scene ?
 kor kor chiu got internship mah can offer moi
 he is on a 5 days week .
 he opt to do food delivery ?
 own target own time no boss to report to ?
 ceca gonna take over the position soon .
 knn become kkn .
 no wonder your junior engineer left .
 what is wrong with going for a better job ?
 what job is it anywhere ?
 i fine the to is ok .
 he may be rough ,  stern ,  spews vulgarities but otherwise willing to teach .
 he knows that this chap will be his direct supervisor in a few months time ,  doubt he dares to give him problems .
 there &apos;s always two sides to a story .
 think about it ,  if the job pays decently well ,  good environment and good co-workers ,  why would anyone leave ?
 my current job has met all those criteria ,  some days have to work unpaid overtime too but im not leaving cos pay is decent and if i change job ,  no one can guarantee that i will get the same good co-workers that i have now .
 5k consperm alot of fresh grad will cum snatch
 not everyone  can or willing to handle rough employees .
 in the 1st place why hire rough employees ?
 i think u r better off in employing experienced diploma holder for 3 .
 do u really need uni grad to lead the team ,  if the diploma holder can write basic reports ?
 just a thought .
 is it the supervisor didnt treat him well ?
 now they good business ?
 seems that many people keep borrowing these days
 oh chiu bet it is !
 good business huh ?
 my block oso got someone borrowing money .
 got lady in hot pants accompanied by 2 hunky bodyguards with tattoos every sunday morning .
 all 3 wearing staki lanyard with photocard and carry files .
 if the debtor chao kuan and mai pay up ,  they oso llst right ?
 not like they can hoot the guy or hang pig head
 those agency got work on weekends one meh ?
 the debtor confirm feel xiasuay one please !
 so much noise and the neighbor confirm wondering why
 maybe u see wrongly .
 those guys are her pimp
 the hunky bodyguard got wear jacket behind saying big big  &apos;debt collection in progress .
 not just about borrowing money leh .
 business buy goods oredi dont want to pay up .
 or car/reno companies take money never deliver , etc .
 lots of people need to use debt recovery services .
 chiu win court case and court awards chiu the money .
 if the other party dont pay ,  chiu still need to engage your own either lawyer or debt recovery to get the money .
 they are notwhatyouthink
 huh ,  like this got use meh .
 they go over and talk oni .
 the debtor can just say a few words and then ignore them right ?
 where got incentive for debtor to pay anything .
 the creditor now waste even more money as need to pay fees for debt collector also
 look like bouncers kor kor
 i saw a rooster
 yes debtor can ignore them .
 but they will just keep looking for debtor non stop lor .
 go house find ,  go workplace find .
 it does seem most of the time ,  they are on ,  no collection no pay .
 so they take a % of what they manage to collect .
 most of the time the creditor is no more moves left ,  then go look for debt collector .
 if chiu follow priority list of payment by liquidator ,  all the small suppliers practically no chance of getting any share of the money .
 cos the list prioritises the big boys ,  liquidator first ,  then the banks and landlords ,  utilities ,  then anything left then will go the suppliers .
 basically the priority is skewed towards the big boys .
 those that can take the hits are given money first ironically .
 those that cannot take the hit are taking the biggest hits .
 and chiu wonder why they are unwilling to wait for liquidators to come in .
 some people would give in to pressure cos they have no where else to move to .
 just need to look tough and flex muscle nia .
 i bet they cant handle garie .
 she got 1 very nice cny song .
 some u use jap bento box but the quality is cannot
 if chiu rich af chiu prefer jiu hu bu or jpmm ?
 i think real jap bento is v diff from what we have in singapore which is localized .
 alot of time we buy are piping hot .
 in jap bento r cold ,  most people oso dont heat up ,  just eat it liddat and they oso eat v little compared to us .
 last time i was really excited to go jap eat their bento ,  must say look is v nice but we are more used to our cai png style of warm ,  strong smelling food .
 atb more supply and higher mileage whereas nippon-bu more kc .
 is about the journey ,  not just the destination .
 these are disgusting ,  some of them can really cheapen the food by cutting corners and serving crap .
 ingredients not fresh ,  deep fried dripping in old oil ,  some diluted curry with round grains thats not even japanese rice and they think they can call that japanese food .
 i miss the bentos chiu get in taiwan at the train stations .
 cheap and good ,  and the quality is quite high too ,  for the cheap price .
 no is more like piak a jiuhu bu vs jippun bu .
 jiuhu bu is no fuss integrated experience from massage to piak .
 jippun bu ,  got menu one .
 chiu must pick before hand which to experience and they do 1 by 1 .
 obviously chiu neber go soapland in shinjuku before .
 not expert but think more original jp food often is more than just the food itself bah .
 the pricing tend goes into the presentation ,  ingredients ,  and brand perhaps .
 food court bento is scam .
 especially those sell both ‘japanese’ and ‘korean’ .
 just fried food and sauce .
 jap bento make u light but oni wallet wise .
 got woo before ?
 they would divorce very soon so chiu should be happy about it .
 have dated broken/damaged girls ,  pua sianz when chiu find the wrong type of girls ,  all the guai guai ones all hide at home ,  than those loves to seek validation all running around

 i am 32 years old bbfa - i never had a gf before ,  super dry season for me ,  i am sahara desert liao .
 trust me ,  chiu got to be brave ,  most importantly ,  chiu got to care enough to find a gf .
 chiu dont want to end up a loser like me .
 32 year old ,  no wet hole ,  stay home eat polo .
 chiu go out there right now ,  see chio bu ,  hoot ,  use mouth not use hands ar .
 get reject a hundred time ,  get reject enough chiu will get a gf eventually .
 why are chiu comparing yourself with other people ?
 chiu all have diff personality ,  character ,  family upbringing ,  values ,  mindset .
 23 nia complain no gf
 u try dating apps bah .
 is still got good girl if u dont set expectations too high .
 need some time to find .
 in life ,  there is oni 1 true love .
 have…3 in total .
 one was a gold digger…to the point that it was my friend who made me see what i have become (basically an unlimited at the moment for her) ,  one was cos i didn’t confess and she went for my friend and third the girl got bored 
 i am a 26 yo bbfa ok
 i tried tantan ,  okcupid ,  tinder ,  cmb… .
 got tired of it and very few matches 
 this is so true ,  ah gui biggest regret is never chase girls hard enough while in school
 heng moi know love is but an illusion .
 23 oni kaopeh so much for f ?
 gahment thinks chiu still have 12 more years before expiry .
 why didnt u confess    .
 sometimes just need to have the guts to say how u feel  
 continue to try better than giving up ,  giving up is totally no chance .
 since u wan a relationship .
 u wols liao ,  some coffee shop up the prices of their drinks late last year  .
 our usual coffee and tea from $2 .
 portion oso smaller liao
 nowadays i decide to eat sandwich from petrol kiosk .
 boycott hawker food
 the hot mike problem la .
 maybe vb saying: ri is a good school  .
 at the same time ,  lw saying: my nasi lemak just now damn lousy .
 so happen the mike capture the words: lousy and school consecutively la ,  so sounds like lousy school
 why did the speaker of parleenent not get to the bottom of it ?
 identify all that was in the conversation besides ms vivian ?
 cant be ms vivian uttering it to mr vivian right ?
 if do ,  need to send him to imh for checkup .
 since the remarks were made in parleement ,  should apologise in parleement .
 mic was on and recorded ,  considered as part of parleement speech .
 im dead sure if the remark was made by opposition mps ,  confirmed all in it will be identified .
 sure big case till they cannot get away with just a simple apology .
 vivian admitted his portion of remarks with lmw as the latter posted on his fb and at same time queried who said the rest .
 tsl oni quipped his monk &apos;s hill portion .
 chiu say lei , no need to think so hard .
 if vivian said everything he would have further clarified with lmw and lmw would have provided an update .
 he took a deep breath before turning his head .
 looks like can see a bit of mouth movement as the words spoken but video too pixelated to confirm .
 based on his personality as seen on tv and other social media , there is no telling such remarks cannot be associated with him just yesterday he labelled the 2 psp ncmp as  .
 come ge 2025 the video/audio clip will come back to haunt him .
 he is free to say what he likes and deny everything 
 bro ,  diam diam no admit is one thing… .
 but now is go next level double down to make fb post black and white on leecord to say not him leh… .
 just like covid no horsepeter beds never mind .
 but steel no cb or ha to break transmission and double open up for fts to fly in fly out to worsen the problem…
 pretty obvious they have discussed and one should take one for the team .
 the most dispensible .
 he very confident no one can find out who the other person is ?
 speaker of parliament just sweep under the carpet liao although the public has the interest to confirm whether it was vb talking to himself since lw denied .
 if lmw made the illiterate remark ,  we can imagine he being asked for evidence of illiteracy  ,  then he oso need to apologize to ri ,  get big persecution liao .
 clown chun sing sit so far away from rest of the leeders means what ?
 not me ,  not chiu ,  not him .
 then must be ghost .
 yah vivian ownself talk to ownself in parliament is really sth wrong leh .
 he so stress huh ?
 if at home or alone still can understand .
 alot of people try to process thoughts and talk to oneself .
 but in parliament ?
 i never believed lawrence wong said lousy school .
 those who wronged him should apologise
 monk &apos;s hill confiirm is tsl .
 but 1st and 2nd sounds like vb to me .
 rhetorically ,  1st and 2nd possible to be said consecutively  .
 if lw said he is not the one ,  then most likely to be vb .
 if this is the case ,  why cant vb just admit that he is the one since he oredi apologize .
 the lack of clarification makes it natural for people to guess and take sides .
 it is really unfair to lw if he is not the one .
 the speaker should oso raise this matter up to stop another embarrassing episode from happening in future .
 we need world class debates in parliament ,  not coffee shop talks .
 everyone has to watch what he or she speaks/behaiour in parliament ,  be it mike on or not .
 this is the minimum expectation of any representation of the electorate .
 cannot be vivi senile ownself ask question ownself leeply ownself de… .
 these people oso assured sinkies that we are their priority at every election .
 assurance is a feeling ,  not a fact .
 knn need to subscribe 154 to read the article  .

 hi captain durians am offering foc durian testing !
 oh by the way ltc food taster here haha
 airline captains leh .
 this is just their past time business to get together and mingle with milfs and zhabors while waiting for sky reopening .
 i bet their management are hardly affected .
 work horse always suffer .
 if they know someone who knows someone ,  then it &apos;s easy to get in durian directly from plantation owners  .
 durain profit ard 50% prob more huat than flying once they secure enough customers .
 earn more and more time on the ground with family .
 my friend is sia pilot ,  still receiving most of his basic pay despite not working much for more than a year
 not going to support buy from them .
 they must be malaysian lor and have plantation back in their malaisia
 they are smarter than those useless ones who work as social distancing ambassador  .
 sell durian can earn gao gao like aeroplane captains .

 why specifically oni little bush time leh ?
 but i dont think this is possible within the next 100 years or more .
 the chinese in singapore are oso not the same as those from malaysia or taiwan .
 chiu tried speaking engrish to an educated malaysian chinese before ?
 can vomit blood .
 people from china
 yeah ,  we are definitely different due to our nationalities .
 that pretty much changes our upbringing and beliefs .
 when i see malaysian chinese ,  i would ask if they studied in a chinese medium school or bm medium school .
 they can be very different in their world views .
 after covid most normal way of economics and industrial practices will go out of the window .
 that ,  is a fact we all cannot deny ,  wfh oredi happened ,  office space will no longer be as valuable .
 robotics revolution coming right up (drone food delivery / automated grab services anyone ?
 i can count at least 5 definitely came in to real life
 yes alien is coming to setup new world order .
 used to be a fan of hulk hogan when i was young ,  until john cena came into the scene .
 so ,  no to nwo .
 looking forward to this
 cheena is just a strawman .
 the powers to be control the whole world including nk and iran .
 satan rules this world .
 be in this world but not of this world .
 life will be very tough but there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of once chiu know the truth .
 maybe but people who go full yolo and borrow money usually oso very thick skin one ,  they might just insist on not returning
 those dc will do anything to disrupt your life .
 even chiu thick skin ,  chiu still need a job .
 chiu can don’t return $$ ,  but chiu still need $$ to live by .
 thats alot of work for the dc without a guaranteed payout ,  oso debtor can wfh ,  do other own business or even go overseas .
 not practical to hire dc to claw back tiny amount of money
 just need to apply for anti harassment protection order ,  these bengs cannot even come near u .
 well ,  that’s what they do for living .
 my customer just go to court  ,  pay couple of dollar ,  get a anti harassment order ,  no one can go near him .
 why the creditor cannot go down personally to chase himself ,  he got the right as well right ?
 if debtor don’t pay call police ,  get police report turn it into a civil case .
 i think these dc can be a nuisance ,  especially those innocent neighbours and bystanders oso kena harress .
 hdb i see many of these type of cases .
 can’t hide anymore
 owe money dont want pay the people will feel xiasuay de meh
 no one or that specific debt collection agency ?
 liddat  can always engage other agency
 should change to other names like account recovery team .
  cut the curry pork hair wear tight fit office clothes ma
 quite lousy tbh .
 those chaps don’t even have full sleeves tattoos .
 liddat go collect cash ,  who will return  ?
 if it’s me ,  i would just whack those mofos up .
 ask his edmw name
 got higher pay still waiting for what ?
 of course jump la .
 now chiu really think got loyalty to company one meh ?
 fresh grad maybe tried to suggest an improved routine using iot ,  some it controls then the lao jiao dunno north south east west and rejected .
 how to lead a team liddat in the future ?
 the company wasted so many months of salary keeping these low productivity workers .
 aiya ,  might as well go to another company that is more progressive .
 this is s real case i recently encountered in some training settings .
 a lao jiao line manager (mechanical ,  process) jjww .
 1st week cher tried to teach some cad and he was struggling .
 tried to be a good classmate and wanted to help him ,  from cad to do he dont understand ,  reduce level teach him what is points ,  edge ,  line ,  dont understand ,  okie ,  reduce level teach him how to create a folder to store his cad files ,  dont even know how to create a new folder .
 wa pianz ,  asked him er he do process ?
 oh ,  he knows excel ,  everyday manage cnc ,  milling ,  etc proessing jobs and production control .
 so how chiu do one ?
 er ,  everyday got printout of excel timesheet ,  he takes hardcopy ,  qty 3 ,  go f the technican make qty 3 ,  end of day tick checkbox .
 qty 5 oni get 4 ?
 nabe liddat technical manager ?
 some of our seniors really it challenge ,  cannot catch up with the moving industries liao or scared to change .
 my company just hired new ft for 4500 ,  what chiu offering
 5k of cos run road la
 cut him some slack .
 he may not have the character to handle and manage a team .
 some people are more suited in handling work alone by himself .
 and he may not be a hands on guy in the 1st place .
 i am in a similar position as your engineer .
 firstly to have a fresh grad with little experience to lead a team few months after on the job training is asking too much .
 he is thinking ahead to the day he has to take over the job of the supervisor .
 this is the problem with singapore engineering scene ,  expect too much from engineers and split technical roles into technicians and engineer .
 tbh ,  i find some technicians role are more suited to be paid engineering salary and engineering roles who are leading a team of technicians should be a senior technician like your laojiao supervisor .
 not just purely base on roles and titles .
 youngsters these days prefer jobs that are office bound with aircon .
 they study so hard for degree oredi why bother to toil under sun or harsh conditions daily .
 i am sure there were hundreds of qualified applicants and waiting to take his place .
 dunnid to think so hard to give excuses for a poor hire choice or even attack the quitter .
 just assume they had a better offer and wish them the best .
 fresh graduate ,  zero experience .
 when he was here we were paying for his on the job training .
 sinkies are like dat one .
 due to lesser/zero new engineers from myanmar/phillipines/india recently .
 the available pool of engineers in singapore is hot property .
 if can jump better jump now ,  and can demand higher salary .
 i got one engineer in the company i worked in ,  quit end 2020 .
 then last week i saw him visit ,  driving a brand new smy toyota corolla .
 then he pass me his name card ,  senior technical engineer !
 previously he take the company transport to office .
 after jumping ship ,  now he become better off .
 free internship can ma
 knn why chiu never wonder why this fresh grad will leave your job .
 your side toxic culture and people ,  many ot and lower than industry standard pay isit .
 of course he found better pay of course hop la .
 u offer better pay if u want engineers to sweat under hot sun
 job hop means got job opportunities .
 find others liao
 5k is too low these days le .
 average should be $4k oredi .
 and in case ts didn’t know .
 most fresh grad / uni grads are loaded with money  ,  either from parents or from investing in stocks and crypto .
 so what is that $3 .
 chiu say overpay .
 maybe to the employee is not enough ?
 like semi retirement mode liao .
 everyday 9-6 is just online/ at office to show face .
 those whose jod can wfh longterm one loh .
 which is many of edmw .
 dragonite zeh zeh 
 ds is broadwell small 3 ?
 i just saw her piak piak video a few weeks ago when surfing rodent website  .
 first and oni edmw girl with leaked videos 
 radish sister at ferry terminal going to batam/bintan more chio
 huai until now chocobelle zeh zeh no pics huh ?
 i 2008 member ,  dunno any of these
 last pic is hengbok zz ?
 should show more photos of wd .
 who is t his cute zehzeh !
 this is quite sad .
 its not 2020 version ,  they are all old edmwers .
 most of them long left edmw ,  some even married have children oredi .
 there are no new mm for 2020 .
 all become a mummy liao
 face it ,   good majority of hardwarezone and facebook users are 30s-40s
 any chiobus still here at 2020 ?
 all bbfas here need a chance 
 this chio bu posted yet ?
 wa kan silang chio sial .
 upz your points .
 heavy taste siah .
 but no swimming pool .
 and how chiu renovate ,  your neighbours would still be low ses haha .
 actually ,  most condo residents oso behave low ses   .
 but at least the condo is more instagramable
 i dont do instagram and i dont use the condo facilities (except maybe the gym ,  but then again i go to another gym) .
 i prefer the larger space since thats where i spend most of my time .
  our jobs here is so unattractive to them  ?
  choice to work here can be easily overridden by a mask  ?
 common la when their own country dont even want them
 i thought oni my dad &apos;s generation use yehudi .
 now still many restrictions of course wanna leave lo
 how come people can find job easily but sinkie just cannot get out .
 all refer drv grab here .
 more will come in from south asia
 gahment oredi said we  not enough local talents so need come in more foreign talents .
 so chiu expect us being no talented can find work elsewhere ?
 i sympathesize with the expats .
 in their home countries ,  they can socialise freely ,  go to restaurants and bars in bigger groups ,  and even not wear masks .
 still ,  we cannot lift restrictions and let imported cases go out of control .
 the oni thing to do about the exit of fts is to tap the local workforce .
 he never get invited to the big expat party at clarke quay over new year ?
 maybe feel left out
 cec@ will leplace angmo
 jobs for fts ,  ns for sinkies
 expats are foreigners with no roots and loyalty to this country ?
 who would expect otherwise from them ?
 or chiu are one of those sinkies who bought into the ministerial propaganda of sll fts are playing for team singapore .
 good good ,  1 way ticket right ?
 what &apos;s the correlation here ?
 sorry bit what ?
 moi can oni see big breast 
 26 steel yang   
 yes ,  no one likes u .
 when u die ,  ants will carry your body away .
 on the bright side ,  there will be alot of ants 
 i actually regretted even till today ,  my friend told me she was actually waiting for me to say but then i didn’t  .
 i think after that i became super edgy and as such ,  the third girl got bored of me  .
 girls seems so complex 
 thats what my friend say as well…finding a wrong girl is worse than not having one at all .
 a toxic rs sucks
 leegret ,  what if eternal recurrence ?
  i am bbfa i have no leegret cos i dont give a f*ck since 1989 .
 there is oni like 1 woman so far ,  that made me want to look at her instagram .
 i just dunno how to care about woman at this age .
 what is the ideal age to have gf ?
 bro ,  i oso la ,   what to do .
 no luck means no luck .
 i totally know how u feel
 ts ,  love and marriage is not a race .
 this is something young people like chiu need to learn .
 yes ,  chiu are envious others can buy bto and  &apos;get rich &apos; .
 uncle me is in a gc with 200+ divorced / unhappy people in marriages .
 when chiu have a child and have to live with someone chiu once loved and now hate ,  thats when the nightmare begins .
 take your time .
 love and marriage is to be enjoyed .
 more important to get it right .
 not re-marry 3 times .
 go find a sales job .
 meet many different people .
 do well earn alot of money your syt colleagues oso come to chiu ask chiu for advice
 no need to regret .
 the more times chiu failed .
 the more sianz and jaded chiu get .
 thank chiu sir…i hope i can find the one soon bah .
 i know that a rs is not all roses but then it sucks seeing how loving some of my friends are 
 can ask your friends to intro u laa  .
 if u are someone of a gd character ,  am sure your so-called friends could put a gd word about urself to the gals that they knew of .
 even to intro their gfs &apos;/wives &apos; female friends if need be .
 but gotta ask urself this 1st: whether if u are ready to commit urself in a r/s for a lifetime
 when he 38 the other people chiu referring to become 51 liao
 i oso sian ,  every day thinking maybe i can go bedok reservoir for a swim .
 but i still pressed on brother .
 and look forward to my life and hope that something good happens .
 i know how it feels .
 my friends are mostly guys lo…don’t really have much female friends 
 tnats what i told myself at 20 as well .
 ts what u been through everyone oso experienced same thing .
 everyone oso got experienced before
 the older chiu get .
 the more sianz chiu get .
 and more and more chiu will come to terms with it and chiu will be quite hokz with staying single liao .
 by then they wouldve matured like wine and all the syts begging to be their stead liao
 just deliver the kukujiao will do
 limited to non kukujiao customers only
 i think they need to hire real full-time delivery guys for food delivery ,  with incentive for performance .
 if performance dont meet kpi ,  then fire .
 it sounds better on resume if chiu learn how 160 rephrase it .
  &apos;i do it out of passion .
 fake news ,  everyday see so many grabfood bicycle ,  pmd and bikes running around .
 like pak game liddat .
 complete mission by mission
 did anyone order hkm from opp harbor front ?
 but danger le ,  i see those bicycle and bike ,  anytime tio langa means gg

 50% discount for 2nd kukujiao onwards
 if i bring my friend icecreampop ?
 both of us are dinobus
 ya all other jobs damn easy yo
 im 90kg and my best friend icecreampop is 120kg .
 we can all have a good time together ,  we &apos;re very willing to please .
 best size for 1080p .
 14inch laptop extends with 24inch monitor
 samsung 27 &apos; fhd .
 going to buy a dell 27 &apos; 4k .
 kinda too big for close distance
 perfect for my gaming cod ,  re8 ,  gta ,  battlefield and edmw    .
 how much is that ?
 my class monitor is c cup
 another siaolang shushu 
 won a 32 &apos; samsung smart monitor few months ago from hwz but gave it to my sister 
 lg 49-in ultrawide 5k monitor .
 he &apos;s quite big .
 but we are not into body-shaming .
 a couple of prefects are bigger than him ,  but the assistant ,  a monitress ,  is rather petite .
 find 27inch too big
 sick of people using cheena as the bogeyman .
 cheena even if double or triple their current strength cannot fight the whole world .
 both napoleon and hitler found out the hard way ,  i am sure xi wont make the same mistake .
 the world at 6 billion population closing in on 7 billion should worry about how to keep their mouths fed .
 with climate getting worse every passing year ,  wont be long before we get a famine of epic proportions .
 maybe then a world war might even be a good thing ,  reduce the world population by a third .
 if that dont do it ,  maybe another virus might do the trick .
 no more trump ma
 thats human natural instinct to self regulate .
 find some excuse to kill each other .
 what &apos;s the new world order ?
 who &apos;s the king
 the new world order will be countries losing sovereignty .
 basically there will be no nationalism .
 people will have free movement .
 probably a unified currency too .
 the rich countries will be forced to support the poorer ones .
 basically the eu but  globally .
 and we all saw how successful that is .
 the smaller trial run failed but the geniuses believe if they extended it globally ,  this idea will succeed .
 but who is the overall leader then ?
 faster reset lah
 i just wanna go isekai nia 
 i think globalization has gone amok and affected societies .
  the ordinary joe have realized globalization oni benefits big corporations ,  corrupt governments and the wealthy elite .
  societies have paid the price in terms of economic outsourcing ,  wage depression and uncontrolled immigration waves .
 in the end ,  i hope the oppressed citizens all over the developed world will eventually get fed up and revolt !
  this world really needs a drastic reset to put things back in order .
  even if this results in anarchy ,  violence and destruction ,  it is worth the price to pay to address the corporate greed that has damaged livelihoods ,  distorted trade and polluted environments .
 the conspiracy has been discussed since the old george bush &apos;s times .
 but here ,  the new world order reality is ceca .
 kali projected onto building and shiva at cern might not be simple .
 someone from rome 
 rome is a tool .
 infiltrated and positioned to push for it .
 the leader of the nwo will be from a superpower country .
 possibly the usa or cheena .
 but if its the usa ,  the usa would be nothing like it is today .
 and it &apos;s not someone the people elected .
 is hulk hogan 
 is too big to be united .
 if u do it by force ,  u hurt yourself more .
 human mindset changes  very fast ,  especially if it doesnt benefit them .
 let &apos;s simply ponder upon this point .
 we need the disparity between the rich and the poor to make the world function .
 huai never upload the 4k version to youtube ?
 can do upturn the downturn ?
 cos dont have youtube account .
 anyone ,  please feel free to upload to youtube if chiu have account .
 what is this technology  
 how many of them are still employed in the same position  ?
 have to do free work for chiu  .
 where to buy the album ?
 youtube still processing video ,  now oni can see 360p version .
 but oredi clearer than the original .
 in 4k their faces jin scarlee 
 suddenly the lazada 33 ad is ky lolx
 i realise is sgag pam 
 means a new generation of fans will get to enjoy this epic rap video production in real hd quality liao !
 really is blast from the past .
 these people are farking retarded
 never see anyone talk about this here .
 what printer do chiu use ?
 what do chiu print ?
 cubicon style ,  pla/tpu .
 used to have envisiontec in my lab but decommissioned liao haha .
 bbfas here print customized vags .
 i know an edmwer that has that hobby
 i oni hear 2 voices in that video clip .
 i dont understand why some people insist that there were 3 people talking and lw was one of them .
 liang popo makes wo wo sound u cant tell
 pinky sit so near to them .
 why never come out clarify this issue ?
 he probably hears them every time .
 oni this time the mic was on .
 he probably has been waiting for a long time for someone to ask the question so he can deny making that remark ,  and most importantly ,  tell others involved that he didnt  &apos;gold finger &apos; him/them .
  if i was him ,  i would probably get a stooge to post that question so i can answer it .
 im notch an elite but its too big to coverup moreover miw is not a small company .
 3 pax uncle beer talk oredi so low .
 doubt he can survive whiter than white if he actually said it and double down to deny .
 pluck out one by one .
 tan see leng is from monk &apos;s hill .
 vivian b has admitted he said .
 the 3rd person who said something about how lmw got into ri; must be sitting near the above 2 persons .
 go and  check the video of the telecast debate .
 people say can tell from voice ,  but i cannot .
  maybe i didn’t on loud enough or what .
 but based on 2 things - his body language and his emotional bank account (eba)  ,  my judgement is it’s not him .
  he appeared to be minding his own business as if thinking “this loose cannon viv just leave him alone” ,  and  from personal experience  ,  others tend to leave such loose cannons alone cos they will oso turn on chiu .
  then oni when tan replied with ‘i’m from monk’s hill” ,  did he turn .
 likely cos tan just spoke and he felt what tan had to say could probably be something to note i .
 the earlier viv self talk can be rubbished and i am not going to bother about him .
 now that he has clarified ,  i doubt he will lie cos it would mean to viv and tan that he is willing to lie for such a seemingly trivial matter…though they are in same party ,  they are oso sizing up each other .
 lpp crying liao 
 it seems obvious to me .
 can someone repeat to me the conversation again .
 i want to analyse the content to see if the content and sequence can be spoken by the same person .
 which means he is oso too shrewd to admit .
 of course ,  no discreet minister would have uttered those disrespectful words had he known the mic was recording .
 the emperor has no clothes .
 meaning:​this expression is used to describe a situation in which people are afraid to criticize something or someone cos the perceived wisdom of the masses is that the thing or person is good or important .
 agree ,  among them lw is the oni one to i say well done .
 chiu should reply him on his fb page:  &apos;i knew chiu wouldnt have said such disrespectful words .
 the person who uttered those words and not owning up must have been a hypocrite without integrity !
 yes ,  agree this is not a trivial issue since it involves the integrity of our ministers .
 not easy but anyone can do .
 if u throw in one more slim atb or vietbu ,  im sure will be fun
 middle is kuatiogui zehzeh ?
 anyone remember snali_f or something ?

  i dont remember seeing any chio bus .
 chiu login just to post  ?
  if not ,  i would have 200 , 000 posts by now .
 any new updates for september ?
 bump for chiobus .
 the doctor still the best
 jessie ,  amulet ,  wimms and etc all chio bu .
 simple yes or no
 ownself stupid but blame others are the worst .
 all the notices on their website all about changes to their interest rates and card promotions .
 not even a warning on the scam and phishing .
 personal banking notices  .
 definitely partial blame .
 nobody is faultless in this saga
 imo def got part to play .
 fearful yes ,  stupid no .
 scammers made use of acct holders fear to their advantage .
 and its not like acct holders are responding to get rich quick scams
 no machine learning ai to detect sudden unusual large transfer to foreign entity ?
 what a farking joke .
 at least stop the transfer and get a service staff to manually call lah
 how can let scammer take money out from the account holder ?
 stupid jiu shi stupid simi fearful ?
 both are at faults .
 ocbc could have stopped it earlier .
 mas and banks could have strengthened the security protocols .
 yup thats why i said their fraud department is really cui .
 the scams can go on for days ?
 oni cheat brainless class .
 oredi withdraw everything from the bank .
 user kum gong and ocbc system not robust enough .
 should have triggered something on their end
 go for the strongest bank .
 one question do the banks hold physical cash ?
 example if their total internet banking account is 1 trillion ,  everyday large volume of physical cash is transfer globally ?
 still not able to trace where the money gone to ?
 all disappeared after transferred out ?
 all go hor-lan liao .
 criminal can go there and will never be extradicted
 i though should be all ocbc fault ?
 im shocked people here can blame the victims .
 scammer trf the money without otp notification triggered is their fault ?
 just hope your aged relatives dont fall victim cause chiu would be singing a diff tune then
 hope more follow in his footsteps
 i dont mind being a hotel if thats the business model .
 sinkies provide the services ,  manage and run the hotel business on our own ,  draw good management salaries and pick up valuable high level management skills .
 but problem is all the high management jobs ,  good salary jobs and international business skills are given to foreigners while sinkies ,  even very qualified and educated ones are relegated to being chambermaids to serve fts in their own  country .
 thank chiu byebye
 why are we sinkies ,  highly educated and qualified in our country be second class residents to fts hiring manager who hire and give out good jobs and opportunities among themselves within the fts expats networks ?
 why pm lee like to put fts on a pedestal while vilifying and condemning our our sinkies .
 if running under the hot sun and humid rain for 8 to 10 hours a days doing physical manual labour to run around to deliver food and groceries to fts working from home in their nice cushy condo is not proof of sinkies being able to take hardship and picky about jobs ,  i dunno what is .
 it’s actually easier to find job there now ,  they experiencing the “great resignation” need as much talent and workers as they can get their hands on atm
 this is why i dont trust government-controlled media .
 dont understand  .
 they run away for the most minor of issues .
 so what &apos;s the big deal with them leaving ?
 c guys will come take their place .
 good riddance to the leechers and spandex warriors .
 they oredi know the issue thats why trying to cheat on the case number to justify they can open further .
 yes thats right .
 singapore will end up like monaco  .
 in monaco being a millionaire is like someone staying in condominium in singapore .
  it &apos;s just middle class  .
 they have tons of multi millionaires & billionaires  .
 and its the french residents who stay there who serve them .
 so an entire economy is created to serve the rich  .
 except in singapore ,   sinkies serve third world indians
 and stuck in endless infection of covid all variants ,  unfortunately; there is a good reason for mask wearing and social distancing  .
 and she can oso bet her last dollar going down the road for many years to come ,  all major insurers are going to push every little medical problem she has to be vaccine related thus not claimable  .
 very simple ,  pak zham or not ,  as long chiu dont want to get covid any variant ,  chiu will need to mask up ,  raw is war .
 for those who buy into covid is just a flu ,  omicron is even less than a flu thing ,  good luck
 give lame excuses  .
 amurica so many job openings now .
 i received many email enquiries from head hunters n recruiters there
 cheaper better faster .
 most sinkies are peasants nia ,  who cares if they live true to their peasant nature by working as serfs ?
 and they voted in the same way ,  the first floodgates with the largest tsunami wave was carried out by the father .
 what stop u being a ft in other countries ?
 common occurrence acty ,  nthn &apos; to be surprised or peeved at .
 once hired ,  dont put any high hopes that the person will stay for a long time .
 for whatever reason/s that he/she wanna leave ,  so be it  .
 up to that person anw
 it’s very funny these days that corporates think their $3 .
 5k or $4k worth alot and youngsters are willing to slave their life for that amount .
 it’s an internet world where money is no longer earn from slogging their lives .
 previous in my post oredi said sinkies are strawberries liao .
 no 5k said celery low ,  no training provided say no carreer development .
 now u see training provided liao wanna say what ?
 chao sinkie deserve to do food deliver and driver la .
 u jas look for foreigners .
 they more driven and positive altittude .
 dont waste your time .
 chiu can find foreigner then say .
 now i heard alot of their work permits keep getting rejected .
 got coys apply three times reject thrice  .
 there are plenty of ah-bu-neh-neh and pinoy applying .
 my boss asked if we should cast our nets to overseas engineers .
 fresh grad from universiti teknologi malaysia come here can get 4 .
 good luck with your offer .
 remember what some minister said ,  one day sinkies will be ft in other countries or something liddat .
 what are the future job prospects in your company ?
 or will be stagnated after sometime ?
 propsperous free market economy .
  chiu can always fire anyone ,   and anyone can oso fire chiu .
 if  equilibirum is achieved ,  then both parties will engage in an agreement lor .
 obviously the junior didnt feel the equilibirum  ,  no matter what chiu think/say about him is irrelevant .
 the oni way to have real sinkies willing to take anything is when the whole economy tanks and sh*t hits the fan .
 by then ,  even $2k everybody will be fighting for the job to serve chiu .
 solution - pay higher / learn how to motivate youngsters / wait for economy to tank / hire ft  (choose one !
 end of the day its just to keep depressing wages of enginners and yet expect alot of responsibilities from grads .
 keep it up go ahead and employ your third world engineers just cos they are willing to work harder for that pathetic 3 .
 5k salary which u think is high in todays cost of living .
 the fresh grad just have to throw all responsibility to the technician can oredi .
 have chiu see fresh grad lead a team on first day ?
 ts ,  are chiu saying sinkie buay gan ?
 maybe here &apos;s the problem .
 how many field teams and how many tos chiu have ?
 in management training ,  we were advised to send management trainees to different teams for ojt training/orientation .
 that is if a trainee is primed to manage team a ,  he is sent to team b for his ojt .
 indeed ,  there are numerous benefits in this practice .
 a luxury chiu may not have if the outfit is small .
 how much did your company paid him as a fresh grad ?
 mnc or  sme company  ?
 how many % of his time in non air con environment  ?
 ts working in bedok ?
 this is a fresh graduate position and we have based our salaries on the median salaries of local university graduates .
 underpaying people again .
 ok go back to your cheap nehs la .
 low ses sme towkays
 his position is the traineeship program ar ?
 no wonder jump ship .
 he just found a job as construction worker .
 can merge with earlier threads
 this together with the west coast market are not part of the cluster reported .
 toa payoh lorong 8 market was reported after 2 days instead of instantly .

 it &apos;s mda &apos;s fault if we cannot watch online gay sex
 classic epic self pwn of the pap civil serpents
 not sure if this movie is still copyrighted material .
 guess chiu can do it yourself .
 buy the app or go climb mountain .
 i still remember this  got superman stand on roof .
 the other nonsense song was yog oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
 sinkie budget in deficit to fund these jokers ?
 samsung smart tv &apos;s youtube search shows 4k icon for this video but still cannot select 4k playback .
 wonder why its taking so long for youtube to process 4k .
 if they do an updated version ,  probably more than half of the rappers are ceca .
 guess why mda has been renamed as imda now .
 youtube can 4k playback liao
 mai hiam not bad la .
 the egg not nice the rest ky
 singapore fish files: ikan kurau ,  threadfin ,  ngoh her - ieatishootipost .

 tcj seem one of the trust worthy one .
 both tio fixed by u-noe- who
 yes ,  it was indeed speaker of parl tan chuan-jin eating bak kut teh with wp chief low thia khiang .
 we could use more of this cohesion in singapore .
 this is very true .
 colleague is colleague .
 this was before or after his speaker appointment ?
 good to know tcj was neutral on the cop .
 i still feel that cop members should not be a ruling mps .
 the essence of this pikcher is the food .
 must have been expensive .
 papship loves this thread  .
 i guess we wont see et doing that with ps
 politics - in front smiling ,  back stabbing ?
 i dont want to keep jabbing .
 pfizer still no 3rd trial data like sinovac ?
 the common flu vaccine is like every few years need to reconnect if chiu travelling to their world dirty countries .
 those vaccinated will be guinea pigs .
 they are still new .
 thus no one can answer
 chiu will be jabbed anyway .
 they oredi said liao ,  covid is here to stay every year will refresh .
 if suay ,  3 days later got newer version making every single vaccine in the world useless .
 then back to square one .
 every year inject updated code
 liddat take traditional vaccines like j&j safer mah .
 half dead virus ,  body immune system can handle ,  new technology vaccines nobody knows
 flu vaccine is yearly leh .
 how come yours every few years ?
 even they is tell chiu few years .
 few months or a year later simidouble mutant variant come out liao .
 but gahment wants u to jab jab .
 otherwise how to open border quick quick ?
 edmwers said no to vaccine .
 means chiu jab early chiu lugi
 chiu will be protected until chiu get infected with covid and fall sick 
 my safety manager says it should be a 1 year thing .
 27 inch monitor
 that dell rotatable matt screen one .
 old monitor but i love it

 anything bigger for 1080p blurry imo  .
 need to go for 1440p at least for 24 &apos; .
 14inch laptop extend to 32inch monitor .
 plus 15inch laptop to surf edmw .
 go back office feel 2 x 17inch weird and graphics cmi
 just changed from cx48 to prism x340  .
 is monitor worth it ?
 for reading long text .
 same like on a tablet .
 portrait is better to read long passages than landscape .
 chiu set 2 display side by side with your laptop .
 drag those content over to the monitor to read
 48 &apos; tv as monitor
 wow are such monitor expensive ?
 i remember about $240 niah .
 bought dell direct .
  but this is not for playing games or photoshop quality works .
 for extra screen real estate for reading .
 and my eyes more comfy with these matt screen .
 these are very common in offices .
 one 27 &apos; and one 24 &apos; vertical
 3x27 on fixed stand and 2x24 on ergotron arm
 27 &apos; but going to downgrade to 24 &apos; new imac in purple !
 must be cia blackhand trying to make caina orlumpig failure !
 their country too big and too many people .
 they got no choice .
 once it becomes too jialat .
 by then it will be a case of massive infection and death .
 once they report liddat mean sibei jialat liew .
 heng vtl postpone
 i live in xi &apos;an for a year before .
  super crowded place .
 the high population there  cos of numerous huge universities .
 rai liao rai rlao
 ngl ,  last time when go cp play play .
 chose a cbb lookalike ,  but with boobs .
 that night was rocking .
 lila wanna pump them allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
 chiu want them but they dont want chiu reh 
 i thought got the eggtoast .
 chiobus can apply different rules la 
 remembering chio bu of pass amulet jiejie .
 her last post in 2015 and last activity in apr 2019 .
 where is the xiong ?
 are these real edmwer bus ?
 nobody can take over your throne .
 sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction .
 i got the same picture on hdd with this name .
 though really dunno who is it .
 google  &apos;edmw amulet &apos; the first picture lor .
 wearing white bikini .
 but that was very long ago .
 now i think chiu can wait for few more years for her daughter .
 busy with family life la .
 she got a young son to take care of in addition to her teenage daughter .
 mr wong said the recent increase in the number of cases is not unexpected ,  since more people have been going out following the loosening of restrictions earlier ,  .
 but singapore is oso in a new phase ,  with a high level of vaccine coverage ,  he added .
 as the gahment continues to monitor the situation ,  it will oso expand the nation &apos;s vaccination and testing regime .
 mr ong said about 85 per cent of the population would have been fully vaccinated against covid by this month .
 added mr wong:  &apos;we have oredi reached very high levels of vaccination - we are one of the foremost countries in terms of vaccination - we should now aspire to be a nation of testing ,  where testing becomes a way of life .
 all he cares about is his vaccine kpi !
 eh fug off la ,  i dont want to poke nostril everyday .
 ask him to poke his own backsai everyday luh .
 economic growth at all costs  .
 new citizens votes at all costs  .
 holy prince to become king at all costs
 i guess he oso doesn’t know what else to do liao  .
 the incompetence of the task force is allowing the virus to run amok in sinkieland community
 small eye jinx lousy la  
 it is tied to his performance bonus .
 should be order from the top .
 the death and infection are inevitable what  ?
 and the unlinked cases is sinkie fault .
 he oredi worked on the booster shot schedule .
 what more do chiu want him to do  ?
 do a booster dance like what jc did  ?
 strict border control is the key ,  with mu variant that can make vaccine useless ,  even 100% vaccinated oso no use
 can they look at israel  ?
 high vaxx rate but their cases spiking like no tomorrow  !
 nation of testing means alot of people tio and kena quarantine .
 really is ccbpap
 oyk is right ,  his focus is now on vaccinations rate and not number of cases .
 oni kumgong edmwer still so concern with daily case count   .
 tsl oredi said once hit 90% all can forget wfh and go back opi liao  ,  huat ah !
 siao the test fking painful ,  ask us test so often ?
 just go back to social distancing la force people work from office for fk
 this aljunied loser &apos;s performance bonus is pegged to vaccination rate is it ?
 i think he would have learnt from the last time he openly mentioned that hdb flats are depreciating assets .
 means he &apos;s the oni one from that  &apos;must be a lousy school &apos; loh .
 bro ,  their assurance worth how much huh ?
 i can buy assure masks three boxes for $20 leh .
 bro ,  why he no dare admit huh ?
 damn surprised that he would deny .
 bros ,  so many people and even vocie recorder software consperm it was lau lan wong &apos;s voice liao .
 if he low profile never hog limelight give speeches every week ,  at least maybe no people can recognize his voice .
 but every week in on teebee taking the mic ,  how not to recognize his distinct nasal voice wor ?
 lw probably wishing people will forget about this .
 leaders without integrity is a big no no .
 bros ,  not him meh ?
 why leeporter leeport he got share in the convo huh ?
 bros ,  not admitting that he said  &apos;must be a lousy school &apos; isit considered lying in parleement huh ?
 oni 2 voices were heard la .
 vivian & monks hill .
 where got lw voice .
 chiu guys stop imagining things just cos rk was caught by spf for lying .
 dunno but irrelevant banter and lying when making a statement in parliament 3times is very different
 bro ,  banter is one thing mah .
 but cummed out dare dare open eye say blind words to deny when question is integrity problem leh .
 order from the top ?
 more like all his kawan ask him bah ,  gdp is part of the consideration of their bonus structure .
 this ambitious arse hole needs to be sacked .
 more vax ,  more bonus .
 any more suggestions for noteworthy videos to upscale ?
 must not be copyrighted materials like movies or record label music or youtube creator contents .
 just dont be creepy .
 wait ,  hope and failed efforts as well 
 ask yourself what chiu can do now to enhance your chances and hopefully change the current situation .
 not regret ten years later for not doing anything .
 23 year old nia kpkb really is loser .
 chiu oreadi gotch a welly good advantage of 1 .
 just lose the weight and chiu will have lots of girls flocking towards chiu liao .
 and huai the weird decision to study masters in tiongland ?
 we must have more and more join our bbfa crub !
 i legit pinning all my hopes on cheena oredi .
 i will be spending 2yrs there to do my masters…hopefully can meet someone ;(
 i am going to bed now and be emo .
 u oni 23 and going to cheena .
 u know cheena got how many chiobus !
 when u are at 26 ,  then come and kpkb , jjww ok
 knn 26 oni me 32 how   
 from what i observed ,  people who marry young divorce faster .
 they are mentally unprepared for the challenges of marriage .
 i reckon the correct age for sinkies to marry is about 30 .
 then there is enough maturity to handle quarrels .
 i was married at 30 .
 now married 20 years .
 enjoy your single life .
 once married ,  there is no turning back .
 maybe this is a good time for chiu to learn how to date .
 yes ,  there are some learning to it .
 what seems to be the problem ?
 too shy to ask a girl out ?
 good night to chiu and for your kind words…but cheena girls expectation oso quite high 
 i was lucky enough to get into peking university .
 so decided to go for it but due to the pandemic ,  cheena have restricted border access so bo bian have to delay my studies by a year .
 i trying to slim down a bit to maybe sub-100kg before my studies next year september
 i want your height  
 i oredi in the club le ah 
 one of us one of us one of us
 huai lucky enuff ?
 just get into local uni masters better .
 count yourself lucky .
 tour the world without worries .
 just get some companion there or go with friends .
 own time own target .
  u oso will sian if your wife is a b .
 and totally not on the same wavelength as chiu .
 then cannot divorce cos chiu want your kids to grow up emotionally healthy
 not really good sia ,  i sit double decker bus the upper deck have to bend down…take mrt too .
 the bank security suck to have this kind of thing to happen .
 these incidents show how poor the management is given how dead silent they are .
 no afford at all when it comes to pr .
 i personally ignore all sms and emails from banks .
 if it’s that impt ,  call me biatch !
 but i oso acknowledge that not everyone is as bochup as me .
 and it’s unacceptable for the scammers to transfer all money by using one otp
 the victims tio scammed cos they give out the user name and password so partial blame .
 but ocbc processes is flawed .
 how come it is so easy for the scammers to increase the transfer limits ,  add new payees and new accounts so easily ?
 ocbc should make it robust such that it can sustain damage from usual password leak .
 thats what 2fa should do .
 and the fact itsnt ,  ocbc at fault
 both has fault .
 this looks legit ?
 everyone needs to make the effort
 yes ,  they are partly to blame .
 this incident is not an isolated case ,  it happened to other banks but the fallout on ocbc appears to be more severe .
 ocbc did not act fast enough ,  and failed to block the phishing sites in time .
 why should chiu bank with a bank with lackluster security ?
 there have been reminders given oredi but there will still be some people who will fall for such scams no matter what .
 this could happen to any company ,  not oni the banks .
 it is a very unfortunate lesson learnt for those affected .
 partially responsible bah .
 need to see investigation report .
 nbccb yes yes yes !
 in the past ,  otp was never implemented ,  the user oni require an id and a six digit passcode .
 there were news that some posb accounts were hacked simply cos the passcode was easily guessed from their birthdate ,  ic etc .
 this is the reason why otp is implemented ,  yet such scams and hacks till occurred to this day .
 slow work process .
 not enough safeguards
 one day u give your house keys to a guy unknowingly .
 that guy then wants to enter your condo .
 the condo security should stop that person and verify his id before letting him in .
 that guy has the access card .
 go by side gate  .
 which security guard company the condo use ?
 their security guards are so well trained to recognize all the residents there   now all wearing masks too .
 those who think is ocbc fault are the victims  .
 those who think is the victims fault are bbfa edmwers
 with great power comes great responsibility .
 banks have been giving customers more and more power to handle their own account .
 some people are not risk averse ,  too hack care or clueless on what all the trade off for these conveniences .
 ask him to provide data to support what he said .
 can liddat say one meh .
 not like we paying $$$ .
 until covid mutate .
 this is the way .
 cannot be forever .
 even flu jab oso need to frequently
 it was like a rough gauge by him .
 better chiu dunno .
 else chiu will open another thread jinx the validity of the vaccine .
 my guess is 2 years
 until the dominant strain change to another type
 still oni really respect one general .
 winston choo 1st one .
 iirc he refused to take up a glc job offered to him
 first full minister to be demoted .
 he demoted meh ?
 thats lg ng jui peng .
 the cdf after winston  .
 winston choo - wikipedia .
 it &apos;s ng jui ping ,  but he oso became chairman or director of some glcs/stat boards .
 ng jui ping - wikipedia .
 the one after him  .
 winston choo went on to work for chartered industries ,  now should be some st coy immediately after retirement .
 heir to the throne .
 ah thanks for correcting me !
 just ask who has war experience will do .
 all paper generals with no war experience - how to compare sia ?
 who lost more lives during peacetime or who lost more taxpayers money during post army career lol ?
 step down when cmi
 significant positive impact on singapore ?
 drive companies to their grave counted ?
 negative impact oso impact wor .
 but ccs say generals are understanding ,  motivating and won the confidence of sinkies from all walks of life .
 surely there must be anecdotes of it ?
 paper warrios nia
 purposely speed up when i signal to change lane  .
 depends on how far ahead u are  .
 if neck and neck speed up nothing wrong
 please dont jump queue  .
 when people are queuing .
 will chiu let a guy who wave and signal at chiu to jump queue in front of chiu ?
 at least 10 metre away
 nice guys finish last
 signal light not enough la .
 u must position the car to signal your intent oso ma
 sinkie drivers got ego problem one
 yes i experienced the same too .
 chiu signal your intentions early and they take advantage of the situation .
 they speeds up so chiu can goes behind them .
 i more dulan those when i signals liao ,  they keep paces with me ,  and in front of my got one car just like to cruising there .
 liddat lagi kena stuck .
 at least if the car on my next lanes speeds up ,  i can fasterly zips out mah .
 literally if chiu go see ,  every ministries almost all got create new post hire new staffs .
 huh liddat means current civil servants more relak as got extra manpower .
 whereas in private is cut staffs .
 there are more than 100 , 000 sinkie who are in working age now unemployed .
 according to leong data .
 if they dont do something or massage the figures .
 it will be terrible if they are required to present some data of some sorts .
 but if these people go into the work force ,  they will be under paid for the current cost of living expected  , ( better than no pay) and they would waste their best working yrs of their lives away .
 this is the reality the younger cohort of people will face .
 no saving ,  might not be able to finish paying for their hdb if they own one by 55 ,  no min sum to satisfy  , no chance to enjoy their twlight years .
 owning 2 or more properties for sinkie .
 is but a wet dream .
 better than no job mah .
 how much chiu pay him ?
 maybe he join the safe entry ambassador ,  aircon and beo xmm .
 ah ,  singapore employers ,  the oni people who can look at reality and say  &apos;no way ,  this cant be true &apos; .
 works in close relationship with our newspaper .
 his first job ,  $3 .
 5k for fresh ,  wet nose graduate who needs training ?
 means he see u and your coy bo standard la .
 ownself buey gan don’t call others buey gan .
 if u so good why he quit ?
 maybe knows the grad going to be his direct supervisor he not happie so secretly tekan him till he leave then maybe u all will promote him instead ?
 he do not have chance .
 cos he is not trained in reading plans and calculations to deal with designers of refrigeration system .
 i remember 10+ years ago when i grad ,  engineer starting pay was 3 .
 how dafuq isit still the same now ?
 even ft fresh grad in moi company get at least 4k
 why dont u all send him for training or he refused to be trained ?
 what is the difference ?
 actually doesn’t mean that he next time become team leader the lao jiao sup don’t dare to scold him or be rough with him .
 the laojiao has oredi know all the workers and got many years of knowledge ,  this new jiao still need his advise and listen to him most of the time .
 tell boss and pm of red dot  to raise engineer pay by another 3k
 as a hiring manager ,  i &apos;d believe and take heed from this as much as i believe the  &apos;experts &apos; on 160th
 why generalise based on the decision of a single fresh grad ?
 maybe he just wants a year to yolo or even take a graduate course .
 5k offer is market viable ,  there will be no shortage of applicants .
 he found a better offer mah .
 nowadays doesn’t pay to be loyal liao…
 all my friends refer to 160 reports when offering salaries .
 my company has no problem paying 3 .
 since he was undergoing on the job training ,  3 .
 5k was about right .
 thereafter we would increase to 3 .
 8k or even 4k after probation depending on his performance .
 how were his hours  ?
 i saw chiu wrote 5 day week but how about working hours and any ot  ?
 chiu don’t eat skin ?
 is it black pomfret ?
 walan so many give bu ky lol
 home cooked always best la that’s for sure 
 singapore fish files: pomfrets and pompanos - ieatishootipost .
 i got eat is separated out
 colour a bit dull .
 u want better relations at home ,  try to eat together at the dining table
 have fish is not simple liao .
 see when is father day .
 maybe moi family prepared home cooked crabs .
 ps kill live crabs  ,  hope gods can forgive me
 i everyday jiak fish though
 i eating at dining table lmao
 is meant to be dull one .
 is fried de leh bro
  &apos;even though our jobs were good ,  it was oso very stressful and very demanding ,  &apos; said santos .
  &apos;we didnt want that kind of lifestyle anymore .
 we sinkies dont want that lifestyle anymore as well .
 for every one of them that left ,  at least 3 fts that are stranded in their own nations cant wait to come here .
 1 mossad left and villages of motherland will pour in ,  creating thousands of goo ld jobbs for sinkies .
 i’m climaxing when typing this 
 if expats stay on edmw oso kpkb them
 plot twist: mossad stay here 2 years finish collect all the covid wayang intel by the mmtf .
 now is time to finish assignment and go us to share intel with cia about the unknown status here .
 too many expat worshippers here lor
 can chiu stop asking questions that hurt .
 thats like asking why bbfa is single
 these strawberry foreigners ,  a little bit of restrictions they cant handle .
 just feck off we are full .
 billions of ceca waitin for angmo to give up jods
 he oredi mentioned ,  it &apos;s easy to travel to places from singpaore .
 his motive is to enjoy life ,  travel etc .
 singapore now cannot offer that .
 so they leave to other places lor
 cos kumgong sinkies and new citizens voted for the gahment they deserved
 condo u dont renovate oso look like **** mah .
 so it &apos;s same same .
 renovation is key to making your flat or condo look good .
 im seeing more cecas and their family at bedok reservoir .
 singapore is  &apos;easy &apos; lolol .
 this is a word to decribe those ,  usually women ,  of loose ways ,  aka like a whore n prostitute .
 how come all your post is promoting cheena ,  bashing western countries and now u insult singapore ?
 why dont u just move to cheena to stay ?
 easy come easy go
 why dont u stay on topic n stop imagining bogeyman .
 or for start why dont u move to tw or murica ?
 these people see any criticism of cheena will immediately jump in and defend as if their life is on the line .
 almost as if there is some monetary incentives to do so .
 on the other hand chiu dont see such similar intense dedication when it comes to singapore .
 in fact these jokers often like to criticise singapore gahment and sinkies .
 most can oredi conclude these people are not sinkies and are either jhk or tiongs foreign agents stirring shet here .
 guess what feedback he received ?
 using my 32inch samsung tv as monitor since i never watch fta programme anymore
 might buy a 27 &apos; next time .
 looking to downgrade to 23/24inch fhd .
 post on carousell no one interested to trade
 younger gen uses reddit or other forums .

 yeah who is this cai ?
 family not super well off but doing alright is oredi a blessing for chiu .
 a degree holder doing masters soon that is something very good i must say .
 based on your height and weight chiu are quite overwhelming even for guys in singapore ,  let alone gals .
 height no choice but weight is something u can control for sure .
 u can finish your degree going further studies so what is weight control for u right ?
 really don’t see why u should feel depress .
 40yo bbfa reporting .
 didn’t try for local masters .
 oso wanted to experience a different country… .
 i went to cheena for a one month+ exchange during my poly days before and quite like the place .
 so decided to take the chance
 thank chiu sir for your kind words .
 my friends always calls me baymax 
 dont be sad ok ,  chiu do facebook live ,  i donate stars for u .
 i enjoy being married .
 one must choose carefully though .
 but this type of thing takes time and experience .
 how old are chiu ,  may i ask ?
 why are u so insecure  ?
 chiu have the height ,  education and rich family background .
 please stop the comparison with your peers .
 be thankful that chiu have all these attributes  .
 some edmwers like evilsun ,  say porkgai ,  golem ,  noobdriver are in a poorer state than chiu  .
 i am pretty much an introvert  don’t get how people do fb live haha
 thank chiu sir…i don’t like to compare bah…just that got this thought especially at night
 ts ,  enjoy in cheena .
 exercise a bit to cut down weight .
 u have the height
 single is the best  .
 ts oredi has best outcome .
 idk how true is it but some of my friends mentioned that they prefer me at this weight ?
 cos there was a period of time that i skimmed down alot .
 (~85kg) and my friends say i look damn bad ?
 ts is very well off physically oredi ,  compared to me  32yo 2/10 face buang bui bui forever alone balding shorty   .
 chiur fwens want chiu to stay in bbfa crub with us forever .
 at least with covid over ,  u can find sex
 really ah…cos my this friend damn fit one but he mentioned that i am more suited for the bulking figure (ie .
 fat or muscles) then lean…
 mai latdat…my face oso cmi 
 best is muscular .
 if chiu can be muscular at 1 .
 chiu wont even have time to complain in here liao .
 so many dino bu around ,  lower your standard
 ts mai jjww la  .
 either u do something about it or focus on other things
 heng all moi cc maxed out .
 on a parallel thread got 1x case where $100k was taken ,  then $ was taken from her credit card via easicredit transfer or cash withdrawal ?
 but these cc transfer normally takes a day or two .
 but ocbc so nua until a few days later the cc cash went into the account and again transfer out to the scammer bank .
 no blacklist the scammers &apos; bank number ?
 its iphones fault  .
 its a called  &apos;smart phone &apos; for a reason  .
 if not smart enough to detect the sms is phishing then i spend so much money to buy iphone for what  ?
 same goes to singtel  .
 i paid month for thier serices  .
 the isp oso should be storng enough to not let scammers to sms me  .
 liddat i pay 118 monthly for thier service for what  ?
 they will receive my lawyer letter very soon  .
 no consumer prottection at all  .
 all the bank apps are busy advertising their services in their app rather than security .
 ownself check ownself .
 so no blame culture please
 cant ocbc stop the remittance given that is such a big amount and clearance of account to overseas ?
 dont such remittances (big amount or clearance of account) send an alert to the bank &apos;s cyber security department ?
 how come the remit is the immediate effect ?
 cant banks reverse the transfer ?
 cant a bank have a system like if want transfer big amount ,  it has to subject bank due diligence first (eg video call customer ,  video call the transferee) ?
 dont tell me the bank has no obligation to look after your money ?
 my question is firstly how those scammers know these people have ocbc account ?
 what is the most important thing is not to find fault .
 is to find the culprits behind the act .
 if the culprits are not caught and given life sentence .
 they will come up with a more foolproof scam and claim more victims .
 i think the laws are very lenient to these scammers .
 oni a few years of jail after being caught .
 thats why more and more joining to be scammers .
 cos the risk to reward is good .
 like our pap election
 purpose of bank is to provide banking service .
 ocbc failed to provide that service .
 if chiu go counter ask for life savings ,  confirm will hold and kena questions .
 why are there no checks for large transfers ?
 oso i believe the no otp issue ,  cos dbs oredi kena many times liao .
 i think majority is still bank fault .
 going down the hierarchy of controls ,  ocbc should fundamentally implement additional layer of securities or upgrade its security layers before pushing it down to the users .
 this scam has been going on for years and worsen recently when they all move to e-token / sms log ins
 mass spam oni .
 i no ocbc account oso received the sms
 in edmw tradition ,  those who dont have much $$ in banks will laff and sleep very at night knowing people richer than them are scammed and made penniless .
 same thing for little kids if died in accidents .
 those few bbfas will blame parents not rich dont give birth
 orr chee bee chee ought to shoulder responsibility
 if the police of different countries can cooperate ,  they can trace to the receiving end .
 all money transferred should be traceable from source to destination .
 someone hack into ocbc database .
 opened another can of worms  
 overseas-chinese banking corporation 
 must be ahtc fault .
 i dont think its possible to perform transactions without auth from the owner .
 its possible that the phishing site was setup and the first otp could have been provided by the victim through the phishing site which the scammer then used in the real site to change the phone number that the otp was sent to ?
 have not eaten this before ,  so red  .
 name of the dish  ?
 wa mutton soup ah .
 dunno y it gives me the super unhealthy vibe
 drink tea can sleep later  ?
 your meal looks more like breakfast
 used to always eat in little india…… .
 anyways ,  is that tea in the cup ?
 not scared cannot sleep after drinking ?
 so late eat this unhealthy foods
 like eating a bowl of chilli 
 this color not healthy
 eat dat red bowl hw to sleep at night ?
 your dinner so late and red ?
 must share name of dish leh .
 this is legendary mee kuah
 how come mee kuah they gave  french loaf slices to dip ?
 why never eat prata ?

 next day got laosai chilli ?
 no one tell him vax le still can tioed and get serious ill + can die ?
 he just need wait they activate booster shot ,  from 85% vaxxed to 0% vaxxed
 this cb kia is really all abt statistics .
 percentage percentage percentage  .
 vaccines vaccines vaccines
 aljunied reject show true colours liao
 aljunied people really got balls and got brains  .
 see through this small eye cunning fellow
 high vaccination rate means they got excuse to faster fully open up like before covid .
 then their gdp will be achieved .
 we forefront among countries with highest vaccination rate = we become case study for other countries when bad consequences happen despite high vaxx rates .
 he really trigger reg flag
 85% probably not enough for him .
 wont be surprised he tasked the expert community  to look into vaccinated infants to increase the rate further .
 singapore can thrive as a closed economy is it ?
 u want to plant vegetables in kampong ?
 ya i one look see his rat face dont like liao
 now u mention ,  really looks like a rat  .
 small eyes pointy nose .
 typical of a cunning evil person
 last month ,  15 people have died from covid !
 today &apos;s number exceed 200 with 109 unlinked .
 they are so chill about this ?
 now i believe we are just numbers to them .
  if tomorrow i die from covid ,  it will just be a +1 on their death statistics .
 the classic who did chiu vote ?
 thats what happened when u have a incompetent team .
 holy prince so far never hear about him having gf .
  he likes girl one or not ?
 bloody useless rat !
 ya it &apos;s either underlying conditions and it is inevitable .
 sinkies are just a number to them
 his bonus gaogao liao exceeded kpi
 wont get sick of it
 bbfas eat cai png oso wont get sick of it
 look at how many sinkies jin excited to serve ns and cant wait to sign on to continue motivating people ,  that will give chiu a good gauge of how good they are at motivating people .
 generals who fought zero wars and maybe have not held a gun for years .
 it &apos;s like calling someone casanova when he havent had sex for years .
 who more powerful than him ?
 screw up oso no1 dare to say he wrong and instead grovel to praise him .
 most sakti of all  &apos;generals &apos;
 i heard he screwed up quite badly in oz in one of his ventures
 all i remembered was that winston choo was an ambassador to somewhere .
 papship sure triggered  .
 winston choo formal education oni o level ,   ask him be perm sec or senior gahment official is bu ky .
 so oni assign him diplomat roles on the account of his staff officer experience in army .
 if general need touch gun then i scared lol .
 and oso if need fight war to govern singapore then no one will qualify ?
 his wife lagi more powerful though .
 self elected almighty empress dowager .
 can bypass watever protocols .
 the earlier senior civil servants oso didnt have degrees .
 took over public transport at worst possible time ,  tio stoned to death by social media ,  did not delete negative comments on his fb ,  just went to fix the problems
 dedicated to army .
 no need to try & fit into any private or public entity as management .
 i dont really know the real reason  .
 helming ntuc very well !
 do not expect him to work ot .
 exactly why he got rid of him ,  why would anyone help someone who will eventually become his boss ?
 typical sinkie pawn sinkie .
 chiu still newbie in management la .
 just like my ahseng supervisior many many years ago ,  he probably thought i will get ahead of him eventually ,   thats why he act like a tyrant ,  always try ways & means to get rid of me + alot of other shet things .
 no ,  the supervisor will never be promoted to an engineer cos he do not have the skills sets .
 he is oni a hands on person .
 i do track the learning progress with the supervisor and the fresh graduate every week .
 once the fresh graduate complained to me that his working environment is dusty ,  hot and stuffy .
 both the supervisor and i was stunned and kept quiet for a few seconds .
 what’s wrong of leaving for better job ?
 demand and supply
 i dunnid that reply .
 there is a lack of sinkie graduates applying for the job .
 we hired a utm grad .
 that is reality ,  whether chiu believe it or not is not changing my company seeing her this july/aug .
 that is why the company should not appoint some one noob to assume that position .
 the new gen are more used to using the mobile than using their human skills to work .
 the new engineer may not be able to learn any thing from the old bird and end up not able to perform his work .
 some one with working experience will be able to get along with the lao jiao and see through what tricks that the lanjiao is playing .
 the lanjiao may end up giving the noob the wrong info to sabo him .
 one local employee tender then oredi wanna higher from overseas ?
 actually what &apos;s wrong ?
 better to quit early than later .
 if quit later ,  is waste your and his time .
 probation is liddat what
 sinkies are forgoing a 4 .
 5k pay and have to work in non air-con environment ?
 must add in at least $500 hardship allowance 
 5k so high he dont want .
 cannot train poly grad ?
 5k up he will pia mia oredi .
 5 and no aircon ,  no wonder leave .
 please do the needful .
 he got a begree ,  chiu need to pay for his potential 
 please ,  he is on the job training and the pay is around there with a chance of increment after probation .
 maybe he was bullied by the group of technicians he was assigned with .
 if really as per what chiu said ,  i think is very good for fresh for acmv contractor .
 unless your ot hours is ungodly .
 so either the freshie is strawberry or got hidden details lor .
 if i freshie that time receive this type of pay and working hours in construction i will very happy .

 everywhere in the world is suffering some kind of sort .
 flooding in cheena , oman dessert 2 yrs of rain fall in 2 days causing drastic damage .
 when earning money that time dont see them come out to do charity or donation .
 now no business for 2 weeks oni oredi cried help ?
 other business owners in thailand still can donate food to the needy while having zero business .
 this is why i dont pity these black heart owners in sinkieland 
 wa this joyre group got 31 branches  ?
 the owner must be very rich what so why worry over just 1 month no business ?
 they oredi take in the money when they signed membership .
 so ,  what are they complaining about  ?
 they are having no customers to cash out the voucher now .
 this is how ktv cluster happen
 better start offering rub a tug .
 haha chiu got see the facebook singapore quarantine groups .
 all the complain .
 really makes your blood boil
 tell the expat mai hypocrite la .
 it is the pandemic .
 it is the same everywhere else .
 in fact it is their fark up attitude of not wearing mask and fond of gathering and partying that kept the pandemic longer .
 knn reuters one sided leepokting again .
 so many ceca still leeching here in sinkapur .
 have some respect for our sinkies both females or males .
 if chiu dont agree ,  please leave .
 there are many more important discussions to partake than this .
 ya  ,  when sheet hit the fan  ,  just head for the exit .
 thank for leeching .
 to ensure other angmor expats can get jobs in singapore ?
 they &apos;ve zero loyalty to singapore .
 fair weather folks .
 all these so called news are released to time the real bad news release of data like jobs data showing sinkies are staying jobless and unemployed while more fts are given ep-pass to work in singapore .
 yes ,  i can further hypothesize that the sense of entitlement that fts had developed over the years and especially during the covid period in singapore is due to the fact that pm lee had over the last 20 years  given foreigners super easy access to the good high skilled and high salary jobs in singapore as well as put them on a pedestal .
 please send some nsf to protect them
 the numbers must be significant until pm 3 speeches said welcome them .
  mtf not producing outstanding results ,  expats are neither comfortable nor confident ,  so they go .
 oni thambi ceca stays and bang bang
 not oni audis ,  generally conti cars have more problem .
 continental cars are liddat .
 no money send car to workshop ,  don’t act atas .
 conti cars are made to survive in conti climate not in this god forsaken place 
 i used to drive vw golf got .
 knn so many problems .
 everytime go service and repair is min 5k and above .
 now driving a humble honda .
 wa 5 yrs liao not much problem at all .
 2 brands with worst reliability audi and bmw .
 the more complex the car ,  the more problems it has .
 every electronic sensor etc installed is a problem waiting to happen .
 audi ,  volvo and vw especially .
 always see my friend complain on socials  .
 those driving merc ok lehb
 the infamous mechatronic ?
 driving a audi a6 here dont encounter any issue at all .
 close to 3 years old car leh .
 maintain on time should serve u well ,  not a question about conti or asian cars .
 alot people say conti car leak engine oil and need to top up ,  i dont encounter such issue before .
 wait till your warranty end then tok .
 keeping finger crossed .
 3 years old audi is considered still ok liao .
 when your warranty runs out this year ,  and the clever german engineers have long planned for the obsolescence of mechanical and electronic parts ,  let us know how chiu doing next year (4th year) .
 vw group didnt become so big by building bulletproof cars that dunnid repair ,  replacement and maintenance .
  same goes for bmw .
 they are in the business of selling cars ,  maintenance ,  and parts
 this is so true
 ex colleague drives 5yr old a6 ,  he carries a bottle of engine oil in his boot .
 u should google the issue ,  its a design issue not maintenance related .
 by the way ,  the audi eat eo was previous gen issue .
 i think newer gens dont haf .
 except for wear n tear la .
 as long as your piston rings age and get carbon ,  etc .
 some oil will seep into the combustion chamber .
 my old a4 eat eo like sai .
 one week top up almost 1l .
 not just that but the workshop will oso hold off replacing parts that should be replaced until your warranty expires and they can bill chiu for it .
 in my experience ,  never hold a conti car into or past the final year of warranty .
 just top up some money and buy porsche ,  problems solved .
 audi ,  bmw and merz cars can do away with signal lights function as drivers rarely use it .
 save some $$ as well .
 sorry boss my car too powerful before i is signal oredi in front of chiu liao .
 what if 90% of such transactions are actually legit ?
 will the others whom are not affected be complaining about the delay in transfer of money ?
 it should not be so easy for banks to transfer money else that will become another issue altogether ,  banks act on instructions of the owner of the money ,  the account holder should look after their own money ?
 one thing is for sure .
 ocbc name is going to be shit soon if they dont make a satisfying statement soon
 customer gong gong enter bank accounts details .
 bank gong gong just process the transfer of 100k from local to foreign account within minutes and not flagging it out
 we’re in a ever fast pace environment that if we see urgent or in the mist of something we want to get it done asap .
 if not you’ll be scolded for wasting their time .
 this discourages people to pay attention in what they are doing .
 if they could oso pay more attention ,  plus a little bit of tech knowledge .
 i’m confident this won’t happen .
 edit: regardless of engineering ,  mice ,  etc .
 my former managers expects me to be fast ,  even though i’m slower in mental processing
 dont trust and dont use digital banking cos sms otp is not secure .
 the banks can send otp to scammers ,  or scammers can intercept otps .

 hope your parents get scammed so i can come in and gloat oso .
 updates to a) terms and conditions governing ocbc paynow service and ocbc cross-border paynow service and b) terms and conditions governing electronic banking services – paynow default daily limit is now revised to s$1 , 000​ .
 ​isnt it a bit too late now .
 ya i mean even if it &apos;s late is like wut ?
 u just reduce 5000 to 1000 ,  got use meh ?
 if another victim click on the phishing link in sms ,  the scammer just change to 50k limit and transfer  .
 whose great idea ah ?
 but if chiu are busy and need to get things done ,  it’s very easy to overlook the well planned scam .
 how many and how often one does that ?
 so system to detect ?
 bank could have hold the transaction .
 for urgent cases  ,  large sum ,  account owner physically go to the local branch .
 i made a warning on 24th dec on my whatsapp groups lol .
 but moi no frens ,  cant scam moi frens if moi aint got no nothing
 how to expect all sinkies to be it literate .

 when chiu are in cheena ,  do look out for your diet as the weather is cold .
 it is easier for chiu to gain weight there easily  .
 i think as long as u reduce your weight ,  try to change your dress code and hairstyles should be a small improvements .
 damn bro chiu are right .
 my dress sense sucks (typically shorts and t-shirt) will try to improve on that
 where u find such a group de ?
 just worry too much la ts .
 you &apos;re still pretty young and have a bright future ahead of chiu .
 you &apos;re pretty tall and a bit bui bui but moi think chiu just need to slim down a bit then you &apos;ll look good liao given your body height/ frame .
 do both cardio and strength training ,  but most importantly do at your own comfortable pace and to avoid injuries .
 just go to cheena and do your masters with an open mind .
 if you &apos;re comfortable with yourself and your surroundings ,  then naturally you &apos;ll make friends anywhere chiu go one .
 i heard they are oso short  .
 pika is cross dresser  i have no idea why he does that but it brings joy to edmwers

 how old were those people who died ?
 due to covid or underlying conditions ?
 aiyo ivory jiakliaobees please make up your mind la ,  always shift goalpost so xiasuay .
 so first few never report .
 wait until 13 then report ?
 so how many more from the wet markets and hawker centres ?
 so weird of chiu to quote suicide cause suicide is something different from covid .
 might as well quote car crash ,  drowning .
 hmmm sounds fishy .
 0 vax related death in sg
 so all those old people that die recently are from that cluster ?
 doesn’t make sense
 mus be the fish kena cobid
 is really sibei chio 
 add to playing list !
 i could fap to those eyes all day .
 still like e original by madonna .
 she is the reason why i like french songs  , the first french female singer i like ,  she got many nice french songs 
 i think this is what make her famous back then .
 now she quite old liao .
 but i dunno if she learn her dance moves from wow or wow copied her dance moves for the elves .

 not bad not bad .
 is she still virgin ?
 nothing beats madonna

 vous êtes les bienvenus ,  en effet elle est très belle  .
 my ns road march song .
 thanks for sharing  .
 her voice lack punch ,  madonna have average vocals and still sounds sounds better .
 so this a golorified karaoke getai level
 sell after warranty dont buy second hand
 chiu want satki than chiu must accept the pain .
 i like this positive attitude .
 update us again when chiu reached 5 years mark .
 conti car out of warranty period better sell .
 worst is those folks who go and buy coe conti cars .
 those coe conti cars might as well be brand new cars underneath the old skin ,  cos many of the mechanicals and electronics have oredi been replaced before or due to be replaced .
 good luck to those people who want face but cannot afford .
 etc diff story oredi 
 heng moi drive jap car
 heng mercedes made in thailand ,  considered made in asia car
 for this gearbox ,  try not to get stuck in traffic often .
 clutch wear out faster
 wats your mileage ?
 how much is a refurb audi mu or 7dsg ?
 frend bought a second hand a8l told me quite cheap as owner difficult to sell it .
 my altis last time ,  i never once check engine oil .
 drove till scrap
 ts never mention what problem .
 many audi renew coe to drive another 10 yrs
 ts no drive complain what
 clutch alone is 2k .
 dont think got refurbish clutch .
 mech unit about 3-4k .
 maybe refurb half the price ?
 good luck to those owners then
 singapore sure got people rich enough to replace parts like these
 parents of the past would caning their children for not listening or against their parents with rotan but not now .
 @wwenze how does it feel to share cool stories oni to be debunked ?
 i have tracked his weekly progress .
 maybe chiu dunno about this ,  but there is a quick and easy way to see what the future prospect of a company is .
 just look at your immediate supervisor or hiring manager or whatever similar thing ,  cos that is how he will be a short while later .
 is that guy having a good life ?
 is he earning a high pay ?
 maybe just casually ask ,  what car he drives ?
 how &apos;s his family life ?
 maybe he see chiu as his boss he oredi half-sianz oredi .
 dont even know how to use the [debunked] tag ,  later he do his job properly chiu oso say [debunked] .
 he just stayed there to earn a month pay while waiting for a better job ,  or maybe just out of courtesy .
 then they take over your role .
 and chiu become no value-add .
 thus y  share lol .
 share oso 25% nia
 maybe malaysians like chiu should be more appreciative towards singapore .
 do not share too much cool stories to increase the fake profile of malaysians ,  especially fresh graduates .
 malaysian universities are not particularly prestigious especially when they are from third world developing countries .
 i will gladly hire a good malaysian anytime but if i ever see yours or equivalent csb profile ,  out the window it goes .
 do not underestimate singapore engineers .
 a ceca can do the job for 2 .
 work in hot and stuffy environment ,  $3 .
 but add in dusty environment ,  sorry ,  i don’t want oredi .
 cannot tahan dusty places .
 all grads have to suck up to u and say yes
 he is a fresh graduate who needs guidance on  every step of the way .
 touch your heart la .
 5k is over pay meh .
 if u got a kid and he got 2 offers .
 5k  work 8-5pm no ot from m-f ,  but need on site and in dusty environment and hot .
 30-6pm ,  occasionally ot ,  but air con environment and can wfh ,  especially during this pandemic period .
 which u will ask your kid to choose .
 especially during this pandemic period ,  wfh much better and safer
 lol chiu ask o levels supervisor to teach a degree grad ?
 it &apos;s oredi a huge red flag .
 actually he left early now is better than waste everyone &apos;s time after completed all the training .
 for the record ,  i do not think the pay is fantastic at 3 .
 i think its fair as the company is currently employing him to train and for the tasks he is doing right now ,  we could have employed a fresh technician at 2 .
 the company had high hopes in cultivating him ,  improving his career prospects and the next generation of engineers .
 maybe he need guidance from chiu more than the supervisor whom he is supposed to whack when he passed his probation .
 why your co never groom supervisor to reach the required skill sets ?
 if he wants to ,  he can go for courses at polytechnic and later at university .
 he doesnt seem to have the drive to learn anyway .
 be glad he left after oni 1 months .
 better then train for few months or a year then resign what
 i believe chiu are saying that the supervisor do not have the paper qualification for the role .
 did chiu inform the new engineer of the actual working condition during the interview or chiu are not involved in the interview  ?
 seems like there is some mis-communication or the noob lied about being able to do the work in the harsh environment .
 naos drives bus oso cans gets 3 .
 stills needs to learns sho many things and works unders hots suns for huats ?
 i think that the present gen is pretty straight forward .
 they will not suffer or stay in a new job that they dont like at all .
 they will resign immediately .
 their parents will be able to feed them .
 my mom done cash deposit to uob using the automatic deposit machine using her own at the moment card .
 she inserted her at the moment card and deposited a sum of cash in and receipt came out that it was another person (unknown) savings account .
 my mom immediately went to the branch to clarify and the cso raised a form indicating  &apos;wrong transfer of account &apos; as if it was my mom fault .
 went back to clarify and confirmed my mom actually inserted her at the moment before she put in the cash to the automatic deposit machine .
 the cso supervisor then voided the old form and amend the description .
 uob cso said it could be someone else account but my mom put in cash .
 but fact is my mom inserted her own at the moment but yet the money went to another account number .
 was advice it typically take a month as they need to seek the person whom received the $$ to return .
 but this is a technical error and not a wrong transfer of sum .
 my mom wass adviced to wait for about a month for uob to investigate and conclude .
 not sure if anyone experienced such situation and what are the options besides waiting for uob to come back ?
 im skeptical that uob just revert with  &apos;case close &apos; after a month of wait .
 such a big cock up oso can ?
 i suggest chiu to file a police report
 i thought insert am card will be own account .
 hope your mum get the money back immediately
 how much is that amount ?
 insert own at the moment card .
 key in personal pin .
 but can deposit into other people account ?
 how could this error be technically possible when she inserted her at the moment card ?
 jitao report mas ,  uob will wake up their idea after tat
 let them investigate loh .
 chiu ask here hoping the cso is a registered member here to solve your problem meh~ ?
 this sounds like a major atm/comp .
 system cockup sia
 actually i think can be done ?
 cos when chiu do a cash deposit there will be an option  &apos;deposit to own account ?
 and if chiu press no ,  chiu key in the other party &apos;s account .
 recently hackers managed to hijack otp .
 chiu got read anot .
 the uob guy said this may take one month to clear up .
 if this is clearly the bank’s system fault then how come i the customer should suffer that kind of lengthy investigation period ?
 must see cctv to see if really got key in another party’s account liao
 provided what u said is true .
 this kind better file police report then put big big on fb/mothership/xin ming/wan bao/ .
 so they will take note .
 ts maybe your mum did this then entered the wrong account number .
 better double triple confirm with your mum before making police report .
 file police report
 then what chiu want them to do~ ?
 deposit into other people &apos;s account wrongly is quite sop one .
 call wanbao ,  mum ship ,  mas .
 pawn them deep .
 somehow think this is a one-sided story .
 i am trying to hit the gym more often nowadays (trying to do 5x a week) mostly cardio .
 i am oso thinking of going back to meal replacement shake (breakfast - lunch [shake] - dinner) .
 i used to do that a few years back ,  but it was more extreme…i had 2 meal replacement shakes and one solid meal a day on top of daily exercises .
 while i managed to drop to about 90kg ,  i was really unhappy and eventually ballooned .
 i tried wooing a gold digger before…the feeling sucks and i didn’t even realised until my friend managed to “pull” me out of the hole
 it is ok to worry ,  just try your best since chiu are oni 23 years old still can get pretty xmm .
 if chiu are 30 years old ,  chiu might have to start accepting some auntie-looking women .
 chiu forgot tell him go find thai girl ,  they can protect him too ,  all mostly know mui thai
 that’s my main worry…to be at 30 and still single
 no need to scare him he is still a young chap .
 love might find him at the most unexpected moment .
 we need to encourage him more than trying to give him negative comments on dating and marriage
 sian ,  local has to marry out .
 sinkies girls really so high standard meh ?
 thank chiu sir ,  thou it’s true that if chiu married someone that is really jialat…it’s gonna be very jialat
 u wont get love .
 but u can has a cheeseburger instead 
 idk i find sinkie girl really high standards… .
 out of the 3 i woo ,  oni one was local .
 one was from cheena and the last one was from malaysia
 lol chiu open eye say blind word haha but i like haha
 i prefer (double) filet-o-fish
 what kind or cardio u doing ?
 eat clean can le ,  those shake expensive sia .
 i used this method to lose 20kg .
 bfast cereal ,  those healthy types .
 not the sugary ones .
 lunch i eat whatever i want .
 need to be in good mood to exercise happily .
 dinner ,  cereal again .
 sometimes if before sleep ,  i will eat a biscuit or 2 if hungry .
 but i go gym 7 days .
  member of fitness first .
 i do body combat ,  rpm and body pump .
 need to build muscles ,  dont just do cardio
 im 25 ,  ps i thought i was 24 back then ,  couldnt care about my age ,  didnt bother to celebrate my birthday at all ,  had dated 2 officially ,  4 underground (means parent dunno one)
 there are more sinkie girls than sinkie guys from gahment stats .
 i am oso surprise why so many edmwers are unable to find .
 it could be due expectation mismatch .
 80/20 rules always exist .
 women and men who are still in denial of their own standard will be single  ,  aiming for the 20% which doesn’t exist anymore
 cut down on sugar ,  sugar is the real killer on weight gain
 chiu tried to do too much liao in a short matter of time ,  thats why chiu gave up and bounced back .
 instead of forcing yourself to go 5x a week ,  try to aim at least 3x a week instead ?
 and do more research on compound body exercises which can help chiu to burn more fat and build muscles too .
 just cardio alone wont help much de .
 rather than wasting money and buying shakes ,  focus on eating lesser unhealthy food and try to have a more balanced diet .
 im in the same predicament as chiu 22m but instead ,  i choose to stay single as of now (probably in the near future too) cos of personal ideals .
 dont fret too much ,  as someone who believes in fatalism ,  what will come ,  will come !
 will suay for the entire year or not ?
 why mod dont wait until cny end then issue ?
 u will huat for the entire year
 is will huat or suay sia ?
 serve as reminder dont anyhow post for the niu year 
 heng ong huat   
 heng ah ong ah huat ah .
 ts ,  grand supremacy member leh .
 what did chiu post ?
 wa ,  eve of cny mods oso hard at work .
 i know why chiu kena oredi haha 
 if chiu tattoo the mod name that given chiu the infraction pts on your penis .
 it will be huat for chiu on the coming years .
 chiu counter his curse .
 if not it is suay
 dont mind the points but scare the timing oni .
 horz horz horz .
 ts gonna suayz big time for this entire year liao !
 get more infraction points til chiu hit auspicious total of 18 points
 for what offend
 what pic did u post ?
 how many vaxxed ?
 lol the mistress cross examine the wife .
 knn would pay to watch
 we will see more death soon ,  our icu would be quickly overwhelmed at this rate .
 we arent doing anything to actually prevent those absolutely .
 we merely managed it .
 so what &apos;s this hoo ha about covid when we are oredi mostly vaccinated ?
 majority should be fine with it anyways .
 my family has achieved  &apos;herd immunity &apos; .
 100% of my family members are fully vaccinated .
 does it mean we dont have to close our home for visitors now whenever there are rises in infection cases in the community ?
 means chiu oni immune herd wise nia ,  they keep import wolves chiu these herds of sheep want immune oso no use
 a pack of wolves .
 a flock of sheep .
 a herd of sinkies 
 should sue the outsource coy .
 cognizant hcl or wadever for millions then take the money compensate back to the customer
 surprising 63% (so far) thinks it &apos;s the banks fault .
 those voted yes are noobs  .
 should i move my funds back to dbs ?
 i was looking through my ocbc sms and realized that i didn’t receive any warning sms not to click on suspicious links on dec 23 .
 i oni received on dec 30 and jan 5 .
 but ocbc said they send out warning sms on dec 23 .
 did they really send to all customers ?
 “ocbc added that it sent out its first media advisory on dec .
 23 to warn of a surge in these scams .
 it oso sent out a second advisory on dec .
 30 ,  to warn of a potential surge in attacks over the new year weekend”
 it &apos;s their fault for releasing the fund and not detecting anomaly .
 people have spending behaviors and sudden big sums xfer should be detect as anomaly .
 should have a sms message .
 u r about to xfer 1000000 dollar please reply yes to proceed  .
 are u sure to proceed with this xfer .
 iphone / safari / chrone fault la .
 how come never block the phishing website ?
 i has to be their fault partially ,  if it isn’t then why would they implement such measures after this incident ?
 maybe some suggestions of how to strengthen .
 after they strengthen ,  some people will write in to say too many layers of protection ,  cumbersome process ,  can banks look into simplifying .
 here we go again .
 overseas addition of payee should have a 24 hr lockup period before money can be sent .
 33% stupid user fault .
 33% telco fault for divert sms hack
 is not strengthen everything petty sum like under 100 dunnid strengthen .
 unless consecutive 50 times 100 .
 but sum more then 50 percent is anomaly
 cos the scammers impersonated the bank ,   .
 conned the account holders into giving details to facilitate them to impersonate the account holders to con the bank into executing the transactions under the impression that they were the ‘instructions of the account holders’ ?
 needles never poke their flesh so they won’t field pain 
 iphone fault lah
 so what would be the threshold ?
 i am not sure everyone’s risk threshold ?
 this can oso be data analytics data science .
 user past data can detect anomaly .
 like usual month is xfer 1k around monthly for the pass 10 month .
 this month 50k .
 anomaly is just unusual from the normal past data .
 just get a double confirmation with anomaly .
 do chiu wish to proceed xfer 50k question .
 she wins by having anot bad voice + most importantly ,  she &apos;s an eye candy  .
 cos oni 1 fully vaxxed died .
 be like the people in the uk .
 this is the new normal .
 but can our karens accept ?
 so many country has reported vaccine death regardless what brand there is out there .
 and in singapore ,  not even one death .
 u all better go n think again  .
 sinkie so strong until no death ?
 or are we just a natural vaccine sucker ?
 all kiasee as usual .
 that’s oso why the economy needs foreigners .
 sinkies kiasee and nothing will ever be done .
 there are oso many whoseh no deaths related ,  like hk
 oyk: let’s wait and see how many more die
 wuhan oso fish related
 suicide ,  car crash and drowning ,  they do not spread .
 waaa … ktv cluster safer … no death and can song song gao larwendar… .
 power toot toot train is always ky
 must sing together then nice .
 sing solo no nice
 they oso kena shopeed .
 so they are colleague with cr7 now ?
 nicely written lyrics ,  like a poem ,  everything reverse
 power la this uncle
 vocal not bad in cover version .
 this is oni 1 half of the duo ,  what happened to the other half ?
 power station of cos is ky !
 really is friendly and just want to do music .
 their concert is the best !
 still good just not as god like as last time .
 the other guy just gotten married
 put body ahead of health
 your problem meh ?
 chiu no life ah .
 your whole family and relatives got take covid vaccine boh ?
 actually i know of one such person irl .
 he thinks he wont get covid cos he hikki at home lol
 jio mod 7pm tbp tonight .
 oh then it &apos;s prob the old staff making life difficult for the grad so once he resign can keep his rice bowl
 actually its more than the paper .
 engineers need to understand drawings and vet system designs .
 probably the newbies impression of the work is different from actual work .
 maybe is how we worked that got him scared .
 i do not really expect him to be a hands on person but in our field sometimes even the directors go down to site to teach the technicians how to clean the parts and troubleshoot .
  probably it was the unspoken expectations that we displayed .
 now many engineer grads all upskill and jump to do software engineer/data analytics liao lor .
 limpeh alot of friends(chemical/mech/electrical/aerospace engineering) liddat de .
 no computer science background oso can go ncs/dbs/dsta and code .
 all these coding jobs pay 4k and upwards ,  sit inside cozy aircon office ,  got career climbing prospects ,  and lesser office politics .
 engineeer company need to up pay to attract/retain engineer graduates la .
 sinkie grads can tahan hot weather ,  but not with mediocre pay .
 if he were paid better would he have stayed ?
 i got logistics cert can become engineer ?
 i promise to follow the boss everywhere 
 terkan to force him out .
 job security mah .
 maybe my mistake .
 anyway thanks edmw .
 why cant chiu get a dip holder for it ?
 he do not even have a diploma .
 the position of an engineer is suppose to manage the team of technicians and at the same time read plans ,  vet designs for new refrigeration system .
 he is oni a hands on person ,  as good as nitec .
 most likely he is the reason behind the engineer &apos;s quit .
 i would do that too if my rice bowl is threatened .
 his rice bowl was not threatened .
 we had an engineer managing him for a very long time .
 even with the shortfalls in engineers ,  he cannot take on those roles .
 this type of toxic character .
 not surprised your engr run road .
 u hire ahbeng or snek maybe got chance
 +1 to this ,  i have some army friends who studied civil engineering & i would say about 70% have left or are leaving liao .
 the rest 25% are in engineering design firms so more office based & going down the pe track .
 those on site always cite the same excuse ,  mediocre pay (or same pay as those office counterparts) while they pull in 6 day weeks with long hours .
 it &apos;s not so much the hours as the pay itself .
 oso the lack of regulation of the term  &apos;engineer &apos; .
 in europe oni those who graduate from engineering schools - often 5 years - get to call themselves an engineer .
 here there &apos;s no such regulation ,  oni for those who become pes after a long while .
 so anybody becomes engineer & the job scope oso becomes more of a supervisory role than actual engineering .
 if threadstarter is really serious about trying to hire cheaper local engineers ,  and foster the local engineering scene ,  and actually has the power to hire people ,  why not ?
 since everyone agree that chiu dont really need much of what chiu learn in uni to do your job .
 like ,  maybe ask ramesh and misha ,  too .
 and even the basics chiu can learn from internet nowadays .
 lky had the right idea with the poly system and limited uni intake .
 however if threadstarter is working in a big company or mnc which has a rigid employment structure ,  like for example engineer-1 must have a degree ,  then llst ,  that one i oso can understand .
 lky had the right idea .
 not all jobs require chiu to understand and use fourier transform ,  for example .
 (and chiu can learn enough of it reading audiosciencereview anyway lol) .
 or advanced calculus .
 and the problem with engineering prospects in singapore is that ,  even if we study advanced calculus ,  there is a lack of high-paying jobs requiring advanced calculus available here .
 so what happens ?
 and everybody is unhappy .
 maybe hire a ceca to pawn him .
 your engineer is those bookworm .
 but your technician supervisor is seasoned old bird .
 the saying goes; the older the ginger ,  the hotter it becomes .
 year 2021 still got unspoken expectations ?
 close down the coy la ts .
 hiring contract ,  all the terms to hantum the employee is all there .
 but when it comes to training chiu can come and tell us unspoken expectations ?
 maybe if contract got put  &apos;+s$500 to salary for every unspoken expectation that employee has to face &apos; then he might have stayed on .
 unless we are looking at the short term ,  actually polytechnic skills is insufficient for the growth of the company .
 the company wants to slowly groom in-house pes to increase our capabilities .
 but most importantly ,  they have to suit our company .
 me too i got bona fide science degree from nus .
 i promise to buy coffee for breakfast and shine the shoes too .
 6 day work week 12 hour shift can tahan no problem for s$3500 .
 aiya ,  why limit them until liddat .
 it is not that your refrigeration system is very complicated .
 just hire a dip holder for a fixed term and see how he swim or sink .
 just like my current job ,  they want simi master in it with 20 years experiences in enterprise db management + ai ,  in the end ,  i just sit there and watch that stupid monitor for error .
 if rich enough ,  just go buy brand new .
 unless chiu have alot of time making friends with workshop owner .
 it seems like audi sedans got more issues ?
 im driving a 3 .
 5yr q5 no issues with regular maintenance and quite fuel efficient too .
 so is it oso due to driving style ?
 same engine what
 typical conti problems are oil leaks ,  gearbox ,  engine parts like the injectors and ignition coils .
 add up easily more than 10k to replace .
 jap car maybe oni oil leak after several years .
 suv drivers are less rough with their cars .
 high cg the cornering not as good
 bmw e60 and previous still ok .
 not so many electronics .
 e65/66 oso not bad ,  can last .
 f01/02 and f10 turbocharged era onwards with tons more electronics ,  air suspension ,  electronic self leveling system and stuff ,  can forget it .
 drive 3 years better sell .
   personal experience with all of the above models .
 bought and drove an audi once .
 every other month in workshop .
 and have to top up engine oil as frequently as i top up petrol .
 changed to jap cars and no more issues .
 plus the jap cars i bought are not as petrol guzzling as my audi .
 engine oil disappearing issue is usually due to leaking piston rings .
 most engines above a certain age will do that ,  including japanese .
 for conti turbocharged cars ,  it comes even earlier cos of the relatively high wear and tear compared to lower powered and lower load on n .
 japanese engines - owners tend to drive more gently .
 volvos alot made in tiongland now .
 vin starts with l .
 german technolovy go down the drain leow .
 got jaguar ,  land rover .
 made in england ,  check for new strain covid
 to be fair ,  all those award-winning german engines of bmw and vw are technologically advanced ,  efficient and powerful .
 but longevity isnt a criteria when the car industry rates these engines .
 so just buy new ,  sell after 3 years to 5 years ,  and chiu wont regret owning one .
 simpler design ,  compound with local dealers stripping out as much as they can to lower omv .
 audi needs to churn out cars fast enough to grab market share mah ,  now bmw oso lost to audi in terms of market share .
 buy old 2nd hand car complain so much .
 i bought my audi brand new ,  not a single issue after 2 years and running .
 hemg moi i oni bmw(bus mrt walk)
 classic edmw thread .
 where all the jap/kr car owners start their argument with i-drove-a-conti-last-time .
 fkn arm chio  .
 those friends who updated to conti .
 all say they dont want to go back to jap/kr car .
 rl quite diff hor ?
 owned by tata motors .
 someone need to start selling blinker fluid .
 maybe makes sense oso ,  since jap/kr drivers tend to be a budget sort ,  whereas conti tend to be more willing to spend to upkeep .
 so those making noise people are those who from one group but jump to the other group unsuccessfully .
 japanese work culture very ke lian 
 in before edmw  &apos;i wanna marry her &apos;
 bo lang support ?
 i am just stating the facts .
 a master student with rich family is oredi half a battle won .
 i am telling him not to compare as i feel bad for ssfa in this forum when truth hurts for them .
 for ts ,  such issue is minor as compared to evilsun ,  saypg ,  noob and gang
 i am currently an anytime fitness member since may .
 but due to the p2ha i sorta of lost my momentum and am trying to get back .
 i typically do one hour on the treadmill .
 ~5km inclined brisk walk] .
 (still don’t have the stamina to run) .
 my plan is to do as much cardio as possible before switching to weights to build strengthz
 thank chiu sir ,  my family are middle income .
 i know that i have alot of opportunities that some others might not have and i am grateful for every single one of them .
 in this day and age ,  no reason for that .
  there &apos;s always the option of paying a girl to spend time with chiu   
 no doubt that is possible .
 i think someone in this forum did ask about doing this as a single and how their parents will view it .
 ok ,  can try walking outdoors ,  hiking etc .
 anyway ,  dunnid to look for love now la .
 enjoy first k ,  so dont rush to slim down so fast .
 enrich your life with experiences now is more important
 thank chiu sir for your advice .
 dont suffer from the disease onegina too fast
 sure chiu surf edmw at age 15
 in the end   love urself and people around u is more likely happen
 paying gerl to spend time no meaning de leh   .
 that is transactional and not genuine ,  not what im looking for 
 wow it’s been that long… .
 yep i initially came on to edmw-hwz to ask on further education advice and on which path should i choose after my n levels in sec 4
 25 is a nice age .
 i wish i can be 25 again !
 given your dating experience ,  chiu are probably at that stage where the next girl chiu find could be the one !
 paktor another 5 years .
 then marry at 30 .
 time to get serious and evaluate properly .
 keep having fun sowing wild oats lol
 about right…i hope to tie the knot at or just before 30 as well…
 when chiu are trapped in a marriage ,  chiu will auto try to reach out .
 either that or jump off a building (not kidding)
 then do something abt it .
 if u still worry n do nothing then u 40 oso bbfa .
 check yourself in the mirror n see where goes wrong or r u seeking in the right direction for gf
 slowly cut lor else too fast is bad for body
 30 is a good age .
 i replied chiu earlier on this .
 now is the time to learn to date .
 there are skills to learn .
 things to improve on internally .
 like your outlook on life .
 your ability to hold a conversation .
 you &apos;d be surprised .
 there are many girls who view character more important than looks and money .
 this is the correct target audience chiu want to attract .
 not money diggers who are oni interested in chiu when chiu have money .
 and i am not talking dino bu .
 many are pretty flowers .
 colour not healthy 
 50 is ok la i can afford 
 finish off with this  .
 huai no add fish cake and pig stomach ?
 oni if chiu blanjar
 morning oredi jiak so heaty liao .
 5 i think is ky
 cant remember when was the last time i had chwee kueh
 their pau is overpriced
 i like the yam too
 bro ,  try eating cakes ,  angmo bread ,  ice cream ,  waffles .
 those gcp foods .
 and show them on edmw .
 its a proven formula .
 one piece 50 cent ?
 so little where got full ?
 if i order chiu kuay ,  i will always ask for more chai  po .
 de cai bor looks goode
 i guess that can be the way to do it .
 no harm trying this .
 singapore‘s it security has ,  in general ,  been really weak for years .
  outsource to mumbai la ,  see what chiu get .
 data leaks ,  insider scams ,  telco sms spams ,  endless calls from +65… .
 they all add up eventually and now chiu have people losing their life savings cos the whole thing is so intricate ,  it’s hard for the general population to discern .
 every agency says it’s not their fault ,  singapore gahment does nothing about it .
  still want to be regional financial hub when their security is so poor .
 i received oni 1 sms on 5 jan .
 it seems they are giving wrong info to the public .
 should have an act to sue the outsource coy .
 100 million compensate for security breech from cognizant hcl .
 they have such capabilities on internet banking front end ,  recording of the personas for every individual *this includes geo location as well as transactional behaviour .
 and ,  by right it should be blocking if suddenly a foreign ip is detected logging in where the actual personas of the individual is always in sg…:: .
 the lapse here is why it is not working/turned on .
 there is no backend ai capabilities to track/show a huge spike going into an overseas account .
 somemore the scammer literally wipe out the whole account .
 the bank is not even asking anything .
 these days its all stp ,  unless its manually track which is expensive
 google has this ip thingy .
 will ask user .
 seems like chiu have login into google using a new ip address ,  email chiu asking if its chiu .
 banks can even check it the new xfer receipt is totally new never seens before .
 ask for confirmation .
 its an anomaly .
 they have it i guess but maybe didnt turned on/not working .
 actually the limit increase without the need for otp is the killer .
 otherwise losses would be limited to oni the daily limit
 if the money is mine ,  its definitely ocbc &apos;s fault .
 if the money is not mine ,  its the user &apos;s fault .
 if ocbc pays me to defend them ,  its whoever they think is their fault .
 while ocbc could have been more proactive and done more to safe guard account holders’ interest .
 the weakest link is still the one holding the phone .
 there are cases where users did nothing .
 money still gone .
 these cases account holder literally did nothing and can do nothing .
 those who click  &apos;no &apos; will get scammed soon and cry
 i received the dbs $20 bicentennial note sms ,  i did click the link to check on the website and key in fake id .
 tried 30min again ,  dbs had oredi blocked the phishing site ,  i dont see this happen to ocbc .
 e banks can definitely do more .
 kinda like it &apos;s  an act of sabo .
 like somethin &apos; where u didnt do it but got accused of
 it takes 2 hands to make a clap
 the oni thing weak is sinkees ,   cannot do anything .
 since nothing to lose ,  why not go aloha those head honchos of the bank & their families .
 just koe how to comprain & go bedok reservior .
 can they at least waive off the $2 admin charge if the bank balance falls below the min requirement ?
 dont worry ,  the bank will send lawyer letter to the receiver if money not return within 3 days
 pester them every 3 days la .
 cannot let them take 1 month .
 this bank is very wols and lousy one .
 they need to be pushed
 if this happen to me ,  pretty sure is my mum supposed to fulfill some obligation but gambled/give away the money and come up with ridiculous excuse .
 lol very hard to justify unless the person willing to credit to chiu back .
 take it as lesson .
 deposit and open eye check account number properly next time .
 i suppose she deposited to someone account before it was logged out ,  that means she inserted her at the moment card after the deposit .
 sound weird but highly likely .
 hence why ,  never let older folks to such stuff unless its online ,  at least can zoom in to see the process .
 and those bank tellers ,  techies and front end developers oso la ,  use so bombarstic engrish for who   .
 just put transfer from my acct to my acct  .
 or transfer deposite to this acct  .
 chiu mean the at the moment system did not “log out” from the previous user’s account ?
 smelly trick like those axs payment machine lor .
 key in liao then purposely go out of way then one blur f go use and tio liao
 scary ,  is that at the moment kena hacked
 yaloh ,  if got insert own at the moment card but $ .
 end up in someone else account .
 better make police report & inform mothership
 got cctv oso got at the moment log mah .
 otherwise just issue lawyer letter to bank .
 for dbs ,  we cannot insert the at the moment card if the previous person left ,  but the at the moment hasn’t ended the session .
 how about uob  ?
 if it’s the same ,  then cctv should be able to prove your mum inserted the card ,  hence should not deposit money into another account .
 wa this is spectacular
 the person must return  .
 it is an offence not to .
 people have been charged for this before .
 but of course the receiver can play the game if knows how to .
 i wont advise how .
 not easy cos you &apos;ll face police pressure .
 but essentially chiu have to return the money if wrongly received .
 lol no lawyer will stupid enough to sent to bank
 few weeks to a month .
 u go ahead and send wrong people and try lor .
 not an offense .
 easy to say bank account didnt check amount .
 if it is an offense  ,  i will just abuse it and sent to anyone i hate then call police liao lor .
 there is your answer
 never double check meh ?
 i thought normally will ask u to confirm
 yes this is true .
 i had such an experience before .
 a chap left his card and i was next wanted to withdraw .
 of course i did the correct thing and exited for him and chased after him to get his card back .
 i oso had another experience lately ,  where a gal left a few notes behind after withdrawing .
 oso called out to her .
 people dont get tempted by such silly things ,  these are all offences if chiu retain/withdraw something that isnt yours .
 criminal misappropriation - 403
 these people really jelly .
 peole use $$ buy the parts ,  people pay for the power as well .
 haha wasting power .
 then gaming not wasting power ?
 watching online video etc .
 personal entertainment not wasting power ?
 talk about environment etc ,  how about smoking ?
 pollution + die of cancer etc .
 why no ban smoking ?
 drunk drivers kill how many oredi ?
 drinking got any health benefits ?
 why not ban alcohol ?
 sp never question u ?
 pay money still want question what ?
 too late to start mining ?
 u see gpu prices here ,  scalpers will take their cut first before u see any profit 
 when can we have dine-in at restaurant ,  food court ,  hawker centre ,  coffee shop ?
 14th june or never again ?
 sick and tired of dabao .
 heng ts not scrabby else sure tio jinxed
 isnt dabao the same as dine in .
 u r eating the food
 no to dine in forever .
 let &apos;s do our part to keep hawker and foodcourt .
 just dabao and go is the best .
 i hope lawremce womg extend the dine in ban until august
 chiu have a point .
  after awhile ,  nea may forget they have a thing called return your tray .
 gobment say will review and not confirm mah .
 scarly ,  increase 5 pax but no dine in how ?
 cause dine in ,  remove mask ,  then up case again .
 gahment never provide free mask that can be use while eating one .
 no more eating ,  no more entertainment .
 just work and pay tax .
 very safe from virus .
 isn’t life wonderful ?
 cant wait to go coffeeshop jiak huazai roast pork 
 ban dine but unban work in office
 count down to bistro-in​
 as long got unlink cases ,  please dont be foolish to unwind p2(ha) measures .
 will require more tightening and more suffering time later on  ?
 ts is silver serpent anot ?
 i dont think the cost will be more than the amount being scammed .
 cannot say ocbc faultless .
 kena nearly 500 scams in 1 month but act blur meh ?
 pap fault for so pro business there is 0 consumer rights here .
 disgusting elites helping themselves get richer .
 businesses like ocbc take advantage of the lax regulations .
 prob that time is holiday period even it pangkang so took so long to block that phishing site
 ownself click on some random link is whose fault ?
 my transaction all fingerprint oni ,  and i oni use the app ,  never in a browser .
 as much as i think the victims are at fault but bank oso cannot escape it &apos;s responsibility
 click link is user fault .
 people notice money transfer out call ocbc but no-one pick up n stop the transfer is ocbc fault .
 money gone due to we call them but they unable no response so conclusions is ocbc fault .
 please payback money
 see the cast vote .
 really like the 60 plus percent who vote for it and kaopei .
 click link is user fault .
  but the incident response by ocbc clearly shows that it is not up to par    
 ocbc just has very poor security protocols in place .
 if chiu continue to put money there it defeats the whole purpose of keeping money safe in a bank .
 the vote count like pappy supporters
 if all the 400+ cases occurred within a very short period ,  then bo bian ,  not really much ocbc can do .
 but if the scam has been going on for quite a while ,  ocbc really should have done something earlier already
 no ,  it’s always ahtc fault .
 last time there is a official ocbc member in edmw .
 dunno why haven come out edmw clarify yet ?
 edmw oredi do the poll for your bank .
 can see people not happy here !
 your boss still dont want do anything ah ?
 partly to blame
 maybe their boss say radio silence until they know what is going on    
 all bank should have a quick way to freeze own account for such case .
 knn 23yo still young la ,  im 32yo never had gf before
 maybe not in the next few years .
 pull down mask chua sai .
 actually ,  getting a girl is not complicated .
 for some lucky people it comes naturally .
 for the rest it takes work .
 it &apos;s not easy .
 but if chiu want it enough chiu can get a gf ,  or at any rate a girl who &apos;s genuinely into chiu .
 marriage is another story .
 auntie staying home everyday waiting for my handsome oppa to one fine day drop into my home oni .
 make me feel like a playboy ,  play around with different girls ,  but dont feel pain when i break up .
 being said ,  i told myself not be so hopeful ,  can find jiu good lor ,  if not life still goes on .
 oredi know what type of girl i like ,  in terms of characteristics & personality ,  parents & friends can accept & acknowledge the girl im dating ,  able to cook & keep fit is +1
 chiu should be doing exactly what chiu are doing right now .
 keep churning gfs .
 chiu are on the right track .
 this is what i did .
 then when chiu get sick and tired of being sick and tired ,  this is when chiu know chiu are ready to settle down .
 this is how chiu know she is the one .
 there is one more important reason .
 when married ,  chiu will be more determined to never look at another women again .
 after all ,  chiu have oredi  &apos;been there and done that &apos; .
 chiu know how it ends .
 then chiu will be more determined to work on your marriage .
 not look for alternatives .
 many married men philander cos they married their 1st or 2nd gfs .
 when things go awry - and marriage is seldom smooth - they dont have your experience to draw from .
 they  &apos;itch &apos; for other women .
 this is how marriages break down and how their children suffer .
 she can suck my helium gaogao
 you’re those quite insecure and quiet guys is it ?
 23 yo oni woo 3 girls is quite little .
 just use dating apps and cast your net .
 ask friend intro girls oso can .
 quiet yes…i am generally very introverted unless i know chiu well .
 in terms of insecurity ,  i guess it might be that vibe that i gave the 3rd girl that’s why she grew tired of me .
 any tips or suggestions ?
 i tried all the different dating apps le (cmb ,  tinder ,  okc ,  tantan) but feel like they are either 1 .
 very superficial 2 .
 what chiu have severely omitted is that this group of girls are statistically unattractive by proportion to the entire dating pool of girls available 
 what your height ?
 go hr can find le .
 wait ,  chiu must earn more than them first .
 serve 2 years ns .
 loss of income is 48k to 200k for guys lol .
 truly a privilege .
 most likely will tio hiam by them .
 just take time ah .
 earn the money and find someone within 5 years younger than chiu .
 most importantly ,  dont be too despo ah .
 no single mothers and above 30 peeps
 80 percent wants the top 20/5 percent mah .
 in tinder ,  it &apos;s all about looks mah .
 never about your personality .
 23 is still young sia why so emo so early ?
 there are guys in 40s here still unmarried
 i personally do not use any dating apps ,  but i know people who have found long term relationships on them .
 so imo ,  it’s not the app ,  but how chiu sieve through all your scammers and nonsense people who are wasting your time .
 i would like to believe that there are genuine people on the app who are trying to find long term partners there .
 i guess with all these “distractions” ,  y’all are finding it hard to find each other .
 i think in order to lose the superficial feeing ,  chiu need to form genuine connection as friends first .
 this is probably the hardest part through dating apps .
 since you’re still studying ,  it is probably much easier to forge genuine friendships in school instead ,  then see if anyone can click with chiu and can develop to be more than friends .
 this is oso why it’s much easier to find relationships in schools than in work places ,  since the latter oso has more politics and individual competition .
 that being said ,  there are people who have oso found love in workplaces (non-cheating case) .
 put yourself out there ,  take the risk ,  be vulnerable ,  and play the game .
 precisely ,  by that very post he has totally destroyed every shred of credibility that his advice or whatsoever has provided previously  .
 really doing a disservice to the younger generation of males in singapore ,  reported to mod 
 chiu have a gf leh !
 her name is call covid 19 ,  she is 19 years old and love chiu until died !
 and she will forever with chiu and accompany chiu to hell too !
 but recently ,  she found out chiu are seeing 2 ladies name pfizer and moderna ,  and gf feels sad leh .
 dont break her heart bro .
 u no career no condo no car .
 u wan which girl to like u
 parents being able to feed them is one of the reasons ,  the other is that they know life is too short to be stuck in a job that they would be unhappy in .
 working and work-related activities take up at least 1/3 of their day .
 notice period is one month or 3 months ?
 oni toxic people can thrive in toxic environment .
 like how gut bacteria can thrive in the rectum .
 he local anot got gone through ns anot
 he dont have to give him problem .
 just need to say or show how tough or bad the environment or the job itself etc ,  will have lot of shts or whoever difficult work with etc .
 or maybe dont even need to ,  your junior engineer on job working probably saw or felt it .
 if the person lacks of experience or not his preference to such working style or people ,  ya most likely he wont waste time n zhao .
 that means your pay to him is not attractive enough
 chiu very naive to think this way  .
 best way is tekan till the new guy cmi and auto leave ,  he will be the last man standing and who knows he will be considered to be promoted and take up the higher role when chiu guys cannot find any better candidate .
 just ask your boss post on jobstreet la .
 5k salary alot fresh grade and even experience sinkies will apply .
 last time my company post within 2 weeks 80++ cvs came in  .
 must state first mah .
 own conti before ,  if not how to join the conti bash bandwagon ?
 but oni can afford sibei old conti .
 leave this detail out purposely 
 oni one rule: .
 if want conti ,  please buy brand new
 and sell away before 5 year is up .
 yup as cars get older or have more mileage .
 wear and tear like bearings and seals will wear off causing blow by and oil consumption .
  can switch to slightly thicker engine oils if notice oil consumption going up , if not planning to overhaul .
 these oils may form some kind of a plug effect to narrow the leak but not always 100% .
 why conti cars so lousy ?
 i intend to buy conti coe cars .
 better than 2nd hand jap cars !
 in before top up a bit for .
 paging for sammiegirl for more insight .
 my previous audi drive 10 years until scrap no major problems leh ,  just wear and tear replacement and tighten engine mounting .
 see luck and how u drive
 under our weather and humidity = problematic cars .
 japan has seasons like european countries .
 japan &apos;s winter no less harsh than europe &apos;s .
 hard truth is that japanese cars build quality is far better
 oso wear n tear is expensive for premium conti
 fleet of toy cars .
 the problems are vicious cycle .
 is truth that once chiu goes conti chiu dont go back jap .
 however ,  i go back jap just so i can buy super big item .
 the feel of torque and speed when chiu step the accelerator .
 na jap cars cant compare .
 even right now after 1 year back in jap car .
 still cant kick the habit of the  step accelerator torque and speed expectation .
 now i step nia .
 the next moment i release .
 can hear engine zrooming sound very nice but car no move as expectation .
 i &apos;ve owned and driven extensively conti ,  kimchi and jap .
 jap certainly is more reliable .
 but contis just bring a smile to your face when driving .
 doctors that fear no work life balance
 need to reinstate their suspended doctors to help out
 why they so stoooopig wan ?
 dunno how to make field hospitals ah .
 maybe they lazy to watch over so many measures .
 pinoy doc must be thinking heng he kena fired from his job or else now he have handle all this sheet 
 could it be the ratio per population is low in the first place ,  especially for icu ?
 can talk about everything in punggol .
 where is the nicest czechar ?
 i like crab master best .
 which part of punggol is the most beautiful ?
 i dont live there
 punggol is nice .
 shame about the people there .
 is all i want to say .
 here nothing good has been said about punggol leh .
 chiu know punggol got rental flat ?
 anyone tried punggol nasi lemak ?
 not at kovan meh ?
 no wonder i can’t find after up and down
 end up i ate lasagna in punggol again
 in before  &apos;dont be areacism &apos; .
 must be inclusive of the whole of sinkapore
 all playgrounds ,  basketball courts overrun by ceca
 not that true la .
 where chiu live
 alot of low ses strawberry staying there .
 i oni know punggol park is in hougang
 got the singapore canal of venice .
 dont talk cock .
 chiu live with your parents right ?
 oredi sold the lous bto low ses place and moved to town
 punggol is the son of malaysia
 take medicine first then chiu realise chiu still living in your parent house
 there is an indian international school in punggol hence there are  .
 1) alot of entry to mid level (5k to 15k per individual) white collared talents staying at hdb in punggol .
 2) there are company provided buses from punggol to cbp for a number of banks and tech companies .
 3) with the upcumming tech park in punggol ,  chiu can expect more delta talents .
 we are cecapore ,  cecawhoreans
 straight through process… .
 u need humans to eye ball manual transactions ?
 its easy for chiu or anyone to say but the cost to implement will be high .
 everyday there is 60k-100k of transactions .
 operations budget are very tight .
 can see results are like pappies vs oppo erection .
 mummy &apos;s fren just comed over and she buyed a gift over ,  telled us we can unwrap now and eated ,  then moi unwrapped and sawed it &apos;s ferrero rocher chocolate ,  jin disappointed  
 ferraro is low ses auntie buy one .
 now is give royce ,  godiva and laderach
 got ferro better than none
 [very disappointed] no pic thread again
 …first world problem
 still a decent chocolate treat
 moi neber heard of this laderach brand before .
 means moi is low ses ?
 ferraro rocher jhj
 huh very good liao leh
 maybe left over from lunar seven month
 if really see chiu no up ,  would have given chiu van houten or kitkat .
 … your mother friend got dotter ?
 very disappointed with your “buyed”
 this ts is the new yak chin ?
 every 5 min got new stupid thread
 looks like i need to upgrade my goodies .
 i always offer that to my relatives .
 got rocher to jiak still better than me  .
 me jiak 4 days old ang ku kueh
 damn low crass…
 its the thought that count .
 can dont give chiu anything
 i got use uob deposit machine i oso catch no ball how is this possible .
 the moment the screen asks what else chiu want to do ?
 if chiu exit take out at the moment card the receipt is ejected and the welcome screen shows liao .
 i really catch no ball how come the previous user’s account is retained in memory .
 ts i not totally convinced by your mother &apos;s story .
 better to verify again .
 old people are forgetful .
 check see the money is send to india or .
 im asking if anyone had encounter such issue which bank holds chiu up 1 whole month to investigate .
 by then the cctv recording likely would have been overwritten .
 old people might have blur blur keyed in wrong option but explained to son otherwise .
 happen many times before .
 maybe that machine card reader has been rigged .
 no matter whose card u insert ,  it will always go to a specific account .
 then very scary .
 if take out at the moment card means logout ,  it should never happen .
 i can’t imagine what other innocent error could happen .
 recently got overseas buggy telco allowing sms to be diverted for fraudulent credit card charges .
 criminals are getting more and more sophisticated .
 chiu can key in other people &apos;s account number .
 which is the concern some of the records or even cctv video may be overwritten .
 by they raise this incident initially as if my mom fault to transfer wrongly and need to request receiving account holder to agree the transfer back .
 but pretty sure with at the moment card inserted it would be a system error for another account .
 ps: uob automatic deposit machine dunnid pin number to deposit cash .
 not like dbs (which is cos it give chiu option to deposit and withdraw)
 to be honest ,  this is such a weird situation that 99% of people have trouble believing .
 i advise to make police report to force uob to expedite .
 my guess is on their end they oso don’t really believe your story
 the police is not edmw .
 statement taking is not just ask 1 or 2 question ,  chiu answer correctly case closed .
 they will ask a number of background questions .
 they will look at cctv footage of chiu ,  the person before chiu and after .
 cctv/transactions for banks there s a law must keep for 6 years i believe .
 ok so once chiu did a genuine mistake ,  that one can kao tim ,  but repeatedly do it ?
 i had a friend who received money wrongly and spent it .
 but he knew how to answer .
 he escaped the charge but it was just a one off and the amount wasn &apos;t large .
 but the bank notified him that he would have to return the money and he agreed .
 if he said no ,  after the fact has been proven that it wasn &apos;t his money he would be charged .
 but chiu can take some time to return it .
 but large amounts no excuse .
 grab went to wrongly credit 250k into a guy &apos;s account ,  he act blur refused to return even a bit .
 he was later charged .
 sentences will depend on amount ,  250k will easily get a year or more .
 how can this be possible
 cannot be put in own card & key in own pin and money goes to another person &apos;s acct .
 unless is during deposit ts &apos; mom went to choose deposit into someone else &apos;s acct & manually keyed in that person &apos;s acct no .
 unless it’s personally key in the acct ,  there’s a possibility of kyng a wrong acct number… .
 cannot singapore banking laws make it clear must keep for a minimum no of years and if no reports then oni can delete/overwrite
 reminds me a time ,  use a bank app .
 kyn my own user name and password ,  keep getting into other person account .
 login again and it displays other people account details .
 skimmer is steal your card info .
 totally different from what ts is describing
 honestly hard to believe the story .
 chiu dont be surprise alot of people do that
 i am not surprised ,  but come to think of it ,  we dont exactly know how this covid virus is spreading ,  on the surface that have been contacted ?
 no one knows for sure what kind of evolution the virus is going through .
 all we know is that the virus is super infectious and is now spreading like wild fire .
 this guy shows his face and the company uniform .
 he was wearing mask in preparation of the noodle and take off mask after packing ,   there is no one around oso .
 bro ,  look carefully ,  the one preparing and the one packing are 2 different person .
 this is not about stirring ,  we have to safeguard singapore ,  our home .
 people are doing whatever we can so that this pandemic can be over .
 it oni takes a few individuals to spoil everything .
 please report it to the relevant authorities
 i see the local or don’t know msians or whatever eating inside stall .
 customer order with them when they have no mask on face (one side on ear) then they proceed to make drinks .
 another is not wearing any doing pancakes .
 i oso saw the indian chef wearing mask but liked exposed underwear see his nose n beard .
 i think is singapore indian .
 so if u think oni fw u r wrong .
 or the young chaps in restaurant kitchen not wearing any masks !
 eating in kitchen !
 or the cashier not wearing mask n eating at counter .
 they should be sitting at customer place to eat not eat at their station
 haiz ,  all these cant be helped .
 this one is a little too blatantly doing things .
 youncan see from his other tiktok videos ,  the number of people he mingled with during his off days are .
 i am not against him meeting up with people and shooting tiktok videos ,  but he should do it outside his workplace whereby the products are being supplied to the masses .
 which authority to report to ?
 feedback - sfa .
 arrest ,  cane and deport .
 oni factory workers dont wear mask ?
 i thought they are everywhere now
 lulz ,  i predicted spread by public toilet .
 alot of people go toilet pang sai no wear mask
 true true ,  they are everywhere .
 but for this case ,  the noodles will be delivered to singaporean &apos;s primary dining source .
 the repercussion will be very great if he somehow has contact with the virus somewhere .
 he can do it once ,  cant guarantee that he will not do it again .
 chiu think inside resturant and hawker  .
 always wear mask  or wear properly ?
 oso not cooked food leh .
 u mean u don’t wash the noodle then straightaway cook it ?
 aiyah ever since mask wearing became compulsory ,  i have even seen it in restaurants .
 then again who am i to judge ?
 it’s hot enugh being in the kitchen even without mask .
 of course that’s why covid spreads .
 chiu all dont be a poosy .
 scared this scared that .
 that why asians more inferior to angmos and angmos are dunno .
 they continued living their life .
 chiu see europe and usa .
 got any serious repercussions ?
 where can i buy fresh banmian liddat as a consumer ?
 they pay so much money go poly ,  the knowledge not relevant to be hired ?
 either way pap has failed the nation .
 doesn’t matter which u blame when the root cause is the same
 unfair hiring practices  .
 not moe issue ,  even if u gahave the skills ,  companies will lowball u
 how u know is the salary kena low ball or just everything else over priced ?
 ts dont understand ?
 nothing to do with education ,  its the unfairness (kaki nang hire kaki nang) and they come in truckloads
 u have people like lesson paying peanuts to get uni level grads and expecting poly people to know uni leveel stuff  .
 pay peanuts and expect alot
 in the past ,  the society was engineered so that there is no overabundance of of graduates or a group with certain specific skills .
 all of a sudden ,  there is a shortage of skills/talents .
 nobody should be blamed .
 did chiu see pritam blame anybody yesterday ?
 if even the leader of the opposition did not oppose ,  then what &apos;s the problem ?
 ceca has no authority nor any clause in it that can bypass mom to allow anyone to work in singapore .
 mom has the final say on their work permit applications .
 so why is even ceca involved ?
 u miss out landlord scream for rental income and property appreciation
 ns for sinkies .
 ceca dont think so .
 ceca will bang table and slap singapore if not allowing more ceca in
 its proven that ceca allow more ceca work and play in singapore .
 didnt our minister has oredi clarify that it is not the case ?
 report liddat is proof that we are not letting them in as they like .
 so moving on ,  we just need our opposition to check on them on this issue .
 isnt that what they are for in the first place ?
 then send your evidence to psp .
 so that they can bring it out in their coming motion if any .
 eip more important ok .
 it’s not easy to immigrate  .
 especially now  !
 yes blame our education system for not teaching us how to sell snake oil .
 some more he paid in full cos he wanted the credit card points and now he has to tell his guests they cannot go and then hotel refuse to refund or even upgrade the menu sia .

 the hotel is a quite atas hotel in orchard area sia .
 he oso kena stun when hotel say no refund or upgrades  .
 maybe can ,  but my monthly not high la .
 so dont wear so big swimming trunks
 why cant refund ?
 service not provided no ?
 why do we want to hold a banquet for 25 tables ?
 are all of those 250 people there really happy for chiu ?
 i would rather just invite close family and friends to a max of 2 tables at a nice restaurant for a meal and scoot off to a month-long honeymoon
 dont think fren telling him the whole true ba
 if is good credit card company with excellent customer protection policy and service .
 he should contact his cc company immediately .
 if is uob just be happy they never ask to take more money from you
 then open 25 tables and perform social distancing with 2 to 3 pax per table then .
 or dabao the food and pass it to others .
 tiagong hotel cannot make this arrangement .
 wa when he call me today to say i cannot go he sound sibei sad sia
 dabao the food give to dormitory
 waiting for your tips

 but i think your view is severely flawed .
 here is my data .
 i was never single since 16 .
 i am not good looking .
 i rate my looks as 6 .
 neither am i tall or successful in my career (i .
 but i have countless gfs and partners .
 from air stewardess to secretaries to bankers .
 most 8/10 to 10/10 in the looks department .
 i can tell chiu they can easily find better looking and richer guys .
 yet they prefer fugly me .
 in fact ,  dont flame me ,  my problem is the opposite of many here .
 too many women .
 it threatens my marriage .
 up until a few months  ago ,  there were 2 more ladies that crossed my life .
 i wont go into the details .
 very attractive ladies with no lack of suitors .
 i turned both down .
 and i am at a ripe old age of 50 now !
 cos (decent) ladies are more attracted to whats inside a man .
 not outer appearances .
 no offence ,  if chiu cant eat sweet grapes ,  i can understand chiu will say the grape is sour .
 or conclude there are no such thing as sweet grapes .
 i reckon women are like a supermarket .
 there will always be many types of products available .
 chiu are probably looking in the wrong section too .
 so chiu conclude that  &apos;such girls are statistically unattractive by proportion to the entire dating pool of girls available &apos; .
 the truth is ,  if chiu know how to polish whats inside chiu ,  they will come in the truckloads .
 ts please go buy a mirror and look at own self in mirror .
 you &apos;ll thank yourself when chiu see your friends start going through divorce and child custody proceedings .
 meanwhile ,  all your wealth belongs to just chiu .
 when u post like this .
 y no mention what type u looking for ?
 maybe convert to bi ,  then got more choices to find ghey oso lor
 your mommy will always love chiu .
 i think so too 
 whats the group called ?
 give chiu a chance .
 chiu want date me or not ?
 moi 30+ yo still havent hold hand or pika before ,  u kiasimi ?
 edmw bbfas is always here for chiu  .
 better be prepared for next 30 years of singlehood n focus chiur energies on other things
 why chiu spend so much time 1 hr on the treadmill ?
 given your age of 23 ,  that’s not going to do anything .
 chiu need to quickly start doing the weights as soon as possible to see visible results .
 if chiu are scare of free weight ,  even the machine ones oso will give chiu result .
 walking around for 1 hr on treadmill is just wasting time for chiu .
 though i dunno chiu i’m just assume chiu are healthy .
 spend less time on edmw  .
 then u will get a gf
 chiu think people who are attached or getting married found love ?
 not all though ,  some found companionship ,  some found breakup/divorce .
 50% of marriages cmi ,  the remaining tahan each other .
 imagine compromising with someone the rest of your life ,  just to have a companion .
 chiu will never fulfill your full potential .
 but why scared ?
 it’s not unforeseeable isn’t it ?
 hospitals all collapsing now ,  cant deal with imported cases also
 sinkies gg this direction isn’t it .
 gong xi gong xi
 yea i know ,  but i don’t understand .
 if they believed it to be endemic ,  surely they expected people to get infected right ?
 just let the virus run free ,  no ?
 the gahment stupid la ,  covid local cases still on the rise yet wants to go ahead open to tourists .
 prostitute singapore still dying to spread her legs
 its a bad idea  ,  deltas is very strong
 anyone with a brain knows it will fail from the get go .
 they just trying their luck .
 hoping for the best .
 but not prepared for the worst .
 meanwhile singapore gahment want to live life like endemic .
 should measure icu cases instead .
 countries that don’t take covid seriously should be dealt a lesson they will never forget .
 so it covid numbers never come down countries remain shut forever  ?
 yah lor i dont see any alternative if your economy is dependent on tourism or intl trade .
 tourism is like what 30% of the thai economy .
 30% gone means millions of jobs gone ,  millions no food to eat .
 they dunnid any pilot program if they study our imported cases .
 “put in place a temporary ban on tourists leaving hotels” .
 lol simi lanjiao ,  local population got spread ,  tourists end up getting shafted ?
 some people for some inexplicable reason just seem to want borders to remain shut forever .
 they should not look at the numbers .
 thai needs oyk .
 all ceca chiong there with fake vaccination certs ?
 sure will make sure the healthcare system there collapse .
 open some more .
 overseas exchange programmes and internships are key to equipping our students to thrive in a globalised world .
 as part of efforts to enhance the international exposure of our students ,  the youth interns exchange scheme (yes) was jointly established by ministry of education ,  singapore and the ministry of human resources and social security (mhrss) of cheena in october 2019 .
 originally scheduled to be launched last year ,  the scheme was delayed due to the #covid pandemic .
 but we remain undeterred and the implementation agreement was signed by singapore’s ambassador to cheena his excellency lui tuck yew on moe’s behalf and mhrss’ vice minister mr chiu jun this week in beijing .
 yes will help about 500 full-time students and recent graduates from polytechnics and autonomous universities from singapore and the equivalent from cheena ,  to participate in overseas internships in our two countries .
 our students can look forward to updates on internship opportunities in cheena on the yes website (yes .
 sg) when travel resumes .
 what about india ?
 shouldn &apos;t we foster ties and cultural understanding at an early age there too ,  especially as lhl is an early believer .
 oyk ,  when he was moe ,  wanted to send kiddos to india .
 so what is the outcome ?
 another jinx project ?
 hoho means more ceca to fill the position here
 to cater for singapore pr a legitimate route to go back cheena and never come bk ?
 cheena is the best !
 who in their right mind wants to do internship in cheena ?
 996 stressful lifestyle on top of food , air safety concerns .
 our innocent buey gan youngsters go cheena to get makan alive ah
 i assume chiu are an ethnic chinese sinkie so maybe chiu are not interested in india ,  but how sure are chiu that indian sinkies are not ?
 cheena is where my ancestors came from ,  so i have some interest in that country .
    but chiu dont expect an indian sinkie to have the same interest in cheena ,  from a cultural and historical pov .
  it is oni logical that his affinity is for chennai if he is a tamil sinkie .
 and not for xiamen or guangzhou or swatow .
 sinkie girls scare go there ,  .
 sinkie guys wont want their prostitutes .
 go tiongland better .
 can find prostitutes mls fls standard better than what is available from boss sam &apos;s stables domes
 i wont be surprised at least a few thousand parents would be interested in this .
  i am being conservative cos it might be tens of thousands .
 are chiu sure sinkiebu scared ?
  chiu need to mix around outside more leh .
  alot of sinkiebu are now dating ceca hor .
  they work in banks and it together ,  and then love blooms .
 the rest is up to your imagination what they do in the bedroom lor .
 please la ,  doesnt matter what race ,  sinkies will oni want to go angmo countries .
 cos cheena is no longer behind singapore ,  it is far far ahead .
 of course there are still banana cheena haters who are behind the times .
 can tell this is spoken by mountain tortoise who have never worked with cheena mncs
 next time we go cheena work as coolie liao .
 our forefather will be proud of us .
 while ceca come here earn big buck
 how come sinking girls scared to go there ?
 thought they like dhalsims alot ?
 or maybe she accidentally saved another &apos;s account number by error and then deposited there .
 but i forget even though i have 2 uob cards ,  i think uob deposit by card no need key in pin no .
 just deposit oni .
 but i forget if this is true .
 never pay attention to such things .
 alot of people pull down their mask while talking on their phone inside bus or mrt .
 hate this type of irresponsible people .
 scared stay at home .
 im sorry about other people
 very muffled talking lah
 take their photo and send to sda lor .
 ask them fine them goood good
 i oso pull it down to hide 1 corner makan
 eating not the same mah
 these should be fined
 seen some pulled down their masks to sneeze ,  multiple sneezes at a time .
 yup i note it too
 have chiu seen people walk and smoke ?
 yup ,  seen many times
 u must be one of them .
 wear mask under chin or nose
 i just take them off .
 eating drinking dunnid wear mask .
 brisk walking dunnid wear mask .
 just hold a drink or some food n go about your daily business .
 why need to do that leh ?
 the phone mic can pick up alot of sound one  .
 unless those kum gong wear a mini mask for their fat farking face that squeeze against their lips
 so far office meeting many wear mask and talk still can catch what they say .
 today one pinoy lady call .
 i use alot of brain juice trying to understand what hospitalisation plan she talking about .
 before my brain fried i told her not i not interested .
 and she kept yapping and yapping .
 i had to tell her i have to end the call .
 cos our mrt the world noisest ,  the system announcement repeatedly with 4 different languages kept over swarm normal conversation ,  u should ask authority mrt operators cut down the high volume long winded announcement from suspicious article to trace together bullshiiittt
 heng i no friends .
 so no need talk on phone
 read the article .
 its  from ceca mouth
 huai never find out tooth and ask parent whu they voted first ?
 how to blame moe ?
 we have high ranking uni & cambridge paper .
 so how do uptron & spu got jobs that sinkies would be qualified to do so ?
 blame pap not moe .
 vote pap out for better future without ceca
 i blame my parents .
 why give birth to me 
 i think if u trace back to the root of the issue then u should blame your parents
 its really those companies who do such things
 instead of learning programming skills in young age we have useless subjects like social study .
 moe didnt have the foresight led to this mass import of ceca for it
 in before blame ownself
 moe has a part to play too
 after more than 10 years and we still importing .
 meaning nothing is improved
 your transcripts is snake oil proof
 in exchange of investments ?
 blame both ,  so who is responsible for it
 same reason why edmwers blame sinkie girls when their cog smol
 ministry of trade and industry has a role to play too
 on the onset of covid ,  during the glorious day of gahment declaring no sick no need mask ,  almost non of our food handlers wear mask .
 no outbreak leh .
 chiu tik many homebased food sellers got wear mask oso meh
 those inside restaurant and hawker stall ,  the spread is contained within the premises and the spread can be contained and slow down with the trace together app/token .
 can the bags of noodles be traced ?
 v edmwer thing to do .
 actually if u walking around the dom at night ,  can see alot of foreign workers nearby chillax not wear mask properly
 those walking around the dorm unmasked ,  even if they have confirmed case ,  it will be contained within the compound itself .
 stirring to protect our countrymen .
 if situation gets worse here ,  they always have a choice to go back to their homeland ,  whereas ordinary sinkie like us have to suck thumb and stay on .
 waseh ,  want so serious boh ?
 arrest and deport is good enough liao ,  still cane ah .
 cane to give him souvenir to bring home ?
 hr bo do work lor
 ya right ,  continue living their normal lives ,  but we have not seen the aftermath of  &apos;freedom &apos; .
 the time is just not ripe yet .
 chiu mean chiu washed your noodles before cooking it ?
  and the packaging may be in contact with the virus .
 for that chiu will never know cos nobody will disinfect plastic packaging .
 wet market stall selling tofu/noodles should have .
 i saw one cook putting the meat ingredients in a stretch of bowls probably ard 15 bowls .
 after that he stacked one after another put beside the boiling water container easy for him to cook for each order .
 this is quite similar to the tzechar stall practice .
 this is done to increase efficiency .
 as long as they dont give chiu that bowl to hold your food is considered good oredi .
 put himself in trouble  
 what kind of trouble has he put himself into ?
 sinkies not hygienic la .
 we are a cleaned city not a clean one
 everyone please do it ,  if 1 person report maybe the authority heck care ,  but many many report ,  they cant turn a blind eye on this .
 i have oredi reported .
 myanmar ban mian anyone ?
 the british citizens stranded in kabul - podcast .
 day after day ,  ahmad risked his life to come to the airport with his family ,  british passport in hand – oni to be left behind when the last evacuation flight departed .
 now he and many others who hoped to be rescued face an uncertain future in the new afghanistanahmad – not his real name – left afghanistan after the us invasion began in 2001 .
 he sought asylum in the uk ,  and eventually settled in glasgow ,  finally becoming a citizen last year .
 but his wife and children live in kabul .
 in august ,  with his wife heavily pregnant ,  he flew back to be with them ,  believing there would be time to bring them back to the uk if anything went wrong .
 but the baby was born even as the taliban began to seize control of afghanistan’s cities .
 when the capital fell ,  ahmad ,  armed with an email from the british gahment calling him forward ,  came with his family to the airport ,  in hope of a flight out .
 now he and many others who hoped to be rescued face an uncertain future in the new afghanistan .

 surprised no one said this: .

 then ask them dabao the other half and deliver to those not attending .
 the rest 150 can be reserved and consume later
 is it mandarin orchard or grand hyatt ?
 he can always divorce and let me take over .

 and must sing  &apos;celebration ,  it surrounds us ,  every sinkie ,  all around us &apos; .
 woah ,  oh ,  oh ,  oh ,  oh .
 woah ,  oh ,  oh ,  oh ,  oh
 it may be 30 percent in terms of gdp but it’s effect is much greater in terms of employment esp in some areas .
 phuket for eg .
 the domestic  service  sectors are dependent on income which follows indirectly into the sector ie locals who spend money having earned them in the tourism sector .
 hence their desperation at opening up ,  there is simply no alternative .
 people are relying on charities for meals .
 kids are going to school hungry
 their lady boy jialat .
 close border la .
 the sandbox project is really doomed to fail
 such a small island open up to tourists without quarantine since what .
 now not even 1 month .
 have to close down the program liao .
 instead of tourists go there spend money .
 now these tourists go there hog up the medical infrastructure of the small island .
 then what will happen to the islanders there when they kena the virus too ?
 left to die in own house ?
 what more to expect for a small could try to endemic and open up to the world without quarantine .
 see how fast will toh .
 ya probably hitting hospital capacity then reactive .
 can they seek oyk advice and guidance  .
 number of cases does not matter
 pretty sure they know its coming .
 fly jinx ong over to fix their mentality
 iirc the phuket population rely mostly on sinovac vaccine  .
 this vaccine not so effective against delta variant
 it really was for them ,  they think vaccine is magical ,  can mean covid-free .
 actually hospital capacity oso not for politicians to decide .
 they should be asking hospital directors and doctors
 it &apos;s simple: get rid of the virus then open up .
 otherwise chiu end up with this unnecessary unending escalating cycle .
 should track death cases la .
 @singapore gahment please look at this
 at least they tried .
 no more thailand for the next 5 years .
 heng i go thailand is to buy gold nia .
 go those qb house and kcuts lor
 business bad thus no surcharge
 learn to cut own hair now .
 dont like wear mask and book in advance to a hair cut .
 the salons charges extra 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after
 means actually no need surcharge but want to squeeze u dry dry .
 moi still poor so become hairy n go after cny   .
 great ,  fuck them & their cny surcharge  .
 why reduce when all struck in this small island ?
 people no money to cut hair this cny ?
 all spent on extra virgin olive oil .
 max usually hair cut is increased by neighbourhood stalls  ,  now i mostly go  those 10-12 cuts  ,  sometimes they cut 6 dollor oni  ,  can can
 there are still hair salons with no surcharge if chiu bother to look for them .
 if hair svc all x 2 during cny ,  might as well go malls to do
 ownself shave can liao lor
 i dont mind pay but i hate they spend 30min just to cut a normal high slope .
 in 30yrs ago katong pointers oni takes 5min
 need to cut public hair
 and chiu pay for all the cruise ,  expenses chiu feel very lugi ,  how to hint to her chiu want it ?
 asking for a friend by the way .
 if she dont want then ask other &apos;s gf
 maybe she dowan cos got lai ang  ?
 find out about it .
 but if no lai ang ,  no excuse .
 find another gf .
 don’t think too much
 good investment take time to roi
 bring her to staircase to piak !
 so u date her just to piak piak ?
 got give oredi considered lucky
 no piak piak ,  isit cos shanghai uncle oso on same cruise  
 but before cruise she keep tease by asking chiu accompany her to buy bikini and went for ipl waxing .
 surely it means piak piak was in the plan right ?
 pass your room key to a random ceca they know what to do
 pop some champagn ,  give roses .
 can maybe can start foreplay liao
 if u eh gan ,  dont want oso will become want .
 hello all expenses paid leh exp what more did she want ?
 piak piak can do anywhere anytime .
 need to go cruise one meh ?
 cruise ship got shopping alley selling luxury goods .

 if need to ask then dont bother .
 sinkies go cheena to piak atb xmm leh .
 india got atb xmm to piak bo ?
 dhalsim good leh .
 can extend his limbs and other parts long long
 so this one is the prc students who take scholarship to study at nus/ntu etc ,  sign up to sexchange back to cheena for internship ?
 cheena sexchange not so popular ,  but still 500 slots should be easy enough to fill up
 and blow fire all the time .
 seeing his face irks me .
 whacked him harder whenever my character travels to **** land to face him .
 best is can teleport to the back and give a good kick with extended legs .
 jin songs sials can go cheena find atb !
 i think once they experience the cheena 996 work culture through the internship there ,  they will truly appreciate singapore work culture more when they come back .
 dont forget 1sgd is 5rmb .
 the workers there are paid peanuts compared to here in singapore .
 unless they are an expat working there at expat rate ,  no sane person will downgrade their lifestyle to work in cheena and earn lesser .
 so i think is good that they can go there to know what a working hell looks like .
 sinkie go there to work in bed nia .
 free one who dowan .
  salary can be negligible la .
 let’s not be narrow minded and if chiu have the opportunities for overseas work ,  please go for the experience .
 just make sure salary ,  etc is right .
 chiu will be surprise at the kind of opportunities chiu might get when chiu return .
 go there tio lape n scammed ?
 train more ccp comrades .
 why cheena and not india ?
 singapore has ceca arrangement with india no ?
 if its cheena cos its the near future gateway to the world then why not  &apos;ceca &apos; equivalent arrangement with cheena instead of india ?
 it makes no sense that we import this many indian pmets into singapore and yet our workforce do benefit from india !
 what are the benefits of ceca india ?
 get beaten up then raped ?
 atb de cp jhj

 5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill for overall warm up and getting your heart rate up is enough .
 chiu need to build up muscle by doing weights training to burn more calories .

 where is he now… no gps meh
 sigh very sad for kimchi kor kor
 salute him ,  he died in  pursuing what he believes in knowing his disability is against him ( i am sure he is aware the danger) .
 so many examples for us to follow yet we choose to do it differently
 even if they dont uplorry from covid they will uplorry from poverty/bankruptcy
  objective of the vaccination programme is precisely to prevent collapse of our medical infrastructure .
  with vaccination ,   just recover at home if kena covid
 this is an example of not having high vaccination rates .
 not apple to apple
 can always come singapore .
 pap lub all fts n tourists
 they should follow our lead to declare total victory and make it an endemic la .
 no monitor no headache !
 exactly sinkies dunno how fortunate they are to have oyk .
 the second coming of ah gong for us… .
 no more income for the jet ski scam
 friend told me 4 people were tested postive for covid yesterday when they arrived in koh samui .
 2 were thai with 1 az jab and the other 2 are europeans with 2 jabs of pfzier .
 the lucky thing is samui sandbox so far has less than 100 oversea tourist since the 15th july .
 most freedom centric admk will want to have fun that’s why open up phuket for them .
 it’s sad to see end up get quarantined in hotel can’t go out ,  cos i think they really don’t care they will just cheong everywhere if chiu let them .
 local gahment probably more worried about local people that’s why the closure .
 if continue to open ,  sure alot of people not scare die one cheong phuket until high death rate .
 local hospital how big oni ,  can save so many people meh .
 between economy and human life ,  we witnessed the history has always chosen one side ,  cos no one can take care of chiu or your family forever except yourself .
 if not open up ,  die ,  open up oso die .
 might as well .
 open up and let the stronger ones live .
 except that there isn’t any clear path to getting rid of the virus ,  is there ?
 it will take the world many years more to (mostly) fully vaccinate ,  and even then vaccination doesn’t mean virus eradication (as we see in uk us israel etc) .
 so should countries lockdown borders for another 5 years ?
 why didnt they direct to morgue and -1 count ?
 they open to tourism .
 end up is locals spreading covid around .
 what vaccine they used ?
 must be too many piak piak right  
 so … i see your plan is to close all borders forever then .
 cos even “almost closed” australia which accepts oni 3 , 000 arrivals a week is struggling with lockdowns now .
 but im surprised singapore has chosen to follow that philosophy ,  even worse that many of our leaders have gone through ns .
 and what does ns philosophy say ?
 do 1 time good one ,  then can go back bunk .
 just tough it out for a while oni .
 but no ,  have to make compromises here and there ,  airport cannot close ,  citizens can come back ,  end up we went in and out of cb achieving nothing ,  ha here and there and achieved nothing ,  daily cases still around 150 average ,  begging people to vaccinate even though 70% of the key demographics vaccinated oredi ,  while countries with 30% or less vaccinations have been open for months cos they bit the bullet and suffered for a while ,  now no need to care about vaccinated ,  no need to care about masks and distancing ,  back to normal except for airtight border controls .
 if we close ,  and enough countries close ,  then all the closed countries can open to each other once everything settled .
 then we will live in 2 worlds ,  1 covid-free world ,  and 1 endemic world .
 australia burst precisely cos they imported the virus on a flight ,  thats their downfall .
 yalor ,  why flip prata so fast ?
 anyway i oredi predict that this will happen
 can suucck thumb only
 chiu might as well use debit card .
 debit card is dangerous .
 i dunno about whether he has 250 people .
 but we have 250 people here sleeping well tonight
 tell your fren: .
 get the hotel to dabao the food for the 150 guest .
 get the brothers and sisters who your fren will cut out cos of the 100 limit to then deliver the food to the other 150 guest .
 oso get them to collect the angpow &apos;s for your fren .
 actual intention is to collect angpow to cover ?
 ts wanted to save face and mentioned his friend instead .
 pay with credit card ,  just chargeback
 if your limit is 1 k and chiu have cash 10 k ,  and chiu pay 10k into your cc account ,  your credit limit becomes 11k .
 quite surprised lots of people dunno this .
 this is 1 of the reason why some people can have 45k spending on the cc even when the limit is oni 10k .
 spend 10k pay 10k before the due date ,  u immediately have 10k limit again .
  ngei ngei want to invite max .
 want to get more angpow la .
 of the 250 pax ,  how many actually want to go ?
 wa siao he say now sibei sian need to call alot of people to tell them they not invited .
 just name and shame on social media .
 will get them to respond
 wa i ask another fren he say he oso not going sia cos uninvited  .
 fwhaaa jialat leh .
 but taking a huge risk when planning liddat wor
 very kumgong of your friend .
 this type can oni blame himself
 ts got alot of imaginary friends
 couple got quarrel over this problem .
 maybe the wedding won’t go on as planned .
 ts your friend is his problem .
 why chiu worry for him ?
 this type of job not easy .
 but at least dont film ownself without mask .
 ouh what a way to get lots of views for your videos .
 preparing one with mask look like at or vk ,  whereas the one packing without mask look like jhk
 no la ,  not my video la .
 the one without mask is definitely not a jhk .
 all his other post seems to be in burmese .
 well well ,  what &apos;s done oredi done .
 what kind of job is easy with the mask on ?
 nowaday quite a handful of burmese ,  viet ,  at ,  hong kong ,  pinoy and jhk working here
 this kind of noodle factory usually is sole proprietary or family business .
 the hr will be multi-tasked .
 where got time for all these things ?
 on sundays and ph ,  dont even think of going into their meeting ground .
 cant even squeeze through ,  that was the time when  &apos;social distancing - who cares &apos; attitude comes in .
 how chiu know if this is a local factory or not ?
 seat inside office behind computer .
 that one not doing any physical labour .
 not really leh .
 i part time driving grab wear mask whole day while driving oso very difficult ,  and i am not doing any physical labour as well .
 1 man &apos;s irresponsible action may lead to the suffering of many many others .
 anyway sometimes need to close one eye .
 unless people are sovereign and whole day no wear mask ,  then that one must pawn gao gao lol
 some things we can close one eye ,  some cannot .
 for this ,  if one eye is closed ,  the situation may get out of hand .
 closing one eye is still depending on case by case basis .
 they oni say received my feedback leh .
 so many days liao still no reply from them .
 perhaps 1 x feedback = stir sh*t .
 need more feedback for them to act on it .
 from his posts ,  this is not the first time and certainly not the last .
 now that the covid virus is so prevalent ,  it &apos;s time we protect our loved ones ,  ourselves and our precious hawkers .
 some of them are really old folks who really cant afford be infected .
 we are know how deadly this virus can be ,  to those with underlying illnesses .
 who ask her to have child/son in the first place ?
 kumgong let garbarment sexploit .
 whom did she vote for in the last ge ?

 milestone parade is not last day as nsf .

 imagine those poor kids no public transport to go home liao .
 dinner indented and armskote not cleared isit ?
 don’t understand his message .
 his son’s last active day book out time is at 10pm ,  so they went there to pick him up .
 but complaining when he is late ?

 my last active day ,  my official tell me go sign extra till next day .
 cb sibei entitled .
 it &apos;s their privilege worz .
 who they voted for ?
 imagine next time ,  encik come in and say  &apos;eh recruit tan ,  chiu can book out first .
 your mum waiting for chiu at the gate .
 this is not tekong ?
 is this the kind of basic course for low ses uneducated ones ?
 lol as if other country will respect what time a soldier knocks off .
 clearly she see saf nothing mroe than a boarding school .
 how come infantry unit so jiaklat one ?
 sekali plot twist ,  mama audrey is a tigeress manager who expects her staff to ot till 2359 ,  6 days a week !
 first world problems .
 complain over small things .
 chiu would rather wait a while longer for him to ord than to receive news that he died in some kind of freak accident during service .
 lol ,  when pigs can fly ,  lol .
 why keep importing covid .
 liddat called secure ?
 army so xiong ,  must coddle by mummy .
 uninstalled old one .
 reinstall from google play .
 then i select a message ,   .
 but oni got  &apos;delete for me &apos; option .
 it &apos;s cos whatsapp is not working properly on your phone .
 please buy a new phone and use the new phone .
 after that ,  donate your old phone to me .
 thanks in advance .
 what phone are chiu using ?
 are chiu on android ?
 sometimes developer never update properly for some particular model .
 u using fake whatsapp ?
 from my understanding ,  your recipient whatsapp app needs to support this feature for u to do it
 most likely is the phone .
 there is a time limit to delete messages for everyone .
 how long ago did chiu send it
 yes thats what i read from a website
 who did ts vote for ?
 your answer is there
 this message has been deleted
 it &apos;s a 2020 model what
 ts dunno how to google or never even try to google for the answer isit .
 or neber read what the search results show .
 dunno what to say about ts question  .
 politically-correct is say  &apos;there is no dumb question &apos; but sometimes is like someone got their own watch but ask other people what time isit liddat .
 there is nothing wrong with your phone la .
 it exceeded the time limit liao .
 regret telling the girl chiu love her right ?
 and that is sho shitty .
 basically repeating the mistakes of our forefathers .
 ayia u see how many guys do treadmill on gym u know liao .
 1h is not useful better do some weight training
 sometimes is the time .
 not yet arrived .
 there &apos;s no such thing as converting fats into muscle ,  chiu need a calorie surplus to build muscle ,  to burn fat chiu need a calorie deficit .
 chiu cant both burn fat and build muscle at the same time .
 i dunno what &apos;s your body type now ,  but you &apos;re on the skinny side ,  just consume more calories with high protein in your diet ,  and lift low-rep sets with 70% max .
 cardio is useless for body-building if you &apos;re skinny .
 if you &apos;re fat ,  chiu can do both cardio and weight lifting .
 increasing your muscle mass improves your metabolism and helps chiu lose weight easier .
 some people watch too much tv ,  got preconceived idea of how love should be .
 they never got out of that loop of finding something that isnt there .
 in the end become fa .
 its a choice ,  u want to be a bbfa for your whole life or u want to merry a import chio bu bergin wifey and make a happy family with many babies .
 dont wait for the gods upstairs to drop u a wifey or grab-delivery one to your door-steps ,  nothing is free in this world .
 the amount of money used to tackle a wifey (with no guarantee she finally will merry u)  is definitely more than all the investment used to merry a import wifey .
 perhaps begin the journey within ,  where u find endless change within ,  then u &apos;ll be dispassioned
 whats wrong with bbfa  ?
 nothing sad about being forever alone .
 its how chiu use being alone to your benefit .
 we r happy to have one more bbfa member .
 welcum to bergin crub .
 there is no benefit to being forever alone .
 social media is oso another illusion by the way .
 can spend all your money to simp on onlyfans
 i find your post very insightful .
 for the dating part ,  is it ok to play mind game meh ?
 the guy know what he wants and the girl dont want can just find another girl liao ?
 oso what are the critical questions to ask her first before going official ?
 at how many dates before ask her go official ?
 means kiao ka until 9 aug

 ts create thread to troll but instead kena suan kum gong  .
 dont believe ts .
 sometimes all this young couples so adamant about holding a banquet .
 its covid period .
 why still wanna go the trouble to hold a banquet ?
 just have a small reception with close family and relatives will do .
 why need all this attention for what ?
 chiu invite people to go your wedding ,  they oso force to give angpows .
 now economy oso not good too good and these attendees oso must have to fork out money .
 just rom for legality and do away with banquets .
 if die die still want the attention ,  hold it next time after this pandemic has been eased away .
 must be the bride want attention ,  wanna make up pretty pretty etc etc let people see .
 nobody cares one la .
 marriage life oso between husband and wife oni .
 some couples do this to  &apos;feel important &apos; .
 chiu can put so much time and effort to plan your wedding day etc ,  we as attendees ,  oni go eat the food ,  look see look see ,  congratulate chiu ,  smile smile and we leave the place and go about our lives again .
 we dont even care after that .
 why the hassle especially during covid times ?
 use brain a bit .
 so how much is he going to lugi ?
 wa people suffering oredi still kena suan .
 tiagong they follow the gahment regulations exactly lei .
 but later mp asks him who he voted for
 like crypto market now .
 here &apos;s the thing .
 when restaurants cancel booking or take less customers ,  when airplanes dont fly ,  yet their staff and landlords are still getting the same pay ,  where is their pay coming from despite doing less work ?
 thats right ,  from the victims .
 all the lucky people still dunno the free riding effect they are having on the society .
 believing it’s endemic is one thing ,  it’s another to have the policies and capacity to deal with it  ,  especially with the low vaccination rate at the moment  .
 people who caught the delta covid are literally dying in their homes
 sounds so familiar .
 i hear an echo so near sia .
 this is a warning to our so-called endsimi strategy  .
 ends it before it &apos;s too late  .
 so many examples happening ard they still wanna push for it…… vaccinated or non vac oso e same
 some people for some inexplicable reason just believe that as long as their desire to open up is strong enough ,  they don’t have to face the reality that they haven’t recover from a pandemic .
 maybe some of the tourists come come countries that sell fake vaccinations certificates .
 maybe some of the vaccinated tourists are actually infected but show zero symptoms on arrival to phuket .
 its definitely not unexpected
 cannot blame them la .
 thailand too dependent on tourism .
 go youtube watch pattaya video ,  entire town dead liao
 many sinkies really think they are special .
 if not for reserves built up over the years and the gahment can give some help ,  even more would be retrenched .
 when chiu are retrenched like those in thailand ,  chiu will be desperate to open up too .
 just cos never affected your own rice bowl ,  chiu say people stupid ,  really bunch of retards .
 everyday oni know of getting the gahment to give them protection via lockdown etc etc .
 such protection cost money and cannot do long term .
 people who are poor and no money to eat have their own reason to open up .
 just cos chiu are not hungry enough cos really no money to eat does not makes chiu any special .
 put chiu in their shoes ,  no job ,  no money etc ,  chiu will oso be desperate for economy to open up .
 rather have 2% chance to die from covid then 100% chance to die of starvation
 prayut keen to showcase .
 fell and bloody smack flat on the pavement face down squarely now .
 hopefully countries watch and not learn .
 90 is their gahmen threshold ,  just move the bar to 200 and life goes as as usual 
 no herd immunity
 considering singapore does not have huge pool of resources to spend on disease control and management like cheena ,  suffer-once concept will not work .
 given that all it takes is for one mistake to slip through ,  who can guarantee new variants wont seep through the future border control once we open up for all ?
 mass vaccination is the key to protect our population by statistics ,  99 .
 9% of people lives ,  0 .
 1% die ,  is kind of acceptable from the politically correctness view point .
 this is not a dictatorship cruelly nor ethnic cleansing ,  it applies to the general rule of the fittest survival ,  the weaker ones always lose out ,  in almost all aspects of life .
 without covid ,  same amount of people would have perished for some other reasons anyway ,  for example road accidents .
 many are worried about the adverse effects of the vaccination in longer term ,  it is a valid concern .
 it took almost 5 years for ebola vaccine to get approved officially by the fda and is not guaranteed 100% safe .
 i think we just need to be a little bit more realistic that even we cut the time by half ,  it will still be 2 years away until covid vaccine can be fda approved for x% of safety applied .
 if we dont open up earlier ,  everything we hold dear now ,  our job security ,  handsome income ,  foreign investments ,  lower cost labour ,  life conveniences ,  will disappear one by one .
 we will become a nation that is full of highly competitive people ,  without an economy structure to support their needs and wants .
 life will be 5-10 times harder than now ,  tax will be 2-3 time higher ,  happiness index will definitely drop .
 i dont think this is what people wanted to see .
 before the long term vaccine effect hits ,  let say affecting 20% of the population ,  the 80% of the population might run out of options to have a good life in singapore .
 everyone will want to downgrade the hdb to get some cash in the pocket ,  we got so many 1-3 rooms hdb to downgrade for people ?
 can chiu compromise on your kids study and tuition fees ?
 sinkie needs to travel overseas twice a year to feel good ,  can still afford ?
 mnc and local big corporations will hire older people over younger fresh grads for 5 times cheaper cost when the labours flood the market ?
 even chiu are willing to take over our dear bangla brother &apos;s road work ,  the construction company oso cant afford to hire chiu at the salary chiu needed .
 whole day worry about ktv f&b licenses ,  chiu guys must be kidding .
 one small island oso cannot declare endemic .
 we one country going to be endemic soon !
 aug is really our independence day
 haven start oredi know the end result liao
 who can guarantee ?
 of course cannot ,  but thats not the goal .
 the goal is to do everything in our power to prevent it .
 vaccine is for the individual ,  contact tracing is for the community ,  border controls is for the country .
 chiu can go on and on about vaccines ,  but it &apos;s not choosing one or the other ,  all are needed ,  multiple levels of protection ,  cannot skimp on one and rely on another .
 and this is all ignoring the part where there are countries with local economies fully running ,  no masks ,  no restrictions ,  oni with no immigrants .
 we have more than enough construction workers in dorms ,  still need how many ?
 when the whole country is clean ,  no need to worry about their health ,  instead of right now where dorm cases pop up here and there ,  whole place needs to be shut down .
 and they &apos;re all vaccinated oredi ,  where do chiu go from there ?
 what &apos;s your plan b when chiu finally realise vaccines are not enough ?
 plan b is if vaccination fail ,  will find some excuses to say that we need to continue working on more effective vaccines .
 from here onwards ,  vaccination is oso plan c ,  plan d ,  all the way to plan z .
 one bottle of oyster sauce can be used to cook many different dishes .
 seriously la ,  the problem is not about blocking out and not letting virus in ,  the problem is that as long as a country has to depend on others for survival ,  we cannot close the border .
 at the deeper level ,  this is not how the viruses work oso .
 chiu think when the patients recovered from covid ,  the virus is eradicated 100% meh ?
 there are some left overs in them being managed by their own immunity system .
 if time is right ,  the body is weak ,  the virus outbreak can happen again on the same person .
 no matter how rare it is ,  remember ,  it just take 1 such incident to populate the virus back to the whole nation .
 under such circumstances ,  how many times and how much money chiu want to spend repeating over and over again on tracking and curbing ?
 not everyone like us and cheena when money not enough just run to the printing machines oi .
 i oso dunno which country in the world oni have local residences without foreign workers or tourists of some sorts .
 even then they may have foreign monkeys trespassing once in s a while ,  without pcr test and passport some more .
 it &apos;s not a hypothetical ,  it &apos;s reality in a few countries ,  they have opened fully oredi ,  no masks ,  no restrictions of any kind locally .
 and why do we need to depend on others for survival ?
 thats all pretend oni .
 the useless sia can keep giving billions to do nothing ,  we have more than enough to tank the problems for the next few years if we stop spending on stupid things like sia and businesses (who dont pass on any of the money to their workers anyway) and paying fines to the indian gahment cos of nonsense investments .
 if we keep our country clean ,  we can open to other clean country .
 i &apos;ve said this before ,  the  &apos;new normal &apos; will be one world split into two ,  the covid-free world ,  and the endemic world ,  and i dunno why chiu want to choose the second option .
 no ,  vaccines is not the answer ,  such a solution doesnt exist .
 how long have they been chasing the flu virus ,  dozens of variations that every flu season need to guess which vaccine is suitable for that place and that time period ,  and still not 100% .
 the covid vaccine strategy is praying that the virus doesnt mutate faster than the vaccines can catch up ,  but now with the added handicap of vaccine makers being stubborn and pretending their products can protect more than they really can ,  and subsequently not making new vaccines and having to go through the whole certification process again and again .
 ho ching mentioned new potential vaccines that we might be using ,  bharat (covaxin) straight out of the box oni 65% vs delta ,  and it &apos;s oni phase 3 results ,  not released yet .
 havent release and fail oredi ,  just not fast enough .
 it &apos;s this failure of seeing the big picture ,  always wanting to take the easy way out ,  always thinking about the economy in the short term ,  that has us going around in circles liddat .
 mouth say oni ,  open open open ,  but the reality is that everyone knows it &apos;s unacceptable ,  ndp postponed ,  schools closed ,  dining in banned ,  dining 2 ,  dining 5 ,  dining banned again ,  bloomberg and other countries arm chioing at our fickleness .
 oh mai~ clement korkor is a bear type~
  i can offer my services as exercise partner to her .
 exercising with a friend is oso more fun ,  so i hope to keep this up and make it a habit .
 i can exercise on the bed with her and provide protein shake for recovery after that .

 woah lao i think i tio covid-10 then
 what is there to hiam .
 unless chiu got inferior complex .
 she is naturalised singkee liao .

 apparently the guy is otaku gamer n is very smart in school .
 all classmates say he is very friendly and soft spoken .
 ended up raped his gf when she wanna breaks up with him .
 then one day he woke up saw his watch is 04 .
 44am he decided today is the day to kill his gf .
 so he waited for her to class by  ,  ask her to patch back .
 when she refused he slashed her forty plus times n after she was motionless on the road  ,  he took off the panties n lick the private part n took off his pants n tried to have sex with the corpse in front of public .
 no one dares to go up and stop him .
 sometimes smart people a bit siao
 fast act than our multi-minsters
 oh nose oh nose
 heng that time didnt manage to apply for the tickets
 wlwlsmdwl ,  i wanna to istana ssll .
 karma of having president selected by race ?
 maybe this year got chance cannot celerate again .

 every youtube videos i watch the comment section got him .
 i remember many years ago i watch his youtube video on piano .
 why he crazy liao ?
 i read if never do a thorough sanitised wash might kena chao goat cheese and worse tio fungus growth !
 thats why moi kiasii aways standby dettol liao .
 bro ,  dettol not 100% effective .
 i suggest chiu boil a pot of water and dip in it .
 not many viruses can withstand 100 degrees celsius .
 use insect repellent 
 need to use mac on kukujiao thats why got mckukujiao
 yes will wash thoroughly for hygiene  .
 use saliva clean la cos tiagong saliva can kill germs too .
 thats why after pew liao ,  must ask the girl to cum your lil bro to clean it .
 if chiu pcc ,  then chiu ownself cum your own lil bro to clean it .
 yup ,  my fb/fwb always suck/lick it clean after every piak piak session with them .
 shiok shiok feeling at the head .
 wa some so high ?
 if one person is oredi infected .
 i thought as in general .
 just take a look at tfr bottom list  nearly all east asians .
 most of them are reminded of the hardships growing up in a family with many children
 i think ,  its cultural issue .
 different races in singapore have very different birth rates and going in different directions .
 so whats wrong with east asian culture that create such low birth rates ?
 before that they had the highest birth rate rofl
 my guess is that young women these days don’t care much about having kids and having a family .
 they are more focused on their careers .
 38pm is unearthly hour ?

 2 hrs is insignificant .
 bunch of gu niangs .
 soldier la still need parents to pick up and complain ?
 either parents kaypo insist to pick the guy or the guy is spineless .
 either way is hopeless .
 tell her to see her mp 
 technically still within that 2 years ma
 double yellow lines .
 lta do yoir jogs
 u think dad your father company ah ?
 chiu havent come across ict release from camp at 2359 sharp on a sunday night in a god forsaken part of singapore one .
 then mon morning all have to go back to work
 saw on tv ,  experts claim expect traveling on year end .
 media interview one local girl who claim going to plan go japan and thailand this year end .
 saw her house seem like stay at orchard rd one of the condo there .
 she seem like just 20+ or in early 30s .
 this one has rich high ses parent as support .
 path oredi created for her
 go dome l start listing can alr
 women have multiple paths .
 she can be capable and like chiu work her way to success .
 or she can just marry a successful spouse and take 1/2 with wc .
 today &apos;s younger women can even explore  &apos;new &apos; paths that are not open to males like sugarbaby and onlyfans .
 i guess in life ,  regardless whether male or female ,  some will earn more some will earn less .
 comfortable good enough liao ,  dunnid to compare .
 nowadays women earning power r higher & faster .
 u cant compare gen y/z nowadays .
 they got parents with high earning power
 corporate job many ceca and angmo .
 u wan them hire local man or young girls
 during my internship in cbd ,  at the dua kee meeting between the head of each departments ,  moi notice more than half is zhabor .
 seems like all hold quite high position
 now wonder locals guy feel less confident since local girls earn more than guys .
 chiu comparing to women ofcourse la .
 women got so many options last time is gaylang now just do onlyfans or sugar daddy can easily earn more then an average salary comfortably .
 not to mention they actually have +2years advantage … .
 many dress sexy can earn more than moi lor .
 standard on ig post photo showing some  cleavage who knows got sponsor come ask how much to promote  .
 on facebook sell thing oso show some  cleavage attract people to see  .
 do streaming play game oso show some  cleavage .
 want to impress boss every day show some  cleavage make boss happy thus get promote faster .
 zhabor earn higher no surprise .
 the prettier and sexier earn most .
 the 2 year headstart can easily overcome the ns privilege pay .
 yes ,  very common .
 wife earn more than husband too .
 husband just cruise through life song song
 female privilege in singapore .
 taboo topic ,  nobody spoke about in public
 self fulfilling prophercy
 chiu have to play mind games .
 but do not gaslight her to a point she questions her sanity .
 do it lightly with a noble purpose of being with her .
 i have had countless women in my life .
 as a father of 2 teenage girls now ,  i am ashamed of my past .
 but i am what i am .
 i try to justify my actions this way: before marrying ,  it is an open game .
 i am exploring the best options for myself .
 do not do this after chiu are married .
 the repercussions are severe .
 no questions please .
 just get physical and go with the flow; bed her .
 sometimes after bedding her ,  the position is still not clear .
 often business contracts fail to materialize cos both parties are too busying negotiating - and disagreeing - with the details .
 this is the same for relationships .
 why must one make things  &apos;official &apos; or ask questions ,  and in the process ruin everything ?
 there is no hard and fast rule .
 i have asked a lady to  &apos;go official &apos; in one date .
 i never like this term official and can tell chiu most ladies do not like it too .
 who likes commitments on something to be enjoyed ?
 the fastest i got a woman is 1 night ,  or ons as they call it .
 typically ,  it takes me 2-3 weeks to land a lady .
 i do not have a number on the times we dated .
 on the other extreme ,  i have  &apos;gone official &apos; with another lady oni after 2 years .
 she was my bff and a married woman with child .
 the intent was never to bed her but alas .
 it is very hard to resist an attractive married woman .
 chiu stumble yourself by coining the term  &apos;official &apos; .
 read my previous post .
 do not give the lady the assurances she wants (to keep her wanting more from you) .
 here is another sad truth .
 i never uttered those infamous 3 words  &apos;i love you &apos;  to my gf / wife before marrying her .
 last part really meh ?
 girls can be fickle minded ,  one moment can agreed with going out with chiu ,  the next ghosted u
 23 will vert fast become 26 ,  then 30 then 35 .
 by then too late liao
 confidence is a fine balancing act .
 i’ve seen guys trying to portray confidence and ended up looking like a complete asshole .
 what u gonna do  ?
 plenty of other women chiu can meet and flirt with
 there is group chat for such thing ?
 later your wife see u in the group how ?
 move on liao la
 how the girl will know u want to go out with her ?
 never say never ,  op .
 just do not adopt the same mindset as andy bbfas .
 b cups cannot ,  got tats cannot .
 1% cannot ,  30+ yo cannot ,   hair not long enough cannot ,  got bf before cannot ,  a bit of comestic surgery cannot ,  etc .
 like almost everything oso cannot .
 good luck and stay safe .
 i think one the reason is our singapore pool is too low to search a mate ,  need to explore overseas liao .
 quite impressive that chiu can be happy even with painful imprint in chiur life .
 moi oso kena stuffs in life that made moi numb liao .
 sho moi cant be humourous or funny .
 just living life monotonously .
 girls usually know what they dont like but struggle with things/people they like or going to like .
 but this usually goes away when chiu encounter older women with more experience ,  they can tell chiu what they like and dislike .
 when lao kok kok if chiu rich oso can get 18 year olds to sark chiur deek .
 brother ,  how old  ?
 thank chiu for finding some parts useful .
 if your question pertains to morals ,  not approach ,  my answer as such .
 it is a noble but yet un-executable notion to find a life partner without first exploring options ,  and at the same time ,  try to be  &apos;honest ,  sincere ,  loyal and plan future &apos; with every lady chiu are with .
 read it above again .
 one part has to yield .
 yes ,  chiu can label it cheating .
 the takeaway is i was not married yet and every one is entitled to explore; in order to find the one .
 i dont go in with the intention of wasting her time .
 i go in ,  with the intention of finding out if she is the one .
 i admit ,  some times it is just lust .
 i am not perfect .
 i do not do it consciously to a lady who has good intentions .
 i have a conscience .
 at the same time ,  some ladies just want to have fun .
 so nobody is disadvantaged .
 love and dreams
 my wife knows i am in that group and very active .
 there are lots to be learnt from group sharings .
 their failures ,  their success .
 i dont see anything wrong with it ,  and most importantly ,  neither does my wife .
 chiu got to open your mouth to ask .
 do not take rejections personally .
 see it this way: at least chiu asked .
 if the answer is no ,  chiu can tell yourself at least chiu have tried and it was not to be .
 seldom will chiu find girls that will ask chiu out instead ,  am i right ?
 think of it this way .
 i have had ladies ask me out before .
 it is very uncomfortable to be someone chiu dont like .
 so i prefer to do the asking ,  so that i can choose who i like .
 most times ,  it boils down to gut feel .
 when she clicks with chiu ,  when the conversations are smooth ,  chiu will know it .
 do not make it an  &apos;official &apos; date .
 it frightens her .
 something like ,  hey ,  chiu know that famous char kway teow stall chiu were talking about ,  i am suddenly craving it .
 lets go eat that tomoro ai mai ?
 always do something that interests her ,  not interest chiu oni .
 like lets play mobile legends .
 chiu know she is not going to be interested .
 so got time limit ah walan
 the interval u sent and del cannot be too long 
 sent picture la .
 like regret sending .
 better dont send pics in the 1st place ?
 post it here for us to advise chiu better .
 what kind of pic ?
 dont tell me mackukujiao type hor
 if not wrong ,  2+ hours time limit .
 everyone has seen your nude pic
 that’s cos chiu can oni delete for everyone within a certain time window .
 try to message and immediately delete for everyone should work
 there is a time limit one .
 after that time limit , cannot delete for everyone anymore .
 maybe chiu are trying to delete a message past that time limit .
 try it on new messages chiu just posted .
 cos chiu yongsui
 heng moi use telegram
 why？ u send your d picture to some one is it ?
 in before user problem .
 there &apos;s your answer
 but google says if the receiver is using iphone .
 the pic will still be in his gallery ?
 even after i press delete for everyone
 yes within 1 hr only
 ya telegram i use ok better .
 but picture receiver oso can download save
 likely phone issue or your whasapp &apos;s other parties have to oredi read your msg so the option auto disappear lor .
 this one i dunno .
 but i think for android .
 can set whatsapp photos to appear in the phone gallery .
 not sure if that will save the photo in the gallery though .
 never experiment before
 time to buy iphone 13 pro max  .
 in response to essential and front-line workers not having enough places to consume their takeaway food at ,  many malls are opening up their foodcourts and public places for this purpose (designated eating areas at malls ,  extended grace period at carparks ,  may 23) .
 oni one diner is allowed per table ,  which must be placed at least 1m from the next one .
 by the same token ,  why not allow food outlets to resume dine-in service on the same basis ,  in addition to serving takeaways ?
 outlets that are able to rearrange their seating into single-diner tables at least 1m apart should be allowed to resume limited dine-in service in order to supplement their takings from selling takeaway food .
 this way ,  the impact of the recent covid measures on food outlets can be somewhat cushioned ,  while less takeaway waste is produced .
 cheng shoong tat
 i started a thread on this idea oredi .
 and so did many here suggested this move as well .
 this cheng shoong that shud just stuff egg tarts into his mouth/brain
 1 diner per table .
 perfect for bbfa
 not a bad idea .
 one diner per table will just diam diam and eat ,  not talk until virus fly everywhere .
 this is good idea
 i have seen people coughing without covering their mouth while eating
 should be liddat like having o level exams with some spacing .
 then need to set timer on the seat .
 if overtime got alarm sound until the diner leave his seat .
 give it like 1-2 more months la ,  should go back to allow dining up to 5 persons liao .
 1 diner for essential workers make sense .
 one diner one table eat and shout across next table ?
 yes ,  finally can eat hotpot alone without people staring
 actually ,  i oso think this is a good idea .
 better for me too since i always ate alone .
 bbfa dream is everywhere can solo dining
 lol friend = ts .
 might as well bring prostitute .
 see chiu no up no balls to part the red sea .
 pay for cruise .
 moi is pay for gf cai png niaa .
 somemore curry zup foc
 she testing if chiu are the reliable one but u backstab here .
 she has made use of chiu .
 change another gf
 my bro just went cruise with gf .
 said super boring due to full of cecas and fts hogging everything .
 even pool turned dirty with them in it .
 why chiu so beh kan ?
 others just need a staircase .
 kick her into the sea
 after come back cruise can write a similar to legendary shanghai uncle story
 on the last night ,  still no piak piak ,  dont care .
 force yourself on her .
 means is floating robert loh
 then chiu look for cruise waitress   ,  the singer ,  the cleaner etc
 nope but in such romantic setting ,  on international water ,  should have the feel to piak piak .
 it should come as a package chiu know
 someone needs to initiate i guess .
 did your friend initiate in the first place ?
 if not ,  i think the so called r/ship should be reaching the final episode soon .
 wa cruise no piak piak ,  but sleep on bed together ?
 or cruise ,  sleep separate rooms ?
 sry cruise i go 2 are all 1 big bed .
 is it a must to piak piak ?
 cannot sit down and talk meh .
 talk abt life ,  abt future .
 sounds like very sore and very loserish .
 complain to the gf &apos;s mom ?
 why chiu guys go cruise must think so dirty ?
 i really like your response and the positive attitude .
 running a country is very much like running a sustainability program .
 it &apos;s not about just doing the right thing ,  it is about having a system that can replace the depleted resources fast enough so that the system itself can self generate to maintain the current balance .
 one must always ask ,  what balance is this system trying to maintain .
 haha why never treat it as endemic ?
 own bank balance lah
 edmw bbfa logic .
 1) money can be printed and given freely and unlimited in singapore .
 2) singapore can afford to close itself to the world for the next few years and reopen to see a world full of rainbows  welcoming them with open arms and singapore will just pick itself up and lead the world in anything  .
 3) if it’s not affecting me ,  it’s not my problem and it will never happen to me
 the cases are mainly locals despite 70% fully vaccinated  .
 higher vaccination rate than singapore
 u mean okt pap .
 we are the unwilling prostitutes .
 once they open borders ,  the infection numbers will sky rocket .
 the number of deaths will be a critical indicator on the international level .
 if vaccinations are not able to effectively  reduce the number of deaths in the event of new variants ,  no one would want to come into singapore .
 then there is the aspect of long-term after effects of covid infection on those who recovered which oni they will bare .
 these are still relatively unknown and is currently downplayed .
 we oredi have free flow of goods and services .
 why are we so obsessed with the free flow of people .
  we are not as dependent on tourism as thailand and we have the resources to pivot away from this .
 not like tourism or mice events are going to come roaring back .
 so the obsession is to import more ft and let their bf/gf and whole kampong come in while we citizens suffer the consequences of lockdown and deaths ?
 yalor ,  they must learn from our elite gahment .
 i believe there is relation in restrictions in travelling  and mental health of people .
 it seems like there &apos;s a spike in depression and suicide intentions the past year .
 i know stories of people who committed suicide as they are unable to travel os - to do business or visit someone .
 with this most recent closure it is going to be much worse for locals in phuket and other tourist destinations
 well it &apos;s fun while it lasted .
 where got house 220k so cheap ?

 go to geylang serai .
 got many seafood stalls there
 freshness is v important especially for those who eat prawn noodles .
 i have no car n time to travel there not worth it as i am staying at east side .
 last year i used to stock up fresh seafood 1 month in advance as pricing would be lower than cny  .
 this year bo time to go market till today .
 bro chiu got big house and big freezer  .
 sometimes no time to go market i usually would buy wild caught fresh fish and prawns to store for a month
 so early open le ?

 the market open so early got people meh ?
 as no food there to eat .

 still need to pick up their son ?
 ownself go home cannot ?
 the usual self entitlement mindset .
 and i suppose chiu are the satki arbiter who decides ?
 chiu all should know the different scenarios when they cannot release people even when there is parents waiting outsai huan .
 regulars is oso huan to go home early huan .
 first time seeing this milestone parade .
 how to go back home after midnight when the public transport has ceased .
 route march home or stay in ,  choose one .
 commanders say  &apos;find your own transport &apos; ,  before driving home in their continental cars .
 for young regular ,  it &apos;s japanese car .
 who chiu voted for ?
 cannot go home on his own ?
 need mummy to pick ?
 i leemember on my ord day ,  the guailan regular staff sgt refuse to let me collect my pink ic unless i cut my hair .

 i curse him dio cancer early child born no piyan .
 it &apos;s been so many years ,  but i still hope the worst for him .
 she ownself answer ownself liao la .

 tonite can sleep well
 hope his son &apos;s ranjiao grows on the nose .
 good luck to her son &apos;s future spouse .
 war time will have knock off timing and oso will never have unexpected circumstances one .
 i can imagine next time this kind of son married liao still need parents teach how to fahk the girl .
 buy a car today ,  sell tomorrow chow chow lose 30% value .

 if wanna compare ,  compare those people who have nothing
 ts want to do at balcony ?
 dump the body off the cruise no ?
 means u have fail as a man ,  jump water from the cruise
 cheaper to just go geylang and pay $150 .
 she was in a different cabin from chiu ?
 golden rule is to tps first before chiu invest in her .
 if chiu cannot tps her ,  then dont waste money on her .
 no piak piak at least must get a bj ask her to swallow .
 1 cuise for 2 is about $1 .
 9k for a decent balcony room .
 assume piak atb fl at $100/1/1 rate ,  can piak 19 times with 19 different women .
 is my friend not me .
 anyway is same cabin
 small size wild caught prawns between $16-18 per kg
 things r exp in kovan wet market .
 but one vege stall is so much cheaper around fruit stall ,  one old uncle is selling)  than the usually stall which has many customers flooding to buy from the stall (fat uncle wearing huge gold chain) .
 boon keng market i went before .
 30am++++ not even stalls opened or ready !
 amk 631 wet market opens very early one .
 usually 8+am not much fish left liao
 thank for the inform .
 will relate to my mum .
 but doubt she will go
 i saw giant $15 the prawns very big .
 same for cold storage
 now few or no fishermen outside catching .
 so where or when chiu think the seafood has been coming .
 most fishmongers would have sold out by saturday morning .
 chiu guys better buy before then .
 else go battle and fight it out at super markets .
 ah soo market have better choices .
 kovan quite cut throat
 buy from elsewhere
 is it compulsory ?
 i personally dont have any except for a hospitalization plan for emergencies paid via medisave .
 are those monthly insurance plan ,  e .
 endowment or whatever paid monthly  really needed   ?
  or just a con job by the insurers  
 u can go read up  .
 but most importantly insurance is not investment .
 bottomline: medical/health ,  home fire - yes .
 endowment ,  investment linked ,  others - oni if chiu got spare cash to throw
 can always go yolo mentality
 why u ask here ?
 must get hospitalisation ,  term and critical illness .
 rest is optional .
 early critical illness and cancer coverage is depends on your family history oso .
 endowment is good if chiu want to not hands on investing .
 returns is dependent on market conditions but is usually 4% for mid to long term .
 yes worth it oni idiot dont buy
 got family yes very impt .
 if bbfa just buy enough to support parents in old age .
 depends on how much chiu tolerate uncertainty .
 insurance is pretty much exchanging the uncertainty of a large loss for the certainty of a small loss .
 insurance damn important .
 need satki insurance scums to help chiu sign on the dotted line .
 if something happens and chiu need it ,  - yay .
 if nothing happens then chiu dunnid it - nay .
 it all depends on individual and affordability .
 thats his revenue .
 so what &apos;s his net profit ?
 this guy huat big siol
 even burberry has to diao zui stocks from other outlet to support this livestream
 he in switzerland now .
 hope he sell rolex lelong lelong .
 sorry ,  is wang lei by any chance wlh relative ah ?
 will go tw and use  
 can sic the group ?
 for me ,  my dad was a violent man with a nasty temper .
 my mom is a gambling addict .
 every night they fought .
 sometimes with knives .
 invariably ,  in their quarrels ,  they cited their failing marriage on having kids .
 i interpreted that to mean - me .
 that i am the cause of their angst .
 it made me suicidal .
 i attempted suicide several times .
 i would cut my wrist .
 chiu see ,  the oni escape for me then was laughter .
 i had to make light of situations .
 if i were to analyze everything seriously ,  i would have succeeded in my suicide attempts or lose it mentally .
  so i was  &apos;trained &apos; from young to be humorous .
 i suggest chiu find an escape for yourself .
 if chiu keep things bottled up inside ,  chiu will one day go berserk when the volcano inside chiu erupts .
 try to find a meaning to life .
 i found mine in religion .
 cos no one cared about me ,  it was a comforting feeling knowing that someone up there does .
 ts at your age is considered young .
 but before chiu get into a relationship chiu need to understand a few things .
 there is no perfect girl ,  just like us there are no perfect men .
 chiu will have certain criteria that chiu think chiu will like to have in your dream girl but most of the time ,  when chiu get a girlfriend ,  chiu will realise that your girlfriend is nothing like your dream girl .
 many times we dont even know what kind of girls we like ,  except for the general norm - pretty face ,  good figure ,  big breast ,  sweet etc .
 what chiu need to do is to know more people .
 i know it is tough during this period where many outdoor activities are unlikely .
 knowing more people is good cos chiu make new friends and if your personality is good enough ,  these new friends may introduce your future girlfriend to chiu .
 join interest groups that chiu like ,  be it cycling ,  hiking ,  nature ,  dancing ,  art ,  sports whatever .
  joining charity and volunteering groups and events can be an option .
 the point is know more friends and spend your time meaningfully .
 be nice ,  be friendly and be sincere .
 join the interest groups via facebook and telegram now .
 it is on wechat .
 pm me your wechat id .
 i will add chiu .
 by the way ,  it is a group for divorced / sexless marriage / troubled relationships .
 if chiu are in neither categories ,  chiu will not resonate with the contents .
 instead of trying to find love ,  why not do what chiu love to do  .
 from there chiu might find someone with same hobbies like yourself .
 i was 30+ when i had a failed relationship  .
 went traveling (like an emo bbfa) and that was when i met my current wife who was oso single and we didnt expect to find love outside singapore  .
 she is oso sinkie  .
 we met each other during our oversea trips  .
 and found out she and me have some similar hobbies  .
 badminton ,  anime ,  traveling ,  eating jap food etc .
 ts ,  work hard ,  improve yourself ,  buy a ev car ,  go out more ,  things will change .
 thanks for your honest and real sharing .
 sounds like chiu had a rough childhood but life has offered chiu lots of female warmth to make up for it  .
 what chiu shared about getting women makes alot of sense ,  from my observations and personal experiences .
 i find there are alot of single guys here who are bitter and it &apos;s very sad cos ,  there &apos;s actually a way out for them ,  as people like yourself and a few others have generously shared .
 but many prefer to justify why they cannot find a partner ,  rather than taking the effort to actually change themselves to improve their chances of success .
 im 30 this year .
 just ended my first relationship .
 ts ,  chiu still have a long way to go .
 know what chiu really want and save yourself some heartbreaks .
 i honestly dont think it is hard for chiu to find love in this lifetime .
 but i think it is going to be hard for chiu to find the love chiu think chiu deserve .
 in before edmwers come and ask u liao .
 if i may speak on mly &apos;s behalf ,  i dont think he means that he is constantly  &apos;advertising &apos; himself to find the next better buyer .
 but rather ,  it &apos;s important that his wife understands that he has options .
 it doesnt mean he &apos;s looking to bail at the first opportunity .
 but he can if he had too .
 and it probably ,  it should work the other way too .
 who wants to be with someone whom nobody else wants ?
 yeah good advice ,  just go overseas and do what chiu like .
 i will think about settling when i am 35  
 but how do chiu know what is the love that he thinks he deserves ?
 love yourself is the most important .
 i am always planning something for myself .
 eg where to eat .
 i always have something to look forward to .
 right now  ,  i am planning and still deciding if i should go to ce la vi at the month end .
 im going alone  ,  and i know i will still enjoy myself  .
 dunnid to be emo about single
 totally agree with this point .
 for me ,  once i get the vibe of being unwanted ,  i start seeking other options and try to detach myself emotionally .
 not sure if im sick in the head but it beats getting hurt ,  i &apos;d rather be the first to leave .
 some times ,  what appears to be a blessing - the ease i get women - manifests as a curse ,  in the long run .
 chiu see me good ,  i see chiu good .
 chiu nailed the problem in the last para .
 yes ,  many here are sceptical and cynical about women .
 hence they conclude erroneously  that the problem is with singapore women ,  not them .
 this is nothing .
 that gc i alluded to has 300 people putting the blame on their partners .
 she is not providing sex after the childbirth .
 my hubby is seeing another women .
 my wife displays no interest in our marriage .
 he is not providing for the family etc .
 the list goes on and on .
 oni 2 out of 300 were cognizant to recognise that the problem is actually with themselves .
 they screwed up .
 not their partner .
 imagine counseling such a group !
 micheal jackson said it best in his song .
 the problem is always with the man in the mirror .
 if chiu want to make the world - or your relationships - a better place ,  take a look at yourself and make that change .
 chiu cant change the bbfa here .
 but chiu can change yourself and make life sweeter for yourself .
 vivi considered suay  ?
 many times is beh kan .
 chiu see someone fired once from a job .
 ok maybe suay .
 two three times ?

 tiktok gotch alot of such videos la .

 the milk turning chao sng liao must let him drink it
 the 4-year molest case in the news ah ,  .
 it shows that female sales reps for those pharma companies have dangerous occupational risk ,  doesnt it  ?
 they go inside doctor &apos;s room ,  then need to charm and beguile the doctor to buy their products ,  otherwise they dont hit the sales target .
 maybe they need to do certain things ,  use their sex appeal ,  and maybe they become victims to sexual harassment .
 i think it &apos;s a tough job .
 what do chiu think  ?
 i was in a private clinic .
 wa the way the pharma sales rep dress up ,  really is dress to kill one .
 i think she was promoting viagra or cialis or something .
 at least she was way more entertaining to look at than the her world magazines .
 after that i asked the doctor about her .
 and he said see so many naked people oredi .
 no fweeling haha
 its common practice in pharma trade .
 but the money’s good .
 once doctor sign to order chiu drugs ,  the order will keep coming in .
 do 1 time oni but sales is continuous
 never been an officer before .
 so totally no idea
 yes is nt for the weak minded .
 there &apos;s a name for those officers who are not respected .
 they are called occifer
 the people around chiu all educated , sucessful and high ses kids .
 jialat oso they will support and give chiu moral support .
 u around those ahbeng mono intake or useless strawberry poly kids lagi jialat .
 the oni tough day was yesterday
 last time i saw them cadets clear soc in fbo ,  i think many rounds ,  jin shag sia~
 depend farmer or scholar company
 burn alot of weekends and need to write essays .
 not necessarily true .
 moi posted to 1st guard .
 but now dunno where the fugging camp go where oso .
 shouting at people must be good
  ahbeng will support u with money and job .
 and sometimes got ahlians as free gifts .
 now it &apos;s strawberry generation .

 actually ns bengs are quite helpful if chiu fren fren them .
 the calculative ones are jc kias .
 depends whether got white horse
 u see those miw last time serve ocs ,  now they look tough anot ?
 give me $ i oso dont wan go .
 ocs is tough in a way that its very demanding schedule can wear your brain out .
 very little sleep and alot of things to do .
 whole day like ot 18 hours kind .
 physical is ok cos can condition body .
 it’s different from bmt whereby after night snack u can relak etc and have 7 hours of sleep .
 ocs first term is very mentally demanding .
 those that get posted to 2nd term infantry is the most siong lol .
 9 months stressing the brain and body out
 i think like with most vocations ,  it &apos;s not really physically tough if chiu are fit .
 may be my batch was different ,  cos we had a batch mate who was the son of a vvip ,  from bmt to ocs .
 so my friend hired a servant last year ,  to do cleaning etc .
 the servant at the start say until very good ,  will do work wholeheartedly ,  make sure my friend happy with her work .
 few months down ,  she become demanding ,  ask for more pay ,  complain that my friend make the house dirty and not cos she never clean .
 chiu all say what to do with her ?
 bro can share servant ig ?
 it &apos;s called helper .
 simi ig chiu want 
 your fwen considered lucky liao .
 tia gong my friend sibei jialat .
 kena sued by her servant til have to beg all the neighbours for money .
 just change her !
 that servant got bring indian bf to sekretly to fark or not .
 fark liao fark whole familee
 that is the correct term .
 your fren servant lucky ,  some picked from rubbish bin kena see pao chin tian .

 chiu dont see ugly or fat people complain about discrimination .
 its always them blackies
 sometimes it &apos;s not the color but their aloof attitude & their self entitled nature .
 no need to guess which country folks .
 i isn can understand the frustration of these gheys .
 if they are from minority and worse their community is traditional and no accept homosexuals .
 they have difficulty finding parters from the same race .
 the new trend that’s coming up now is referring to asians as urine due to the color of it .
 1st world problem .
 ownself partner is ownself choose de ,  now chiu telling moi cannot choose ?
 cos chiu will be offended it &apos;s cos of chiur race ?
 chiu die die huan force dem be wit chiu ?
 at least the chinese girls dont discriminate
 everything oso racist .
 cannot have preference meh .
 while they themselves oso hiam 3 hiam 4 what  .
  &apos;no chubs ,  no older than 40 yo ,  no sissies .
 oni whites have no negative associations with their skin colour ,  they must be the true master race
 white is considered purity .
 anything else is coloured .
 gay oso racist  ?
 i thought they spread love and anti-discrimination .
 melissa zeh zeh ?
 prostitutes/fls oso can choose clients ,  no say them racists ?
 knn self entitled farkers
 thats what they would have chiu think .
 useless thread without poloboiboi and adam lambert
 these people really is in higher realms .
 self titled 9696
 thats what chiu said and what chiu keep inside your heart
 the channel inside alot amdl .
 chiu have put it correctly lol
 im a ssfa auntie living alone .
 waiting to die and let neighbours smell my rotten corpse 
 yes chiu have rightly said so .
 my traumatic childhood shaped my dating views .
 i cant change my past .
 at one stage ,  i churned women to hurt them .
 cos i was hurt by women and my parents failed marriage .
 fortunately that thinking was short lived and i snapped out of it .
 as to the unstable relationships ,  i can understand chiu cannot accept such a situation .
 this is not postulated by me from theories .
 it is life &apos;s practical lessons .
 this is how the game is played .
 chiu oni get stability after chiu marry .
 before that ,  each has a choice to end it .
 she has a free choice .
 chiu may want it badly .
 she can bail out any time she wants .
 this is what my first gf taught me .
 i dated her 7 years .
 was so sure she was the one .
 gave her all assurances i will always love her (how stupid was i ?
 ) even proposed to her .
 she balked at the idea .
 eventually she saw a banker colleague .
 she is a banker .
 didnt even have the courtesy to tell me we were off .
 cos i was too predictable .
 nothing hooks a lady more than a thriving romance .
 of attraction and uncertainty .
 watch some korean dramas to understand why
 well since we cant help the bbfas maybe we can help the ssfa auntie  .
 tell us more about yourself ,  what are chiu looking for ?
 bbfa here ,  waiting for rcp to save me from my own bbfa-ness
 this thread is so funny .
 10 years of courtship ,  married since yr2001; a total of 30 years .
 was a bui bui 30 years ago .
 instead of subjecting your neighbours to smell your rotten corpse ,  why not sacrifice your body to do some charitable work before chiu go .
 chiu know ,  mask up ,  meet up and let it be a sweet night for an anonymous bbfa here .
 no one has to remember anything the next day if they dont want to .
 chiu will definitely make his day !
 and maybe yours hehe 
 in the end how u get your waifu ?
 chop chop settle within 2year of courtship ?
 my waifu is my 2nd  &apos;official &apos; gf .
 if there is such a thing as official haha .
 i knew her in uni .
 she is a private banker .
 dated her 9 years .
 we are now married 21 years and have 4 kids .
 i oni started to date when i was 24 ,  married to my ex-wife when i was 29 oni for her to cheat on me 4 years later .
 trust me ,  the pain of that was worse than not having a relationship .
 how did chiu find out ?
 so young wanna get married liao ?
 later age 30 divorce and get pawn by wc every month pay maintenance
 but chiu got eat outside these 21 years right ?
 one of the greatest lie society has taught chiu is that chiu need to  &apos;find love &apos; in order to be happy and have a fulfilling life .
 i see that there &apos;s something wrong with your mindset .
 there is no such thing as  &apos;this lifetime ,  next lifetime &apos; .
 this lifetime is all we get .
 i want to eat outside .
 like restaurant food ,  hope the gal comes along
 23 year old oni  .
 still very yang .
 nothing wrong with bbfa .
 but u wan to court girls as a bbfa then good luck .
 dont say u dont have choices as a bbfa u have but most likely u will end up as another average couple  .
 the choice is urs u can change if u wan to change .
 if not dont complain
 i dont think i ever complained about being alone  im actually enjoying it .
 im oredi planning where to go next at month end .
 going alone most likely to ce la ve .
 or maybe a change of venue at last min .
 no matter where i go alone ,  im confident i will still enjoy myself .
 came in and left disappointed .
 i was expecting step sister stuck in washing machine
 some folks wanted to buy oximeters cos their parents lost their flyers .
 others didn’t want to collect as they had oredi gotten their own oximeters last year .
 yet others want to make some money selling their free oximeters from temasek foundation .
 ** where to buy ?
 temasek foundation have no plans to sell its oximeters .
 those who wish to have extra oximeters ,  may consider buying online ,  from lazada ,  shopee ,  qoo10 ,  or even carousell .
 various common brands would go from under $10 to around $30 .
 for the rest who have their flyers ,  collection of free oximeters is over a month from day before yesterday monday 5 july ,  to thursday 5 august just before national day .
 ** where to collect ?
 these may be collected by presenting your flyer ,  with the redemption tab ,  or just use the redemption tab ,  at the participating outlets at: .
 just present your flyer or redemption tab to any cashier at these outlets .
 the cashier will scan and retain the redemption tab ,  and give chiu the free oximeter .
 the scanning is linked to the warehouse system so that the participating chains know when to send top up supply .
 the physical tab is kept as part of quick audit for reconciliation .
 yup ,  there is sometimes a method in our madness !
 around 300 outlets in total - not all outlets could participate ,  as some are quite small and do not have the space to carry inventory .
 if the outlet doesn’t have ,  or has run out for the day ,  just pop in to other nearby outlets or come back another day .
 the prime supermarket folks have oso reached out to see if they could help with the free collection .
 big thanks to them for their interest to help .
 temasek foundation folks are working with them to see if they can come on board in the next week or so .
 ** didn’t get your flyer ?
 for those who haven’t received their flyers ,  please call 1800 738 2000 to leave your name ,  contact number and address .
 these cases will be escalated to singpost for further checks .
 yah ,  there are some folks who try to get extra oximeters to make more pocket money on carousell .
 selling on carousell is fine - others who need them could buy them from carousell or buy others from other online platforms .
 the flyers don’t look like some spam mail from property agents ,  right ?
 but trying to scam the temasek foundation folks is not fine .
 those who genuinely had a problem can called 1800 738 2000 to leave their name ,  contact number ,  and address .
 the call centre will pass on to the temasek foundation folks ,  who will evaluate and contact the affected folks in the next couple of weeks .
 for cases of non delivery ,  the folks will escalate to singpost to check and rectify if needed .
 no promises ,  but i know the temasek foundation folks and others helping will do their best .
 they are good hearted and thoughtful folks who are trying their best to help others wherever they can ,  esp during this covid pandemic .
 **what will temasek foundation do with any balance oximeters after 5 aug ?
 a small balance will be kept to enable exchange for any faulty oximeters up till end august .
 the balance will be donated to moe for distribution to students ,  teachers and staff ,  in schools .
 so don’t worry about balances with temasek foundation ,  hor ?
 they will all be put it to good use for others .
 temasek foundation had been donating oximeters to places like nursing homes for seniors in singapore ,  and to other countries since last year .
 so this is just a stay prepared initiative: .
 - to help people learn more about the risk of silent covid pneumonia; .
 - learn to use an oximeter; .
 - to familiarise ourselves with our own levels of oxygen intake so we know when to get help .
 ** what to do if chiu have a faulty oximeter ?
 just go to the temasek shophouse during operating hours ,  and bring along your oximeter with its box and other items in the box .
 one lady did that ,  and was so happy !
 turned out her oximeter was in perfect working order .
 it was just batteries not working .
 replace batteries ,  and she took her own readings .
 happiness beamed from her big bright smile !
 and the team cheered !
 ** what else to watch out for ?
 the next stay prepared exercise will be for disposable medical grade surgical masks ,  and disposable n95 masks .
 watch for news after national day .
 after that ,  it will be another for povidone iodine (aka pvp-i) mouth gargle ,  which could be used as mouth spray .
 this is currently planned for sep/oct period .
 more about these after national day .
 that’s all ,  folks .
 cannot just say local dont want .
 please refer to our population ratio .
 actually chiu can get online with free shipping for < $15 .
 how would anyone want to make few dollars selling the temasek ones ?
 this is not newsworthy .
 an mrt trip to and flo to collect from any place would oredi cost $4-$5 .
 ownself earn sky high salaries .
 her entire family salary oso paid by tax payers leh .
 don’t see her feel paiseh about it
 someone once said ,  what &apos;s wrong with collecting more money .
 change collecting to earning is same same
 earn some dignity ,  got wrong ?
 am not surprised .
 if ordinary singapore folks are rich enough ,  will we have to resort to this ?
 people give free things that chiu dunnid ,  why no sell ?
 or oni can buy high sell low ?
 if house rent out ,  tenant can collect ?
 die liao die liao .
 carousell kena mark liao
 those who extra not scare kena shame meh .
 who starts the ball rolling n everything abt $$$ (gdp) ?
 temasek foundation money come from where ?
 i feel they should be contributing more $$$ to our gahment to spend on citizens rather than this marketing exercise .
 sinkies are always pawning sinkies
 so much of talk from empress dowager cixi .
 power is an infinite element .
 when the old man was alive ,  where was she ?
 if she was to place her son as the third generation pm of this country ,  it would spell the end of singapore .
 ensuing in its path would be doom .
 sinkies really cheapskate .
 people give u free u don’t need then u collect and resell .
 if u have proper morales u can list it for $0 so people who need it can obtain it without cost as it was provided to u without charge either .
 or better yet ,  just don’t collect .
 i’m sure the organisers can find a way to donate the remaining to needy users
 front grill like become smaller
 too little power leh .
 my current car oredi 6s to 100kmph and i find it low power
 can easily stage 1 it to 230 bhp .
 with the kind of body size and weight anything below 210 bhp and low torque is under power .
 cries at the price
 the emblem on the hood will be retained ?
 if want to buy e class ,  should buy at least e250 ,  e300 .
 a bit overpriced cos is a new model ,  but c&c does offer high trade in so the effective price could be just arounf $250k range .
 moi favuorite chocolate bars is: .

 then how to rebuild ?
 those cmi jc or strawberry poly are the worst .
 i remember most of the cb ns sergeant from there one .
 ocs all the cmi leaders one and most likely help one another .
 during my time they always claim that sispec is more siong than ocs .
 not sure abt it cos i’m just lowly cpl lol
 not true ,  it depends if the company is officer-led or warrant officer-led .
 ocs is mostly mental torture/training after 1st term .
 sispec/scs is alot more physical and training to work as a section/platoon .
 in my honest opinion sispec/scs trains u better rather than ocs .
 occifer oni thinks abt themselves
 he use the wrong term la .
 but the gist of the message is still there .
 there is very few things the recruit need to huan loh after last parade .
 the most is work on fitness or ask your bunkmate for help if u slow learn for things like tech handling test or do thing like smartest 4 or shiny kiwi boots if u very on .
 reservist until 55 years old .
 no ocs one 40 yrs old
 ocs quite nua one ,  probably the toughest part for me was rifle cleaning into the early morning before u are allowed to sleep after field camp lol .
 very relak one lei .
 not commando lei .
 u tell me tough ki lan .
 even sgd cdo oso not siong one
 their training not suitable for us bbfas la
 ah yes ,  now that chiu put it this way ,  i can agree with chiu .
 actually ,  during ns ,  being a sergeant/officer is a real pain in the arse cos chiu cannot just let go after last parade .
 what’s the biggest heartland in singapore  ?
 i am staying in 4room hdb .
 2021 property tax was about $64 .
 just received my property tax for 2022 and i have to pay about $86 !
 that is an increased of about 34% !

 omg $12 cannot afford .
 $1 more a month .
 what’s the annual value of your house
 my property taxes over 5k per year .
 who chiu have voted for first ?
 why pay extra tax to feed the filthy pap
 well everyone loves it mah .
 no evidence to say anyone is against it .
 no one asked for apology either .
 walan property tax so low still come here complain
 so when increase rent and selling price of your property nobody publish on newspapers that they earn so much
 technically it is $22 more and not $12
 my parents 5room .
 about 28% increased .
 i don seemed our pay oso up that much lor .
 that makes $1 .
 80 more a month .
 the whole family of 10 is going to starve to death .
 your pay increase yearly ?
 cos property tax dun
 i am just pointing out your miscalculation .
 did i say anything about the increase ?
 inflation occurred yearly too .
 with covid  ,  many co freeze wages increment lor
 by % really alot !
 did our property went up so much  ?
 normal as in not those super rich or with powers (like rule a country .
 he is really most satki right now .
 usa with all its might cant even do anything to him .
 they can oni bang their own balls for letting him slip out of the country .
 cant even do anything russia other than making noise .
 why would usa do anything to its own cia agent spy ?
 i think jho low is the most satki ,  now where oso dunno .
 snowden ,  an american with conscience ~
 the damage is done liao .
 what is the point of chasing him ?
 and cannot be like everyday go send people to say he liar and everything he say is propaganda right ?
 he &apos;s still young ,  long life in front of him .
 he &apos;s going to slip up one day ,  then he will find himself forever in an american prison .
 could be a spy for us .
  the revealation of us gahment spying on its own citizens could be a guise to get other country to accept him .
 spy world can be very complicated .
 now there &apos;s people labeling him as a spy .
  lol america is full of low life nonsense
 if he went to uk like other guy ,  then gong xi gong xi .
 chiu are referring to the wikileaks assange ?
 yeah ,  now rotting indefinitely in uk prison .
 live in russia shiok meh ?
 he how to live survive .
 his money from where .
 he living which country now
 i think the russian will not trust snowden too .
 he is there seeking a shelter ,  all it takes to putin to warm up to biden or whoever with the intent to bring snowden back to the us shore ,  snowden is a goner .
 snowden is a great bargaining chip for putin .
 he probably still have cia secrets ,  thats why the russian are still providing a safe haven for him .
 nithing wrong with making $$ .
 is the ceca in me .
 pap tell us to integrate what ~
 what &apos;s wrong with making money ?
 apparently there’s a different between something chiu have oredi collecting every month as norm ,  vs something chiu just started to collect it the first time .
 dont say liddat la .
 the reverse oso got where those people bought new item realize no use and give out free .
 can see this in scratchback .
 this is especially apparent for those unfortunate business venture ,  where the business owner give free stocks .
 so is one rice feed all walks of live case ,  not all as cheapskate as bro thought one .
 maybe it &apos;s not sinkies ?
 now sinkie core contains cecas
 trying to deflect from her stupid decision to use flyers .
 like opening a pandora box .

 bro ,  love yourself first .
 singapore - getting a booster shot with either the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid vaccine further reduces the risk of infection by over 60 per cent .
 those who had taken a moderna booster shot after two doses of pfizer-biontech saw a further reduction in infection risk by 72 per cent ,  while those who took a pfizer booster shot after two jabs of the pfizer vaccine saw a 62 per cent reduction .
 the statistics was shared by health minister ong ye kung on monday evening (nov 15) at a virtual press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on covid .
 he said that the health ministry had recently done a study on the relative effectiveness of pfizer and moderna vaccines as booster shots in terms of reducing infection risk ,  and compared the two combinations .
 one possible combination is three consecutive shots of the pfizer vaccine (two regular jabs and one booster) while the other combination is a moderna shot after two regular doses of the pfizer jab .
 mr ong noted that results for other combinations ,  such as a pfizer shot after two doses of moderna jabs ,  do not have large sample sizes and hence may not yield meaningful statistics .
 mr ong and singapore &apos;s director of medical services kenneth mak both took the moderna shot after two jabs of the pfizer vaccine .
 mr ong oso explained why singapore &apos;s reported vaccine coverage of 85 per cent appears to be lower than the reported figures in some other countries .
  &apos;this is cos some countries report vaccine coverage against the eligible population ,  whereas we report vaccine coverage against the total population ,  &apos; he said .
 this means that of the remaining 15 per cent who are not vaccinated ,  1 per cent of them are not living in singapore ,  9 per cent are children below 12 and not eligible ,  and the remaining 5 per cent are eligible but chose not to be vaccinated ,  he added .
  &apos;so if we recalculate this based on eligible population ,  we are around 94 per cent vaccinated .
 it is one of the highest coverages in the world .
 moh will provide both figures henceforth in our daily press release to give a fuller picture of the progress of our vaccination exercise ,  &apos; mr ong said .
 which has higher risk  ?
 two pfizer + moderna booster seems to be the most effective combination .
 i went with pfizer for the booster though as the earlier two shots of pfizer had no side effects .
  ditto for the booster .
  other than slight soreness in the arm for a day .
 not going to get booster
 why never study mm + p and mm + m ?
 compared with 3 doses of moderna how ?
 oyk was correct~  
 sinovac/sinopharm still trying to play catchup to mrna 2 jabs with 100 jabs of their own .
 i discussed with some people they all agree the thing is if u have p p or m m and have no side effect its no guarantee the third different shot wont give u problem ?
 if u want to play it safe get p p p or m m m ,  if u want better protection but must accept more risk then take the mix ?
 of cos this is not saying take it p p p or m m m will be 100% safe either ?
 wtf sino x 2 + pfizer = 95% .
 pofma wanbao now !
 doesnt matter which combination to take ,  all will end up killing chiu .
 how about unvax with zero jabs ?
 so mm is too strong no need boost ?
 if your body oredi familiar with pp or mm .
 better go with ppp or mmm .
 why risk it with something your body might have an adverse reaction to ?
 no matter what combination ,  died alryd means got underlying .
 end up still will get even thought paper specs say until got hill got mountain .
 so that big pharma can collect more data as the vaccines are still in the phase 3 trail .
 same but with mild chest pain .
 my friends who took moderna all complained of much more severe pain .
 not gonna die pain la ,  but more pain than i felt .
 so i rather stick with pfizer .
 plus i had my annual flu jab too .
 but those who prefer lighter skinned partners are oso racist what ,  why they dont choose their own same skin fellow 
 dont like move on lor ,  why must kpkb online ?
 i dont get it .
 chiu kpkb online these people will say sorry ,  change to  &apos;all race welcome &apos; ?
 i always say ceca here will make problem ,  and as the number and power grow .
 the more they will make demands , 
 curryna huat am moi reading ?
 lgbt oso want to complain about racism .
 it &apos;s the pot calling the kettle black
 do chiu see anything peaceful in south asia ?
 why u expect they will be peaceful when the number grow ?
 u cant even call them india anymore
 it is preference definitely  .
 however ,  nwadays there are certain groups of people who likes to stir preference into something esle .
 these stir-ers are those who made us into what it is today .
 cos for some dumb reason minorities cant be called racist .
 same in parliament 
 and alot of our younger generation are being brain washed by such thinking
 and u call yellow as urine .
 its what inside your heart
 gotta agree that it &apos;s not abt racism ,  just personal preference .
 like a marriage ,  people here mostly would find someone of their own skin anw ,  not outside the circle  .
 latter still few & far between i .
 i am totally ok if indians ,  germans  ,  french ,  africans don’t want to date me .
 i wouldn’t even think it’s racist .
 minority of the minority
 then landlord state prefer certain nationality as tenant oso racist .
 if a few people dont like chiu then is racist .
 if everyone dont like chiu hor ,  u better look inwards
 just making a comparison but chiu seem triggered .
 i guess it got to chiu .
 as much as i wouldn’t want to rupture further nerves on your end ,  my point is made .
 simi sai oso racist .
 this sjw nonsense getting out of hand
 in ghey world is full of discrimination .
 if u are not muscular with good looks and young ,  u will be discriminated
 do we even have cathrynli simps in edmw ?
 next time ask atb to dress up in wonderwoman costume n piak
 looks like no strength to even walk or jump .
 seems her sword got thinner too .
 thats why drink bubbletea to be fatter
 real wonder woman have armpit hair of course .
 the above is fake .
 will she fake suicide again if ig dont have enuff likes ?
 this the siaolang that attempt suicide right
 single childless can be wonder woman har ?
 when is she committing suicide again ?
 moi want to be batman
 m &apos;sian influencer cathryn li shares photo of suicide attempt on instagram ,  deletes post shortly after .
 saw her very big expensive house .
 dunno what is she upset about .
 so rich and chio and still got mental issues .
 little bit explode liao ,  very draining for sure .
 this one is fake one
 no gal gadot no talk
 i dunno much about her .
 is she some super ask  ?
 or she got very good earning power  ?
 she seems to be single .
 thought she sweetside uplorry oredi ?
 where the comment ?
 i prefer chocolate ice cream .
 very good to eat those in singapore weather
 moi favourite but need the semi dark .
 van houten ftw !
 moi favourite too .
 but no more liao 
 i didnt know that lol .
 gone for how long oredi ?
 the expensive ones that i can kope from others without paying a cent
 ever managed to find in thai but think they discontinued .
 not really a chocolate person but i will occasionally eat: .
 ate few years ago and never look back .
 but its really expwnsive so oni once a while buy treat moi self .
 must hide awat  from kids 
 reminds me of my childhood dayzzz  
 my childhood favourite .
 but i feel not easy to find .
 i go ntuc often and couldnt find it there .
 chocolate origin not bad right ?
 their dark chocolate cake and their soft serve
 edmw bbfa like van houten
 they can use cpf to buy one 2 room apartment and no more mthly ,  still own the place ,  can sell later but instead choose pay 2k for a rental unit to live independently from parents
 we need more of such poor financial decision to support our property market .
 good for landlords .
 and property prices .
 so let them be .
 if they dont heed your advice .
 just be on the winning side .
 how many such people in 30s renting ?
 heppi can liao .
 those 30+ people still hope to merry wifey and apply btos next time .
 wont waste their time buy a 2rm when single since it will oni make potential zhabors hiam their low ses status .
 better rent 2k condo to attract potential wifey to piak and preggy for marriage
 building flat is long term lease too
 yes terrible decision .
 liddat then can support rental market .
 support rental market means supporting your property values
 analyst will tell chiu to rent and invest surplus money that will give chiu better returns than buying property .
 i know someone who rent condo while waiting for a bto cos his wife cant stand living with his parents .
 lots of people with different circumstances la .
 im not sure if chiu actually did the calculation of buying vs renting .
 at current price point ,  i actually think renting is more worth it .
 save the ultra big downpayment .
 renting is cheaper than instalment + maintenance fee + maintenance of house .
 forgo interest earned (assuming 1+2 from cpf) .
 last year i checked (not now) ,  renting a 4 bedder condo is $3 .
 8k in renovation and very good condition .
 instalment for that house is $4k+ ,  downpayment few hundred thousands .
 ps: if chiu are comparing with a 2 room bto ,  then this calculation wont work though one needs to wait for a few years to get one .
 35 years old + 5 years waiting = 40 years old then get to move out .
 they have the money to waste
 chiu have to understand ,  oni those 35 years of age and above can buy a flat using cpf .
 many are in their early 30s and still single and they dont want to live with parents ,  so no choice but to rent an apartment .
 1 room apartment easily cost 2k already
 condo got all the facilities leh
 they happy is can liao
 people got money .
 some people even make that amount in less than couple of hours in the stock market .
 more than what u make a month
 these guys are good for property market as it oni increases demand for property .
 when demand goes up and supply remain constant ,  its huat time .
 if full serviced apartment then maybe it &apos;s worth it .
 ok some people dont think like some people .
 if ftcan afford it why sinkies cannot ?
 ib cant count properly no wonder degenerate to be an ib
 mine went from $1 , 980 to $2 , 040 ,  but annual rental yield increased by $2 .
 4k this year ,  so not so bad .
 actually less after adjusting for inflation .
 this is nothing compared to petrol tax .
 my mum just handed me the property tax letter .
 my week long salary not enough to pay .
 it makes it so much different
 to me we could still afford the increased .
 imagine those low income families  ,  jobless sole bread winners and so on .
 a few dollars to them is alot of money .
 i am jobless and stress over this increase now .
 actually  i oso never rent out leh .
 why increase huh ?
 the valuation thingy is based on u rent out right
 so fast come in liao ?
 it just makes chiu look like chiu cant do simple math
 the point is if u are stuck in a dead end job with nowhere to go and oni suffer such expenses increase ,  look at the mirror and ask why .
 tks for pointing that out .
 why should company give u increment if u do the same job year in year out ?
 taxi business is really bad .
 i heard from my cousin who is taxi driver (60+ years old)  too .
 he told me many drivers returned their car to co (early retirement or not worth driving now as need as earning not even enough to cover rental ,  carpark and petrol)  .
 some wait for economic to be better than drive taxi again .
 occupier property tax is a huge reduction from actual .
 look at the gahment tax collection .
 37 million households in singapore .
 now multiply by $22 increase .
 and 100% are owner occupied .
 that is more than $30 million of extra taxes collected .
 low ses non matured estate leh
 how much this new fit/jazz thing ?
 design getting worst
 freed is better
 for the same generation ,  swift more chio and got turbo ?
 i feel this design is more catered towards women .
 the car in real ,  i fins it not bad looking leh
 cos satki black vios better
 most top up and buy conti hatchback le
 as per the post after .
 lots more option with alternative .
 if chiu are looking for a car ,  lots of choices .
 then why a fit/jazz ?
 85k are those few options nia .
 wtf look damn fugly .
 too girlish liao
 should be the new 1 .
 5l jazz right for that pricing .
 anyways feel the design very jap/minimalist style .
 is more expensive than previous gen
 cos everybody driving honda vezel  ,  no time for fit
 cos the previous model looks nicer and more sporty .
 the new fit looks guniang
 waaaa aunt dino ,  chiu no reason suan me zuo mo ?
 i was just replying someone &apos;s claims that guys have to be tall handsome and rich to have pretty gf .
 i opined its not true cos i am neither tall handsome and rich .
 but hor ,  if chiu really want to hold my hand ,  we can discuss la > .
 1) frequently working late .
 2) bringing phone into toilet (it was not smartphone era; back then we were all using sms to text) .
 3) becoming distant; next to no intimacy .
 4) saw her coming out of a guy &apos;s car at a very unusual location far beyond the normal drop off at our home .
 i trusted my intuition ,  asked for divorce .
 she got pregnant a couple of months after our divorce was finalised .
 lets not blame each other ,  both sides have their own expectations .
 never suan la ,  ask ask oni .
 chiu ownself know what to do can liao .
 by the way never saw chiu for months .
 sorry ,  i dont hold the hands of attached guys  
 thought i was replying a guy .
 nowadays got many guys use cutesy nicks .
 sorry ,  i should have framed my answers better !
 like the movie the legend ?
 but ya lorrrr 23 years old oni .
 out of curiosity ,  when did all these start happening ?
 any red flags before chiu got married which chiu thought nothing of ?
 gotta agree intuition most of the time is right ,  something must have happened to make chiu think that way .
 at least you &apos;re better off now without her .
 i very disappointed in u ah .
 ask chiu be my gf dont want .
 now complain chiu same situation as ts !
 thank chiu sir ,  hope for the best for chiu too
 i think it was a period when my career wasn &apos;t that promising ,  i was struggling .
 to be honest ,  there wasn &apos;t red flag prior to that .
 it just went south suddenly .
 yes ,  taller people have advantages .
 but that does not mean all is lost .
 read my posts here .
 edit: by the way i know a 1 .
 9m guy in his late 30s that have not dated before no matter how much he wants to .
 the girls tell me he is stubborn and socially awkward .
 height is not everything my friend .
 wa this read still going wor .
 for guys  ,  height is of the most important trait honestly .
 that is one of the trait people judge chiu at the first initial appearance .
 shorter guy just look meek  ,  weak and physically unattractive whereas taller guy are just much more confidence and attractive .
 it is much far worst to be a ssfa than to be a bbfa .
 at least with dedication and hard work  ,  weight can still decrease and can still slim down in the most natural way .
 but for height increment  ,  without going through the painful limb lengthening surgery  ,  even if chiu have 10000 billions of net worth there is no way your height can increase .
 in your opinion ,  guy what height then considered short oredi ?
 thank chiu aunt dino
 your online persona really cmi wor
 as long as your girl is shorter than chiu ,  its fine .
 some girls dont even mind being taller than their men eg nicole kidman .
 but thats rare .
 7 is alright ah .
 its whats inside chiu that is more important .
 deaths from break though infections the highest
 the best is probably mix but there is risks too .
 lanjiao + lanjiao = simi lanjiao .
 cb + cb = smcb .
 lanjiao + cb = ljcb .
 cb + lanjiao = cblj  
 i call rubbish .
 since they ventured to mix shots speak volumes of its efficacy .
 should let us do reverse .
 one pfizer dose then 2 sinovac .
 i am still holding out vaccination .
 too many stories from both sides
 0 x 0 x 0 = infinity .
 you &apos;re hired to be thanos &apos; intern .
 cheena technology still the best .
 i no longer trust all these alr
 so after the 3rd jab ,  what &apos;s next ?
 chiu bo read cina or england properly ,  reduction % and effectiveness % meant differently
 why cant they state every line in similar terms .
 one vaccine says effectiveness and for another brand use reduction .
 they just like to add a bit of confusion to the public
 fug this shiit ,  they all out to confuse you
 not so sure about how moh measured .
 but hor ,  there are a few test groups in that nih study ,  the ppm and mmm ones ,  oni 2 groups(1 ppm and 1 mmm) uses 50mcg moderna boosters .
 did they check whether they get the correct data ?
 all other uses 100mcg ones .
 wonder about sinkieland stats .
 then the same nih study actually oso have test groups on mmp ones .
 wonder if enough data to make a statement yet .
 please define the meaning of ‘effective’
 sjws want to control what chiu can say ,  who chiu rent your house to ,  and even who chiu date .
 for a group that keeps calling their opponents nazis ,  they sure act like one .
 when it &apos;s gay and pink dot ,  it &apos;s  &apos;racism &apos; to say  &apos;i prefer chinese men &apos;  .
 when it &apos;s chinese girls ,  it &apos;s  &apos;ok &apos; to say  &apos;i prefer white men &apos; cos  &apos;it &apos;s just a preference &apos;  .
 thats why i have no qualms about this world going to ****ing **** .
 i hope pap gets 99% votes and a ****ing strong mandate and biden forces everyone to wear 10 masks and take 10 vaccines for every illness every other day and eveyone has a tracetogether token inserted in their necks to track their every movements
 so chiu admit it is from your heart
 soon one day they ownself create their own party liao .
 these libtards are telling people chiu cannot have preferences or else chiu are discriminating .
 curious if that gay an neh considered dating his own race though or did he specifically target chinese/malay men ?
 if so ,  isnt he discriminating his own kind ?
 the world is changing rapidly .
 it always starts  from the us and slowly spreads through the world .
 im nt surprise if such videos/topics are created nt by the person himself and rather by syndicates of such agenda .
 ignorant youngsters are the easiest targets to be influence by such .
 therefore ,  parents play a crucial role in educating them .
 truths tends to b manipulated if too many people at the same time twist and turn giving it another name .
 95% of racisms are actually just preference being manipulated by bad people to fit their evil agenda  .
 using western narrative for the 160th agenda .
 when it comes to racism ,  it &apos;s really not an apple to apple comparison between west and east .
 chiu want doesnt mean other people want .
 then when people dont want ,  cry .
 isnt it know that the gay community is extremely racist ?
 more racist than the heterosexual community
 what &apos;s wrong with having a preference ?
 if it disadvantage them ,  its call racism .
 but when they have sexual fetishism for other race ,  they say preference .
 then spg who pick oni angmo is racist too ?
 chao gheys jskm !
 spgs are not racist .
 they ,  like the useless pap scum ,  open legs to everyone but locals .
 article poorly written .
 dunno what they pointing out .
 when comes to relationship is all preference .
 just some dejected people trying to stir racisim .
 if some one dont like durian chiu cannot force feed them right ?
 or force someone watch football or horror .
 or in this case is heto rejecting chiu consider homophobic ?
 preference la dood
 next time even if ure not gay u cannot reject them i think
 yeah and the same person probably rejects a fat gay bbfa .
 probably citing preference of course .
 so ghey dont eat brack dick is lacsim
 near the anchorvale shing shiong supermarket beside the sengkang stadium .

 people die every day ,  what &apos;s new ?
 twitter is blocked in cheena .
 they are not even trying now .
 the report is in engrish ,  we cant trust reports written in engrish .
 cgtn didnt report this news so it &apos;s probably fake .
 for xi jinping and for our motherland !
 they learn the trick from hitler about the importance of propaganda .
 the role of newspapersclick here to copy a link to this section​newspapers in germany ,  above all der stürmer (the attacker) ,  printed cartoons that used antisemitic caricatures to depict jews .
 after the germans began world war ii with the invasion of poland in september 1939 ,  the nazi regime employed propaganda to impress upon german civilians and soldiers that the jews were not oni subhuman ,  but oso dangerous enemies of the german reich .
 the regime aimed to elicit support ,  or at least acquiescence ,  for policies aimed at removing jews permanently from areas of german settlement .
 nazi propaganda had a key role in the persecution of jews .
 learn more about how hitler and the nazi party used propaganda to facilitate war and genocide .
 the tiong propaganda is not even subtle ,  is very obvious and in your face yet they get all mad when called out for it lmao !
 their intention is not to spread to their own people cos twitter is banned in cheena .
 it is to spread to people who are not citizens of cheena in order to gain operatives like dickson to help spread their falsehood in order to make other countries citizens support the ccp regime .
 here oso alot of ccp wumaos ibs .
 but after fica way lesser liao .
 so it &apos;s pretty obvious where they are coming from .
 heard safari got app that helps to block ads .

 ever since technology ,  machinery starts n improves ,  people r destroying our earth at an alarming speed ,  forgetting that each n every one of us is just a traveller on this land  .
 ‘’i must repent oso .
 oni libtards and sjws think they can shape the earth ,  negatively or positively .
 thats why mao failed in his tiongland engineering .
 but modern libtards will not give up the idea .

 it is like she is so rich that her friend will tell her that her fart smells good .
 still miss her white triangle pic .
 actually she &apos;s very sad kind , ends up attention seeking online
 chiu can see her past videos .
 i dont think chiu really have any true friends when chiu are so super rich .
 every one is just close to chiu to gain some benefit .
 as i was sharing with my friend the other day ,  at least let me enjoy the super rich life for a while before i become enlightened .
 got people complain my sig same as yours is lewd
 your fault lor

 10 years of surplus gone to useless causes like phv /taxi and jss in smes

 what i heard is best not to mixed the vaccine .
  chiu dunno what will happened when two differents type of vaccine comes into contact .
 maybe chiu will know the results few years later .
 risk of infection means what ?
  will it be same in high risk areas or low risk ones ?
 cos we upgrade to elantra liao 
 all the low ses beng driving fit/jazz oredi  &apos;upgraded &apos; to vezel la .
 need fit/jazz for what ?
 rather buy vezel
 look like some bloated goldfish
 they are saving for retirement
 alot bbfa triggered .
 u mean helping the landlords save for retirement .
 last time i used to rent 2-bedder at $3 , 150 per month .
 that time i was 29 years old .
 why didn’t i buy a condo ?
 cos i couldnt afford the upfront downpayment - it was a killer .
 at the same time ,  living with my parents was not an option .
 so family and financial circumstances pushed me towards renting rather than buying .
 it’s easy to always say young adults renting are idiots ,  but everyone’s circumstances are different - as long as they can afford to pay their rent punctually without having to starve ,  what’s the issue ?
 not everything can be measured with money .
 good friendship ,  camaraderie ,  freedom from montrous parents and elder siblings ,  etc .
 no head no tail
 rich landlords agree 100%
 what u dunno is they had oredi bought a new condo ,  so to avoid absd have to rent .
 they are huat but of course wont tell u
 i do think it &apos;s a waste of money but it &apos;s their business so i frankly dont care .
 their money ,  they can do whatever they want with it .
 most of them have well to do parents anyways if going by those recent st articles about those youngsters renting flats to stay on their own .
 maybe they rent out their own property at 3k leh .
 rent from chiu at 2k lo
 35 year old buy bto .
 wait another 7 years for the house .
 nope it &apos;s something that they probably have to do ,  not necessarily need to do but they  are able to do it .
 so im not going to judge that .
 2k rental the condo sure very small or ulu ulu .
 what &apos;s the point of renting then ?
 it is a waste of money to me but i cant judge for others .
 however ,  i am glad to live alone now cos my mum is super ultra disturbing when i wfh .
 why do u need to pay 3150 ?
 one masterbedroom rental not enough ah ?
 arent we all renting our flats ?
 hdb oni 99 years lease 
 if relationship with parents sucks and chiu hate them = move out .
 if relationship with parents is good then give your parents money instead .
 own people get money better than give others money .
 single below 35yo cannot buy hdb leh .
 some people prefer living alone ,  dont want live with other strangers or they rather live with someone they know
 people want whole flat so more freedom .
 never say good times huat until what ?
 why they dont believe pap saying there is light at the end of the 2-year tunnel
 @wlalala this one your restoran ah ?

 without the live gig ,  they are nothing special .
 the whole stretch of holland v got better food and cheaper drinks than them .
 i think the live performance will be coming back in year 2022 .
 the operators need to be patient .
 once the live performance is permitted ,  i think the prices for entry ,  foods and drinks will be revised upwards to make up for the lost time .
 i think the landlord will oso increase the rental soon .
 im 30++ and i notice a very tiny thin spot on the crown .
 maybe stress from work and not balding .
 chiu heng heng escape liao .

 work in kitchen one asp bald faster i think
 dont fap too much
 dont think so much .
 i thought i was losing hair/ thinning at 25 onwards .
 (due to work environment etc) .
 indeed i was ,  due to harsh chemicals ,  wrong products etc .

 i dont wear helmets now for work and used organic products as much as possible now since then and condition is quite similar to 10 years later .

 chiur fate is sealed .

 time to be strong !
 there is a potent computer virus out there .
 to ensure that our internal network does not get compromised ,  all employees must install anti virus software and the latest patch .
 all employees are forbidden from accessing the internet to minimize risk of downloading the virus .
 all contractors and guests using our wifi network should have anti virus installed on their laptops .
 we trust that they would perform a virus check each time before logging on to our network .
 once done ,  they are free to log on to our wifi network to access the internet and intranet .
 in my company contractors have access to unrestricted/unfiltered guest network .
 this is sitting in the internet dmz and is outside the company network .
 they need to use a secured vdi client to access intranet .
 this airgaps the intranet from their machines .
 we do have employees have no internet access rights - mainly those working sensitive roles this is enforced using identity based networking .
 if chiu in the no internet ad group ,  chiu don’t get proxy access .
 yes ,  chiu should to avoid malware ,  virus and ransomware
 have to access internet to get some info la sometime how can totally cut off
 my company provide inhouse jav website to guest network .
 so guest no need to access unknown jav website
 this type of policy can accept ?
 yes all good legit companies trust based on goodwill effort
 all non-employees should have 100% restricted guest-only accounts to internet .
  the oni site they are allowed to visit is pornhub .
  they can stay there till the virus issue is resolved .
 or maybe laksa and mee siam ?
 if chiu or your friend cant even bother to look at their website which lists the services they offer .
 maybe the job is not for chiu or your friend .
 sell membership and insurance
 international driving licence  
 brand is  &apos;auto  &apos;
 auto = automatic .
 mobile = moving object .
 so they selling automatic moving stuff .
 so likely selling animals .

 aas is annamalai alumni of singapore .

 no ,  dont have to know anything .
 just sit there play hp whole day .
 it is the same as the rich telling the poor that  &apos;money does not bring chiu happiness &apos;  but if given a chance whether they would like a role/wealth reversal for life  ,  no rich people would be stupid enough to swap .
 money does bring chiu happiness/advantages/power in life in which the rich sometime simply choose not to acknowledge least they appear themselves to be shallow/judgmental/arrogant where the matters of fact that there is far more advantages and benefit in being rich .
 the same with height as well .
 guy who are of taller build with good genes would not understand .
 i guessing chiu should be of average height 1 .
 refer to my the other post .
 u will get your answer
 believe it or not ,  below 1 .
 i know what i am talking about 
 7m is short but then some girls like short guys just like some guys like old girls or fat girls or tall girls .
 just find those who like short guys .
 but still i’m happy that i’m not and did not face this problem
 chiu are one to say .
 but i never had a girl that i am interested in tell me i am short .
 hello ,  we are guys .
 we do the picking ,  no ?
 or chiu dua bai let girls approach chiu one ?
 pick pretty flowers shorter than us la .
 most singapore girls are below 1 .
 what &apos;s the issue ?
 the most is same height .
 no need bend down to kiss .
 are chiu the girl that did the youtube videos ?
 u like same height doesn’t mean the other like same height .
 if short is not a crime ,  i think edmw will have half the threads and edmwer online .
 still i pray for them .
 to one day find someone who truly don’t mind them .
 but still ,  i hope ts and whoever can have mental preparation .
 just find another one
 i havent come across anyone who openly declare that they have fetish for or like short guy  ,  majority 99% would choose the taller build .
 honestly if im a gcp  ,  i wouldnt go for short guy either .
 girls who  &apos;suddenly &apos; like short guy generally fall into these category .
 1) >=35 years old and biological clock is slowing down  ,  had her fair share of fun in her younger day and would want to settle down but would not find a ideal tall guy  ,  have no choice but to downgrade to  &apos;short guy &apos; .
 2) single mum with kids .
 3) short guy is filthy rich
 filthy rich oso doesn’t mean get someone if their mind and personality ,  the whole person as a whole ,  really makes people irks until cannot even stand the idea of being with him .
 oh ,  i may have mistaken your point .
 if u taking about buying a bride ,  like being with someone u don’t love but then somehow the person choose u ,  oso can la .
 like this actually no need open threads to whine about .
 lots of people buy brides .
 just don’t care what others think and don’t expect true love .
 single mum oso won’t be so desperate .
 nowadays women rather be alone than with someone that disgust them .
 i don’t know what era of people like them still exist .
 single good ah  .
 no need to answer to anyone .
 why wanna give up the whole forrest for 1 pathetic tree 
 my friends female .
 rather be single than to be with someone they feel smth is wrong .
 single mum too .
 since one rather be single ,  why would one suddenly be scared when with a kid  ?
 and oso ,  for some women ,  even they got kids ,  still got men who will queue to be the next father .
 some women even no children ,  oso nobody wants .
 (not targeting anyone)  .
 if a person being rich can cover his flaws ,  then that means the person ain’t that bad to be with in the first place .
 if rich still single ,  it just means he has smth so wrong that even money cannot cover his flaws .
 i know ts is not in the last category .
 so all is not lost .
 i have male friends who are  <1 .
 7m but happily attached .
 i oso have male friends >1 .
 8m and single since i &apos;ve known them .
 apart from being easy to hide behind to help block the sun ,  i dont really see any major merits in height leh .
 reminder: i am oso a bbfa  , 
 chiu are the type of guys bro bzzbzz was alluding to .
 instead of improving yourself ,  chiu direct the blame to ladies for passing chiu up cos of your height .
 chiu went on to stereotype women into 3 categories .
 women are not shallow .
 dont mind me say ,  and please do not take offence .
 i reckon the real reason why ladies are not attracted to chiu is cos of your negativity .
 not your height .
 @iamnobodyxxx chiu mean this girl is the youtube one ?
 this is the zeh zeh
 ya height is useless ,  im > 1 .
 8m still single
 every opportunity oso play race victim card .

 their kind of business model is irrelevant in pandemic ,  if they dont want to revamp but wait  .
 then dont kpkb .
 the truth is if their alternatives isnt making sufficient money like takeaway food or renting out the extra space ,  they should just close down the whole place especially if they own the place
 the money from good times 20 years go where oredi ah ?
 if revised upwards ,  people wont come .
 prices will oredi increase due to gst and pap getting back their money .
 so if they add on their own increase ,  it &apos;ll be even worse
 the shareholders can inject more money into the businesses from their own private savings and pledge personal properties to the banks .
 i think we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel .
 this is how one can ride out the pandemic .
 in the long run ,  the business is viable and profitable .
 even right now ,  the company under goes for valuation .
 it is highly profitable and many investors are waiting to take over their business .
 covid has shown us that arts is not a good field to get into
 can make noise and gahment given hand out ,  why need to use ?
 for every unsuccessful restaurants ,  there are 100 others that are successful .
 how come that kpo @ killiney still havent close down ah ?
 always see tons of super cars parked there .
 just close down la ,  wont be opening up anytime soon
 why do they deserve gahment grants in the first place ?
 they &apos;re a business ,  not a citizen or a charity .

 everybody happy can liao
 freedom is priceless   .
 chiu wont fully understand the benefits until chiu stay on your own  .
 the world is changing 
 knew someone bought  a condo and still waiting for completion ( further delay) .
 he straight sell away his hdb and currently rent a condo 3k monthly .
 heard this is crazy planning ,   true ?
 somemore they r supporting landlords .
 edmw hate landlords the most liao .
 until they become landlords themselves
 first day in edmw isit ?
 everything can and will be measured in money terms !
 my colleague did the same thing .
 sold flat before condo completion .
 lived in rental for 1yr .
 renting is a valid cheat code .
 chiu can actually find rentals which are reasonable or even cheap either cos the owners bought the property cheap or the place is quite ulu .
 if it &apos;s acceptable to chiu ,  chiu can actually get like a nice place near the place chiu work and chiu dont have to pay maintenance or even buy furnishings .
 meanwhile ,  nothing is stopping chiu from buying a property to rent out .
 do the sums and if someone can get 3k rental returns while  renting a unit for himself for 2k ,  that is +1k gross every month liao .
 cos the other way is to down 1xx k straight to live in your house .
 buying gives chiu ownership and provides good odds of making a profit / breaking even .
 rental is just unrecoverable cost with no chance of profit / breaking even .
 banks dont earn much from your bank loan  .
 they want chiu to park all those hundred thousands and millions in the banks for them to sell chiu financial instruments to churn chiu daily .
 will earn more 
 thats what someone would say in  .
 continue to rent .
 through the trough of 2009 till the peak of 2015 .
 and now in year 2021 .
 the prices is not going down at all .
 and when it comes down  ,  that person renting will still not be buying cos it justified his decision to rent .
 his rationale was .
 heng i rent ,  if i bought ,  i might have been sitting on a few hundred thousands dollars of loss .
 and fast forward another 10yrs .
 the property price is higher than in 2021 .
 and the cycle continues .
 not saying chiu .
 i am saying the profile of renters are like that
 ok ,  in this case ,  i think still ok .
 cos they are using the condo or hbd fully paid to rent a condo or some place they live .
 2009 to 2011 property prices are cheap and felt cheap then .
 make no sense to rent than to buy .
 it &apos;s just really expensive right now .
 think need to be 35 and above then can buy 2rm bto or resale .
 as a landlord ,  i think renting is a good option for youngsters to learn about independent living and how to manage their individual finances .
 buy condo then no such issues .
 yes many stupid people around who think they &apos;re v satki  .
 but im not like ts ,  so just keep quiet let them look stupid 
 income too high cannot apply 2rm bto ,  and single bto oni give u ulu places  .
 if they can afford 2k rental then u shouldn &apos;t be worry for them cos they too rich
 likely those condo at geylang ,  gulleimard and eunos area there .
 ah bo pick the best of the best mah
 learn from cecaland better ?

 while the primary baldness gene is on the x chromosome ,  which men get oni from their mothers ,  other factors are oso in play .
 the hereditary factor is slightly more dominant on the woman &apos;s side ,  but research suggests that men who have a bald father are more likely to develop male pattern baldness than those who dont .
 sorry to say ,  it &apos;s all genes .
 those balding guys in their late 20s and early 30s .
 their dads oso started balding at a young age .
 in before rub cheesepie zhup
 work hard and become rich and your hair will grow back .

 gotch one party kept talking about taxing the rich and taxing wealth wor .
 sho naw the garment tax the property owners that are obviously richer and wealthier than those that dont own any .
 yet always hear our inflation 2-3% oni .
 everyday food oredi up more than that   .
 when gst increases ,  px of things will increase more .
 the property is not even own to became with .
 we are just renting them for 99 years .
 still need to pay .
 whether u vote for them or not ,  u will still kena from this tax hike if u own the eligible property .
 worse still if u didnt vote for them yet still gotta pay this tax hike .
 sometimes price increase but quality and quantity decrease !
 what &apos;s her background ?
 seems to come from rich family .
 i saw the video footage of her very big house .
 i am oso wondering what business are her parents doing to make them so freaking rich .
 still prefer gal gadot .
 she looks different now
 let us know when she threatens to slit her wrist .
 we will turn up in our poms poms ,  knife sharpeners ,  katanas and give her our fullest moral support .
 who is it gonna be ?
 ps:  must wait how long to make new post now ?
 the airfield is around marina area .

 i was too young to tell ,  was it go ahead ?
 how cum those illiterate aunty  could speak engrish in those era ?
 i was impressed .
 just like sook ching ,  the one where old monkey lee escape from .
 the c+ to hug a visitor .
 liddat spread liao then effective ma
 if have war we can win ?
 lai discuss thoughts .
 not sure about your soldiers but mine are good though 
 mine are very good swimmers .
 each splurt means millions sacrificed .
 in military term it &apos;s a fail 
 some good some bad
 if your soliders are not willing to die for chiu ,  then in military term really means an epic failure
 i oni know raw is war
 are our females good mothers ?
 in before ib says .
  &apos;don &apos;t ask what your soldiers can do for chiu ,  ask what chiu can do for your soldiers &apos; .
  &apos;soldiers do not owe chiu a living &apos;
 i cannot tell but i am sure the encik and their grandmothers are all very good .
 no worries we got imran .
 if war i will be afraid to come back cos i know we will lose badly lol .
 chiu nsmen still dunno what’s our attitude towards reservist ?
 our docile violence-averse society (thanks to pap) .
 means most of our soldiers got no guts .
 once they realize real bullets are flying at them ,  they &apos;ll be running or hiding or freeze .
 once they see their comrades screaming in pain and bloods and guts flying .
 arms and legs blown off .
 our troops will run away ,  screaming like girls .
 with our mickey mouse boy scout paper generals .
 they better make sure they dont run out of body bags and adult diapers .
 fyi i know a guy that is 1 .
 his wife is a chio bu business woman .
 my kids attend her kindergarten .
 my cousin is shorter than me .
 he is a private banker .
 cos all the rich aunties are attracted to him .
 chiu should see the number of girls crying out his house when he was younger .
 i see oredi lao nua .
 chio bu busty xmm .
 chow turtle cousin no intro .
 like i said ,  its not the height but what &apos;s inside a man .
 i’ve oso seen one who is rich but short ugly .
 and never get love .
 i believe your cousin is one with some good characters that actually even no need to be banker oso can get love .
 god bless good souls
 yeah ,  i dont get guys like chiu .
 chiu have mly here telling chiu that as a <1 .
 7 guy he &apos;s gotten a string of girls .
 and you &apos;re just ignoring it .
 chiu can use his example as inspiration for yourself to go out and get a girl for yourself .
 or chiu can ignore him and wallow in self pity .
 why choose the latter option ?
 maybe chiu can start loving yourself first ?
 nowadays gals easily earn 8-10k  .
 they won’t bother if u earn lesser
 cos u not from ri .
 my cousin is damn smooth with ladies .
 3x better than me .
 ok ,  he is 9/10 in the looks department .
 ocbc used him to model for their adverts despite his height disadvantage .
 but take nothing away from the fact he knows how to position himself as don juan reincarnated .
 it takes effort .
 is it too late for me to get a chio bu gf cos all taken oredi ?
 and now we know why the wife is a dead fish in bed .
 treat each other as roommate ,  no common interest at all ,  the common interest is money ,  bto or have a house to live ,  no communication with each other ,  do not live like a couple .
 anyways even if male is confident ,  can take rejections ,  or oni get a girlfriend when they reach around 30+ and above ,  does not mean that when they have a relationship it will be long lasting ,  might be a time bomb .
 there are girls whom i met have no interest in me despite me being confident and what not ,  but when they saw ask wow they become so chatty .
 it is not your fault
 i &apos;ll say this: the hotter the woman chiu are with ,  the more options chiu need to have and chiu need to be able to show it .
 the guy had better know what he is doing cos she has lots of options too .
 but i think oni a very small proportion of people in this forum will be able to appreciate this .
 i have similar experience oso ,  first partner since grad ,  dated long time ,  guy suddenly found new piak ,  no sound and suddenly just up and disappeared .
 we were planning to get married too ,  and i found out later he was dating his colleague ,  married 3 months after he left .
 he never said anything to me or gave any hint while we were together ,  except he &apos;d keep checking his texts .
 i most killed myself afterwards .
 ya looks more impt than height
 hope chiu are recovering alright ,  i was counselling a gal coursemate in my final year of college .
 she oso shared a similar story (got cheated on) .
 this gal fell into deep depression and tried to take her life ,  but failed in doing so .
 currently still seeking psychiatric treatment 2 years after the incident .
 anyway ts u got easy height advantage 1 .
 9m oredi can win most sinkie guys but i think the problem lies with your weight .
 130kg even for your height is extreme ,  it is like x2 of many average height guy’s weight ,  petite girls may scare u crush her on bed .
  but no offence it is definitely something that u can work on if chiu put effort into it .
 even a girl with good facial features or nice firm tits oso will get rejected for her appearance if she is overweight ,  no less different from guys .
 last point maybe is to continue working on your education and earn more money is a huge plus as when chiu reach 25+ girls automatically become more materialistic ,  oso be more extroverted i guess
 lol wa got similar username .
 thank chiu sir for your kind words…i will try to work on my weight 
 try to aim 100kg first but dont lose weight too fast oso ,  not healthy and place alot of stress on your body
 pm oredi  &apos; used to it  &apos;  .
 hope he dont suddenly tumble while giving ndp rally speech .
 so far last year ok  ,  he must be super cautious take many breaks in between unlike his dad lky can talk all the way till the end ,  really the difference of a great leader vs  .
 ng c m now in ntuc oso crappy ,  i can for seem some jinx power coming soon at ntuc ?
 chiu oni need to just say yes can liao
 one got voted out in 2011 .

 i feel heaven oredi keep hinting cannot get ex saf scholars into politics .
 jinx ong from which uniform group ?
 it has to be successful cos chiu have to see who is the first saf oversea recipient .
 ah loong himself oso former saf scholar isnt he ?
 need patton to provide ggg
 heng bro lawrence is not saf scholar .
 jinx ong not saf scholar  .
 need people to look bad .
 same like chio bu always jio average looking ones for selfie or photo taking .
 ong yk is saf scholar  ?
 so far ,  all dynasties from east to west has oni 1 great ruler and once he or she uplorry ,  the dynasty crumbles .

 rot starts from the .
 depend on chiu taking father or mother gene for hair .
 wa this shushu .
 i know u must be having a very deep relationship with your right hand ,  break up with him n u shalll get your hair back !
 huh how are these three items related to gpu ?
 ok now i get it !
 is there any list that updates highest yielding hdb area and condos ?
 wanna see which area has the best price to rental yield .
 high rental doesnt = high yield .
 tiagong is jurong .
 anyone got source or know how to find ?
 chiu want high yeild ?
 look for jumbo
 chiu buy in now just end up pay super high price
 not buying now .
 it &apos;s for studying .
 the earliest i would buy is at least a few years later .
 how to see the yield ?
 what other property type can win ?
 reconfigure two kitchen to become 2 xtra masterbed rm for max yeild
 where chiu get those figures from ?
 all flats buy for own stay .
 not worth buying for investment .
 future supply and demand can change drastically
 punggol cos of ceca inflitration .
 thank me later
 stop trolling can ?
 dunno say dunno .
 chiu got source or not ?
 no source ,  no talk .
 rental yield not high .
 3rm hdb at most so called 7%
 no source no talk .
 thanks for your contribution but need a source for data .
 not just estimated .
 before they get their new condo .
 landed oso do the same
 what about tiagong mps ?
 how to measure them ?
 the other aspect of living on your own and learning to be independent .
 priceless lesson and experience .
 all those bbfa staying with parents and whinning day in day out on hdb ,  cpf ,  foreigners ,  gahment ,  their parents .
 simply cos they never grow up and never shoulder responsibility of the family .
 honestly yes ,  unless they earn big bucks ,  but if salary 3 to 5 k and paying 2k for rent is really gong gong to the max .
 imagine what can u do with 2k monthly .
 im below 30 ,  and im renting a 1 bedroom condo slighty below 2k .
 if i can buy a house ,  i would have bought one .
 but the gahment discriminates .
 rental got freedom ,  no need to tie down for 30 years loan .
 anytime wanna shift just shift .
 if salary cut ,  can downgrade to another cheaper unit .
 buy condo la ,  no restrictions .

 singapore very bizarre .
 the land isn’t yours (and a strata title to boot) but still have to pay taxes on it .
 landlords will not tell u how much more they are getting .
 they will continue to blame gahmen and foreigners .

 punggol digital district .
 chiu are investing in the future .
 that is not the source for highest yield .
 dream long and please live long to see it
 from own experience .
 source for data just go propertyguru and search jumbo unit and do your maths .
 a 3rm combine unit with 55-60yrs left at 4k monthly return will yeild ard 2 .
 7m-3m and thats 200-300% return for yr capital if say the property goes zero .
 otherwise chiu get a chance in lucky draw
 u convert kitchen to masterbed .
 then common room tenant toilet use where ?
 not combined unit .
 is 3rm standalone unit .
 rent out $2500/mth so $30k/yr roughly 7% yield so call
 lol sorry one living room one kitchen  ,  not both
 what toking chiu ?
 is hdb rental moving up recently ?
 jumbo low yeild ?
 the  chiu name an asset with higher yeild ,  i oso interested to know .
 3 person each room can oredi if chiu want play by the rules ?
 legally chiu have two unit number ,  so by right capacity is 6 person x 2 ?
 need property agent to verify this
 cannot use cos looking at a glance the rental yield list is what i need ,  not individually go do own calculations .
 will compare until die .
 what’s chiur budget ?
 i think jumbo unit combine 2 units to 1 .
 leaving oni 1 unit number on door plate .
 rental rules should apply to it as 1 single unit , not 2 units .
 max 6 people live inside i think
 nothing to do with budget .
 asking for a list that can compare ppty yields of different types of properties and areas etc .
 for studying purposes
 jumbo is two 3 room flat combine .
 wth ,  what are these ceca engineers doing ?

 nobody stopping chiu .
 brunei is first class living .
 paying sultan billions to do nothing .
 not about the money !
 i just buay song to give them $22 .
 i rather throw in the drain
 after that still have to pay .
 waiting for the pdf
 most of their fts are actually sinkies .
 nobody kbkp sinkies go there and take other people  jobs ?
 locals are relaxed type and happy that all the thinking jods are done by fts .
 locals are pampered by their benevolent billionaire sultan and their country &apos;s abundant black gold .
 thats still very cheap .
  i just paid about $2k+ for mine .
 like sinkies pampered by pap thinking they should have a good job with a good pay cos they pink ic .
 their citizen benefit is amazingly good .
 gahment all out to rob your cpf
 if pink ic got no benefits .
 take for what  still waste 2 years of free slavery
 your cpf inside not used at all ?
 never give u at 55 ?
 hsk frittered away sgd$100 billion  from singapore reserves .
 they need to raise money to patch up this giant hole .
 i would not even mind if all the sgd$100 biilion  was spent/given to singapore citizens .
 but i have a nagging feeling that at least 40% of that sgd$100 billion passed (by way of a complex web of disbursement) into the hands of foreigners who are working/residing in singapore .
 spending singapore reserves on foreigners is terrible .
 it is almost a sin .
 if anyone can tell me i am wrong and he has proof that 100% of the sgd$100 billion  was spent /given entirely to singapore citizens; and 0% went to foreigners - then i would very happy to be corrected .
 yes in singapore ,  population oso here to serve the rich people and elites .
 very hard to progress upwards .
 brunei system 100 times better than singapore for welfare
 your 2 years of slavery is so that u have a country to call your own and protection of your loved ones .
 which country welcome u with open arms ?
 u think u very talented ?
 we will not progress if we move with the weakest .
 we chop the weakest and run with the best .
 comparing according to percentage leh !
 no sinkie citizen come here to advertise about the handouts they get .
 they just kbkp about how little they get .
 your nagging feeling is your feeling of insecurity and disengaged with the reality .
 i should be damm unhappy i never get handouts .
 but come to think of it ,  i’m blessed that i never qualify .
 dont be ridiculous .
 chiu will be eating much more than 55 sets of mixed vegetable rice in 10 years .
 please find something else to stir .

 what goes around comes around
 many lta ,  tp bike think their riding skill so good and own the road .
 chiong like nobody business .
 service windows like these are a display of power by the chinese communist party or ccp .
 ordinary people need to bow down before them ,  despite the loud and clear manifesto of the ccp and the chinese gahment being  &apos;serving the people &apos; .
 ts ,  chiu better stop looking at my neh neh .

 going feedback forum to ask for pban liao
 bump for opinion .
 cos ahtiong &apos;s song .
 covid has exposed our vulnerabilities in the world and i believe our top mgmt should re-look and re-strategize the long term plans to enlarge our current self-sufficiency capabilities .
 instead of wasting time talking about irrelevant topics like opening up ,  travel bubble etc .
 they just need gdp to meet kpi .
 everything else is collateral damage .
 once kpi hit then bonuses sent to carribean
 we wil see a bleak future if so .
 enlarge kar cheng
 if we had pushed on for chartered semi con
 ddun be xenophobic .
 need cecas to develop covid tests
 alot of skilled trades oredi lost cos given to fts .
 we can always pick them up again .
 they are not lost forever .
 for past 30 years ,  no one at the top ever seriously attempted to make singapore come up with leading tech/science that is essential for the world to operate .
 think tsmc ,  ram tech ,  pharma drugs ,  industrial chemicals .
 all coasting along .
 even worse now ,  population growth gdp without creating significant stuffs .
 strategy is sinkies become new-age coolies ,  similar to other south east asian countries ,  just more sexpensive to hire .
 we need to be self sufficient yet leaders of this country still want to exploit cheaper labour capital from third world country and 61% approve so .
 the pap gahment is run by people who rely on open leg policy and cheap labour to drive economy .
 all of a sudden chiu want them to u-turn and hand over the reins of power to the tech and science experts which can make self-sufficiency happen ?
 let me tell chiu ,  even if the country drop to the level of afghanistan ,  they wont change la .
 chiu try to write proposal to them and try la .
 see whether they will hiew chiu or not .
 leaders will listen to chiu .
 but oni in very very rare cases there will be action .
 look at ceca ,  it &apos;s still going full force despite delta is going to overrun this country .
 their belief is we can never be self sustainable .
 if not they wont keep insisting on open leg policy
 stop being xenophobic ,  if dont let ceca come in then let your favourite jiu hu kia cum in isit ?
 i tell chiu next 2025 election will see at least 75% mandate 
 ever heard of natural selection bro ?
 the universe has worked that way for billions of years and now chiu want to challenge that ?
 pla ,  the j10 is the most imba jet to fly .

 better go cycling in the morning
 still jin hot weather
 haha we shall see .
 ok bring moi sun tan lotion
 for oni 15 minutes .
 when is it ever accurate ?
 said that the entire week will have right ?
 but till now still dont have any rain one .
 when the new first reported 2 weeks of moonsoon ,  hear liao jin happi and excite ,  then after kosong rain at my plc since ,  now say disappointed .
 yesterday got rain in the north mah but not for long .
 today hope likewise but longer .
 neighbouring countries raining big big .
 i teenk it &apos;s coming .
 yesterday 3pm was surprisingly dark .
 ydty afternoon rain liao even more humid lol
 this type of rain i rather dont rain .
 more hot after that .
 i stopped showering so far have been waiting for the big one
 wind big big and smell of rain .
 chiu heard me right .
 i say the unknown man made a high iq move by not closing the loopholes .
 i know what y’all are thinking ,  but hear me out  .
 by not imposing an outright ban and closing the loopholes ,  the unknown man drove the bus down gongjiao way  .
 and by talking about how the loophole-ers will take on the risk profile of the 3rd countries so there is no need to close the loopholes ,  the unknown man effectively transferred the responsibility of banning travellers from india to these 3rd countries ,  without having to further offend india with an outright ban .
 still disagreeing with me ?
 y &apos;all see how once the unknown man took that left turn down gongjiao way ,  maldives and bangladesh panicked and issued ban on travellers from india with immediate effect ?
 yes i know ,  nepal and sri lanka are still procrastinating on jumping on the ban-wagon ,  but nepal oredi start to kio tolong  .
 these countries know damn well why loophole-ers have been coming to their countries ,  and now that the unknown man has made this route  &apos;legit &apos; ,  these countries must now brace themselves for the massive hordes coming their way  it &apos;s now down to how much more these 2 countries think they can tank before they throw their hands up in the air and say £@€# it ,  it &apos;s no longer worth these 14-day tourists &apos; rupees .
 and s &apos;pore comes up smelling like roses .
 change my mind 
 chiu are minister material !
 someone nominate ts to be principal private secretary
 indians need not go to these 2 countries but any other countries will do .
 and if im a country desperate for money ,  i &apos;ll accept them ,  accept their cash ,  isolate them and throw them to singapore .
 and when did i say i &apos;ll ensure they are covid free for singapore ?
 so tell us which countries are accepting people from india who are stumping up $ to get in ?
 i said  &apos;if im a country desperate for money .
 its wholly possible to do it .
 some scholars just assume the world works in the black and white bureaucratic way they do
 of course ,  it &apos;s possible .
 but unless there &apos;re countries actually doing it as a matter of policy (not some individual illegal slipping through) ,  then your counterpoint goes nowhere .
 ts &apos; case is still sound - we are passing the buck to 3rd countries ,  knowing that this will filter off alot of would-be travelers - extra expense/time incurred for extra travel and quarantine ,  plus possibility of testing positive , 
 -laughs in perm-sec-
 liddat is that channel 8 news report to point out the loophole deliberate ?
 took this forum a very long while to figure out the new game .
 u think too much that other countries will read our news for unknown man &apos;s speech .
 nepal they all close is cos they read india news oso scared
 are the swab test from some countries reliable ?
 hok limpeh lazy read ,  oni care about 1 thing ,  cecapore ban liao meiyou ?
 nepal n sri tankan is gg
 what makes u think they cant get infected in those 3rd world countries oso .
 and then pass on to the other travelers there .
 or fake this and that to come to singapore ?
 it oni shows how many of them are oredi in singapore .
 we have become a major importer
 prease dont do to otter huat otter do to chiu 
 yps gets the chicks
 i don’t believe ,  i got belly one especially from the side view   plus i am totally not fit
 no worries ,  i actually oso scared kena exposed but i need the suggestions from bros and sis here 
 @iamnobodyxxx will console chiu .
 if u wanna prevent loose skin then gradual weight loss .
 if u r young then its better .
 start by cutting your calories by 30% spread over the 3 meals so its quite achievable .
 eat more white meat instead of red meat and lotsa vege .
 avoid hidden fats like salad dressing .
 cut off snacking on junk/deep fried totally .
 can have cheat days once a week lor .
 start by brisk walking/swimming not advisable to jog based on your current weight as it will not be good for your knees .
 add in yoga to your exercise regimen .
 and ya takeover all the housework at home    .
 i used to weigh 62 and came down to 50 but i took things slowly so took 3 yrs   .
 this is moi method .
 but if u want fast weight loss theb there is keto diet but i dont think i can do it .
 @kaylin  got suggestions on weight loss methods mah ?
 cb ,  u this kind of size ,  cannpt find gf .
 u more fit than me
 rasin oso can see liao  .
 don’t wear too tight shirt .
 chiu should be wearing long sleeve plan shirt so that it looks better on you
 mayb tummy need to slim down ,  the limbs are not that huge le
 maybe should change your name to localduobuiitguy .
 can hide as duobuiit(big built) .
 dns = cantonese .
 if u have asthma even though controlled best to consult doctor on the exercise part .
 the rest of my dieting methods oredi posted .
  &apos;easiest &apos; is always do low carb high fat (lchf) but must combine with eating less oso cos weight loss is calorie deficit .
 but its easier when chiu can eat fats cos it makes chiu fuller for longer and more satiated .
 i tried extreme weight loss before (2 meal replacement shakes + 1 solid meal) and managed to slim down to 85kg coupled with daily exercises but i was really unhappy and eventually ballooned .
 i am trying to go back to the gym daily now ,  based on some bros recommendation here i oso will try to incorporate weight training instead of pure cardio .
 i have cut off any forms of potato chips since early last year ,  however still cannot stop having that occasional fried food or fast food (average twice a month) .
 in terms of sweet drinks ,  i try to limit myself to once-twice a week (standard can 330ml) .
 as for red meat ,  the last time i had it was early this year .
 may i ask for cutting calories do chiu count them ?
 cos i tried to do that for about a month+ but didn’t find it feasible .
 so for the 30% reduction ,  would it be feasible to try to have a rough calculation of my daily calorie intake > 70% of the target daily calorie intake based on height/weight (basically calorie deficit)
 inonly know 2 of such phrases .
 dllm ( lou mo ,  lou mei)
 want to be slim oso possible .
 all up to chiu .
 i will create a ama thread when i am not a bbfa .
 please join ok .
 i dunno when tho  
 too girlish already
 he say his finances a bit tight now but is confident that he will repay the money with interest latest 6 months later .
 can trust my friend or not ?
 lend money ,  prepare to not get it back .
 dont lend friends .
 bec usually friendship end .
 i lend a few liao .
 6 years oso no see any repayment .
 this is anot simple thread .
 anyway we have no choice as your friend holds the power .
 extension ,  means oredi paying but need additional 3 to 6 months…… .
 since he ask oredi should be ok bah…… .
 be prepared to lose all your money
 liddat jialat la .
 u see them as friends .
 they see chiu as roberto .
 really annoying sia .
 cannot see behind got long queue meh .
 somemore not say alot of items ,  just a few diff noodle bowls thats all .
 why cannot make up the mind then go queue .
 whenever i eat hor ,  i know exactly what i want and prepare the exact change .
 take so long to pick the food ,  then after that take out the money slowly dig inside wallet .
 is it very hard to say auntie #2 picture and give money then stand one corner and wait ?
 and when told how much start to search for their wallets and purses .
 they think the food is free ?
 same like some people .
 reach the gate liao then take out phone or token then prepare to tap the tt pad .
 really wtf sia
 normally these people are slow in personal and work life .
 cause never plan ahead .
 but probably least stressful .
 why cannot prepare 2 x $2 note or $10 note or whatever before ordering .
 i literally do not understand their thought process
 what if the front person is a chio bu ?
 does she get a free pass from chiu ?
 chio bu not counted .
 can take as long as she wants .
 typically is boomer .
 reach the counter then ask ,  “you all got sell chicken wing ?
 ” at kfc counter .
 more dulan those who start digging for loose change after seeing the total amount  .
 plus those who start asking what &apos;s this what &apos;s that when ordering cai png
 me will press kukujiao again her pigu and ask her hurry up
 ya lor ,  cannot tell chicken or pork ah ,  first time order cai png isit ?
 cai png all dish standard one lor .
 i dont like those queue up buying food ,  hawker or fast food ,  when their turn come ,  they can  &apos; hmmm ,  eh .
 ah ,  then say 2 pcs chicken ,  can change this change tat &apos;
 some cb boomers even worse ,  oni want some specific parts .
 saw one in front of me ,  die die wan the guy to kiap the fried fish at the bottom ,  a particular piece  .
 waste of bloody time ,  as if their lanjiao money sipeh big
 u first day on this island ?
 just a reflection of the community &apos;s values  .
 ignorant + selfish
 actually i have to admit i oso ask what is the item  .
 but oni at nasi padang stall cos the chup cover the meat until cannot tell lol
 its worse at mcd self service station .
 especially peak hours .
 macam gordan ramsey wannabe and design a gourmet burger out of a fillet o fish .
 people without their ezlink ready at mrt/bus or this is worse ?
 as the counter cashier ,  it presents the opportunity to sell more stuff .
 as the person queuing behind .
 not in a rush then anything ba .
 overseas in angmo countries ,  people actually make small chats with the counter staff .
 just ordering like what chiu mention is being portrayed as curt .
 i oso buay dahan customers customizing food to their preference and got so many request .
 eg noodle and char siew put seperate bowls , 
 hear so many complains ,  come due date everyone oso ll payup
 why we dont own hdb have to pay property tax .
 people in brunei are very happy with their lives under their beloved sultan .
 no worrying livelihood issues  .
 more jods than they can fill .
 population of 437k on 5765 sq km of land (8 x sinkieland) .
 1 billion barrels of oil in reserve
 this is not my cuntry .
 it’s a farking whore
 chiu never qualify cos chiu are foeign trash
 i’m sure other country loves you
 and singapore has tons of oil in macritchie .
 cos i’m always in the top 10% of income bracket .
 but why should i give a single cent to the other spectrum ?
 i work had and achieve it by myself .
 why penalize  me for my success .
 waseh that is alot sia
 ts if chiu vote for opposition ,  chiu think chiu dunnid to pay tax and gst ?
 how come i havent received mine ?
 oni extra $1 per month .
 your additional property tax can help the poor
 ah but we have a better resource .
 next to defence ,  .
 we are spending the most money to educate sinkies to beat the world .
 [to the extent that nus is the lumber 1 in the asia-pacific region] .
 oil can be exhausted .
 can be rendered irrelevant .
 indeed one of the major headaches for the sultan of brunei .
 their oil production is projected to run out by the year 2035 .
 not so far into the future .
 and dont get me started on go toilet now is  20 cents ,  increase of 100%
 divide by 365 days
 where &apos;s your location ?
 in singapore ,  occupied would be a detached about 5500sqft land size .
 mine is 3 landed at 1400sqm total .
 wa my hdb 5 rm increase $24 .
 given the talent in edmw and how they think they represent sinkies  ,  the people resource we have is worse than coal .
 wa 56 years old gilf .
 think if she naked in front of all straight male edmwers .
 didnt follow ,  but i didnt know that pagpag and balut were olympic sports .
 train hard than got loh boh train hard one than bo loh  , ts really knn die die wanna drag country in .
 why the hate sia .
 maybe it’s used as a proxy to the state of health of the country ?
 it must mean something otherwise nobody will go .
 yours looks edited ,  this is original .
 poor substitute for national honor .
 my biggest question is when will singapore get our 2nd gold medal
 i had a bad day today and this made me laugh !
 cos if get 2nd gold medal moi kukujiao will be chopped off  
 hot and sunny now
 rain at n east side lor .
 lets see the jinx
 dont bet on it .
 but passing shower oni .
 wow sibei song finally lain
 if rain continues heavy liddat limpeh will go jogging at 5pm leow .
 heavy rain wor~
 north here big big rain
 think afternoon start ,  with the gloomy weather and wind ,  atmosphere turn a bit cooling ,  if not cold liao .
 quite heavy in west area
 sibei strong wind
 later its the nepalese that come here with the mutants .
 if all of us start calling him unknown man ,  will he one day slip tongue and call himself that ?
 why do it yourself when others can do it for chiu .
 he oso know he is the unknown man .
 r the covid-free certs genuine ?
 u think he got come edmw ?
 maybe atb nick for travel bubble is tribute to edmw  i do a double take everytime i read news abt it
 why he &apos;s called unknown man ?
 we still want tharman to be pm
 think it &apos;s in the paper .
 or kim mentioned ?
 not very intelligent  .
 maybe parallel universe salty dragon better .
 i don’t think ts is saying that 3rd countries are 100% .
 i definitely didn’t .
 that’s not the point .
 the point is the likely 3rd countries will oso close off entry eventually .
 nothing to do with 3rd countries .
 it &apos;s the tokong logic behind this person of interest .
 high risk country (india) --> low risk countries (e .
 nepal ,  sir lanka) --> 14 days --> auto becomes lower risk profile .
 then might as well : high risk country (india) --> low risk countries (s &apos;pore) --> 21 days --> auto becomes even lower risk profile .
 problem is ,  this person of interest have forgotten that we have oredi banned all ceca long/short-term passholders/non-prs from india .
 hence ts is correct ,  is .
 looks like it &apos;s about time for: .
 as a matter of fact ,  i do think that they will  .
 this is now considered s’pore’s official stance on the matter .
 and since uae ,  bangladesh and maldives have oredi closed their doors ,  the swarm of locusts heading for nepal and sri lanka will rapidly grow in numbers ,  cos s’pore has officially stated that we are open to them if they come from such 3rd countries .
 it’s not an if ,  but a when ,  that these countries decide the 14-day tourists’ rupees is no longer worth the resulting taxing of their healthcare .
 chiu sound like one of those conspiracy theory guys
 rater the cotton decide to 1-up and straightaway ban based on nationality .
 cotton become the folk hero and win the favor of edmwers .
 cotton rise to the top and become charismatic leeder for 4g .
 the whole point is moot .
 depending on other countries to do the ban still requires singapore to ban india direct flights ,  so it &apos;s still banning india .
 i remember someone oso say cc oso sic sri lanka to someone so everyone will know about it so he is misunderstood to be a traitor .
 channel 8 news reported this loophole the next day too   .
 should be ts say one
 and the unknown man will remain unknown if he keeps driving along gongjiao way
 must congratulate this high iq move for helping to give a boost our slow covid numbers .
 how to self sufficient sia .
 deploy saf declare war on other fertile land country so we can have own agriculture and massive landspace ?
 for starters can acquire johor bahru alone ?
  can make use of the land ?
 tfr so low how to b self sufficient  
 we have more infrastructure compared to 1965 .
 i dont think its the equipment .
 i think is the user
 we all know the path fwd ,  but whether top mgmt oso see the same ,  got fire and ba !
 s to do so anot ?
 this kind of top mgmt kowtow to foreigners ,  dont expect anything good to come out  from them .
 feeling sad after reading the comments here  .
 feels like this small island rly no hope left liao 
 then migrate lor .
 chiu are too good for singapore .
 chiu should have left long ago 
 higher chance if chiu raise a scholar kid and insert into their ranks 
 what u mean wor 
 why clubbie chg mind wanna vax liao ?
 indeed it looks grim .
 we oni have human resources n we need measured n comprehensive policies to make it conducive for locals to feel they have a part in building spore for sporeans n future generations of sporeans n not just for spore core .
 if we rely too much on foreign imports like other uropean countries too concessionary social issues crops up like we c today .
 so what has our education system teething issues existing that cant meet the demands of our progress pace of economy that need other foreign talents to fill up ?
 how to self sufficient when we keep importing .
 ok where ts want to invade ?
 bintan ,  batam or johor ?
 upz for discussion 
 bro ,  self sufficiency as a policy died when goh keng swee left in 1985 .
 he was the oni one who dared to dream big .
 cannot say invade la say we t-loan
 should revive it  .
 the mgmt is wasting precious time and resources .
 please do not insult coal in this despicable manner .
 is it your annual value of home increased ?
 more than enough to cover many hand out
 bro its time for them to take back all the chicken wings plus interest
 u stay am house or u rent out sibo  ?
 last 2 years anyhow whack now we all have to pay back plus interest haha

 wa ,  i tell chiu ,  this is what witnessed at the ban mee stall and these requests were made by an auntie .
 i get more irritated when the cashier didn’t call me shuai ge .
 im more irritated by pg and mg  first time ordering fast food and dunno what to buy and how to buy .
 i like to irritate people and make people do the tsk tsk sound .
 i will then tsk tsk back to annoy them even more  .
 let us know how that works out for you
 some cashiers like to chit chat with customers .
 blah blah blah  .
 ice cream melting ,  can faster or not !
 yes ,  especially those see u walk towards the stall ,  they rush in front chiu ,  then start to check out the menu ,  thinking what to eat and ask many q .
 got 1 time ,  i can tell the counter oso buay song ,  i straight away shout to counter ,  fishsoup ,  1 yam rice ,  dabao .
 then counter reply ,  5 .
 same as those reach sgpools counter then still shading numbers

 sian of my iphone liao  .
 lai lai recommend new phone
 samsung fold z 2 .
 huawei p50 pro+
 any phone that can run harmonyos ,  is a solid phone .
 just lunched yesterday .
 super duper durable phone .
 fold 3 haben cum out
 brudder now is year 2021
 chiu ahtiong ib ah
 hence the emphasis on durable .
 cum out lai meh .
 no google store dey
 bigger better more satki than iphone
 are chiu cia asset ?
 harmonyos use their own appgallery .
 no need google playstore .
 iphone is da best .
 get remember mm color iphone la
 samsung fold 4 .
 huawei makes very good phones ,  but quite sad they were screwed by the usa .
 yes sir i agree as well… .
 at my current weight i don’t think it’s healthy in the long run
 for my case i never count calories .
 u still eat as per usual but each meal reduce 10-15% from your original portion .
 one problem with quick weight loss is most people balloon back very fast .
 i have a fren that did keto and while she came down fast she came back up fast once she stop .
 to me ,  i will recommend gradual weight loss if  u r not in a hurry lor .
 so far i’ve been able to maintain my weight for quite many yrs liow .
 one thing is once u reach your targetted weight u must give urself a range .
 for example if u put on a few kg then start controlling your food intake to bring down the weight first .
 once your weight balloons again u have to take a longer period to come down .
 thank chiu sis for your recommendation .
 i think following this gradual path is better ,  cos ballooning is bad and honestly rapid cutting is extremely bad as well
 u cut slowly your body can have time to adapt itself .
 so start by cutting a little .
 but please remember to check with doctor on the gym or exercise part due to your asthma condition .
 tell urself u can do it one !
 ts take heart …one day chiu will sing this song… .
 ”finally found the love of a lifetime… .
 this is getting ridiculous !
 ts ,  there is nothing wrong with your body .
 dont let naysayers here body shame chiu .
 chiu are what chiu are .
 if chiu want to lose weight for your health &apos;s sake ,  then go ahead .
 else ,  listen up .
 girls dont  judge your eligibility based solely on your external appearance .
 they are not shallow .
 ever heard of ladies that fancy dad bods over 6 packs .
 thats what chiu have .
 chiu listen to rubbish advice here ,  chiu get rubbish results .
 now u know lor can add that to your list of cantonese swear words  
 yeah but i look at the picture i think he very fit wor
 thank chiu bro…  but honestly i am far from fit  just that my chest is very broad haha
 i can try masquerading as a fcp if thats your lane 
 do correct me if i am wrong .
 i think girls generally prefer a guy that they can feel secure and somewhat must be emotionally strong .
 i think that is something that quite a number of girls out there actually look for .
 sorry to hear about that .
 understand where chiu are coming from on trust
 dude i think if chiu slim+bulk up chiu will legit have good physique ,  got the v shape .
 thank chiu sir  i will work on it
 as long as u r safe when exercising .
 take care and hope u achieve your ideal weight soon .
 remember no pain no gain 
 i thought chiu are going to beijing to jiak hong and study master ?
 im a security guard .
 but still single  .
 it doesnt matter to me anyways as a single cos im still enjoying my life .
 chiu will never see me open emo threads or talk about sadness being lonely .
 i am planning where to go for nice dinner on salary day .
 but im still happy 
 without trust there cannot be relationships .
 well different people have different ways of coping ,  i choose to try and trust again .
 moi fwend ask one .
 should just stick to the  &apos;no jump queue &apos; excuse .
 this clown is just full of sh !
 always want to be special .
 might as well ask to jab his kkb .
 maybe want the nurse give special
 more cleber than pinky .
 put tank in his mall la
 no wonder he is pinoy president
 jab on his head better
 this dodirty always dodirty one .
 jab it right into the anus
 this idiot is full of shit .
 joke of a president .
 ahaha sick pinoy
 don’t want to take just say don’t want to take lor .
 i thought he damn satki one ?
 what a gheyish reason
 scarli is no jab since cant let people see .
 chances of winning all 6 numbers is 1 in 14million .
 just input all the past 14 million draws result into computer and filter out the unopened combination ?
 i use data analytics to predict toto numbers .
 not 100% accurate per se .
 5m winnings per month .
 now i lost count of my winnings and i need to engage a financial planner to keep track .
 that is possible oni if .
 1) the draw numbers are not truly random .
 2) the reason of the numbers not being truly random is notch due to  &apos;special &apos; intervention .
 yup ,  it will generate 14 million possible combi that might open ,  then chiu just choose one
 tia sexpert gong ,  actually is possible .
 probability does not change no matter whether the number open before or not though 
 my friend use 45 piece small paper ,  a box ,  and a pen .
 he analyze the number by picking them using his hands and self study the number .
 for 5 years he won around few hundred thousand .
 after that he stop analysing anymore as he told me the time spent analysing is not worth it .
 very long hours he said .
 opened before can still open again leh ,  no point to filter
 u can come up with algo to compute patterns but to strike 1st/2nd prize not quite possible .
 but striking those smaller prizes got good chance  
 can can i sell chiu software for 500k can liao .
 i can help chiu keep track for 80k per month .
 chiu will need their maintenance schedule if chiu wanna increase your prediction chances .
 can can i even use ai to predict toto
 if chiu can predict the numbers ,  then toto is fraud liao .
 i give u better idea .
 toto is done live using a machine .
 take video of it .
 calculate the angle and velocity and see if got any patterns .
 can use quantum random number generators online .
 mostly from research labs .
 this is why chiu study probabilities in school .
 read up on gambler &apos;s fallacy .
 use quick pick .
 calculated by computer haha
 wa jin jelly your power of imagination

 switzerland ,  a land locked nation with little natural resources are able to identify their niche and build their local core instead of mass immigration .

 then jab backsai with vaccine means backsai will be sore ?
 tiagong they using sinovac 
 shaft one cucumber up his anal canal la .
 23yo still young leh .
 lower your expectations .
 chiu might think they are oredi low but remember ,  there is always room to go lower
 tbh ,  if chu so good ,  lub will come to chu .
 dontch need put in much effort to craft churself into some alpha chad .
 feelings are illogical .
 either they like chu or they dontch .
 chu just do chur own thing .
 when u are older ,  u will know love is a lie .
 so yes enjoy while u are young .
 but please dont die for love .
 the oni love is self love  
 start working out and your problems will be solved
 quoted for truth ,  chiu can always get a date if chiu lower your expectations ,  but your real problem is not cos chiu cant get a date ,  but rather chiu cant get a  &apos;worthy &apos; date
 the more chiu work on yourself ,  the higher your chance of getting someone chiu want .
 if chiu work out daily and become fit and strong ,  girls who like fit and strong guys will like chiu better .
 and even if chiu dont get a girl ,  in the meantime ,  hey ,  it &apos;s good to be fit and strong .
 chu applied logic to feelings which are illogical .
 chu dontch rationalize feelings ,  attraction cannot be negotiated .
 chu do chur own thing ,  work on churself for churself ,  on chur own terms .
 not for zhabors ,  not to impress and attract them .
 who cares chu get zhabors or not ?
 why is it even a consideration ?
 what chiu say is true .
 attraction cannot be negotiated .
 and chiu should work on yourself for yourself .
 but if chiu want to get hitched and chiu cannot get the quality of girl chiu want ,  then chiu need to work on yourself .
 women date up .
 it &apos;s just how it is .
 chiu need to have something to bring to the table .
 what to work will depend on chiu and what chiu want (social skills ,  marketable skills ,  physique ,  etc .
 ) ,  and your mileage will vary .
 the alternative is to rely on luck .
 sure chiu might get lucky ,  and luck always plays a part ,  but why not tilt the odds in your favour ?
 rather than lowering your expectations ,  why not work on yourself ?
 be a better man .
 again chu applied logic .
 hardwork and result for something as illogical and fickle as feelings is not linear .
 massive hardwork will notch get chu a zhabor .
 chu are wasting time pursuing this nonsense that may not yield any results .
 zhabors are besides the point .
 the result is chur own life .
 alot of those who married want their life back as a single .
 i’m a 33yo single male .
 last relationship oredi at least 5 years back .
 i oso think i can get ready to be single rest of my life .
 there &apos;s oni so much chiu can change about yourself without resorting to plastic surgery .
 wtf like a ogre giant no wonder all girls scared away
 best case scenario .
 bbfa is the best !
 im not going to argue with anyone who wants to improve himself .
 i think it will improve your chances with women ,  chiu dont .
 either way ,  you &apos;ll find out .
 anyway my message isnt for chiu .
 it &apos;s for all the guys complaining they are stuck with the dinobus and why do the 6/10s and above hiam them .
 why do chiu suggest they do ,  resign themselves to fate ?
 they should and by all means improve themselves ,  but they should oso have realistic expectations of the quality of dates they expect even after their self-improvement .
 chiu can improve your sense of humor ,  but you &apos;ll never be as funny as a stand-up comedian ,  chiu can improve your figure ,  but you &apos;re unlikely to be ripped as a bodybuilder ,  chiu can improve your looks ,  but chiu wont &apos; look like a kpop star .
 tldr: they shouldn &apos;t improve themselves for the sole sake of getting quality dates .
 does anybody knows how to transfer data from android to iphone ?
 or i hammer chiu then chiu know !
 by crossing one of his opponent out in the voting slip .
 f**k chiu and your mom and your sister and your job  .
 and your broke-ass car and that sh1t chiu call art .
 f**k chiu and your friends that i &apos;ll never see again .
 everybody but your dog ,  chiu can all f**k off
  &apos;fack off ,  please .

 usually i ask them so when &apos;s your next jab ?
 prease leave moi alone tyvm
 if people look at us ,  they can see two people .
 1 hard at work ,  and the other with nothing better to do .
 what do chiu think ?
  &apos;your existence is purely redundant at this very location ,  thank chiu .
 we would like to discuss in private .
 cos we are so ceca-fied .
 just say im busy right now .
 i will get back to chiu .
 or not interest in your offer .
 hr r gd in this actually .
 u can learn from them .
 must add please
 moi agree ,  we should really start to make forays into a self-sufficient singapore .
 unfortunately ,  they still believe in open door concept
 households should be allowed to breed poultry for self consumption (meat ,  egg)
 very few nation can do this .
 no leh i think chiu guys forgot cleopatra or egypt woman is jinx &apos;s bff saw phiak hwa and not the jinx   .
 remember the photo of how saw treated herself like an egyptian when she was the smrt ceo ?
 i was just searching elizabeth taylor cleopatra last night
 who the fark is that ?
 done nicely leh .
 sound on for the feels .
 they oredi put in many restrictions to detect porn so bbfa dont abuse it
 omg jin ho chio  .
 he look like one hong kong actor .
 am i the oni one extremly pissed off with ninjavan delivery services ?
 very very slow and lousy .
 companies engaging ninjavan ,  prepare to get your hard-earned reputation condemned .
 i ordered so many items online .
 oni ninjavan cannot make it at all .
 even my overseas items have arrived one by one .
 yet local items under ninjavan ,  all sleeping in ninja warehouse for weeks .
 its not that it sucks la .
 this is what era ?
 chiu comparing pre-covid era with now ?
 i ask them drop off at ninja point .
 cos near my house n they wont delay if ninja point .
 mine write sending to their sorting hub since 4 days ago knn what is the driver doing with my stuff .
 my item suppose to arrive yesterday .
  still now seems like ninja can even go collect my parcel from the compang
 mine still sitting in ninja vzn 5 days after collection
 during cb or what ?
 if it &apos;s during cb then everything sucks ,  j&t express delay like crazy oso .
 not valid now cos all the ninja points are non-essential shops which r all closed .
 think myabe driver problem
 comparing during covid .
 all ordered about same time .
 oni ninjavan items all stuck in warehouse everyday not moving at all .
 yea ninjavan is rather slow at picking up and delivery
 atleast urs in some warehouse mine in van .
 dont use ninja point especially if it &apos;s those lockers ,  they &apos;ll  &apos;fail &apos; to deliver if there &apos;s technical issue or if the lockers are full .
 anyway ninja van has one of the worst standards i &apos;ve encountered for a local courier .
 avoid if possible
 disgusting from them .
 nowdays simple item oso take 1 week
 they claimed to be the best .
 allowing the lowest bidder to get the job to do the bulk of delivery ,  and for them to not do a good job is the same as cheating customer .
 customer buys cos of the promoted low price ,  but does it mean they have to accept the low grade delivery job as well ?
 continue the vicious cycle ,  blame customer for buying cheap
 so far ,  still efficient and timely for me
 i oso think so .
 strike the iron while its hot
 the eswari girl pretty leh .
 can jack neo stop this simi lanjiao ah boys to men army nonsense ?

 it’s the effort needed to get the begree from fthe mill that counts 
 fake degree is when chiu print out your own havard master  from your canon pixma at home knowing well your highest qualification is moulmein high .
 so anything below that is acceptable .
 like imda nisha ?

 all they need is to spend 20k rupees whilst most of u spend 20k sgd .
 pap really needs a waking up call .

 does australia accept degree mills for migration ?
 even stat board like ida takes in nisha with degree mill .
 but sgrean with fch cant get in
 the entire education system is a scam .
 no point wasting your time in school unless chiu are getting a professional degree like medicine ,  engineering etc .
 everything else chiu can find on the internet
 this is really amazing .
 sinkies got so much  against them .
 ns ,  proper hard work in a sinkie u and now this .
 degree mill is when chiu pay $20 to get a cert from an online university .
 and mom allows them to enter singapore to steal our jobs .
 come on la ,  degree no need study can get ,  experience cannot make up ?
 yep remember the spu saga ?
 even got fake medical degrees
 yeap and both are bad .
 defeats the whole basis of education .
 on other hand employers got to be smarter too but wait employers are them too .

 question themselves why they are doing what they do .
 chu go a big round do self improvement for zhabor validation ,  why ?
 what is the standard chu hold churself to ?
 chur own or some unknown random zhabor ?
 zhabors are illogical and fickle ,  one moment this next moment something else .
 what sort of standard is set for moving goal post ?
 is there even meaning to it ?
 running a hamster wheel ,  a dog chasing own tail ,  what result is achieved ?
 when u go outside industry and work .
 there are plenty of women for u to date .
 introspection certainly beats self improvement for the sake of getting women .
 all those gentlemen complaining about the lack of women should certainly question themselves about what they want in life .
 it &apos;s true ,  self improvement can oni take chiu so far .
 but who knows where the road will end !
 and before chiu know it ,  chiu are funnier and have a better physique .
 maybe not as funny as a stand up comedian or as ripped as a bodybuilder ,  but not bad at all .
 have read both lines of perspectives .
 i definitely agree with bzzbzz view on self-improvement .
 it &apos;s better than not doing anything and staying at a null position .
 but at the same time ,  i oso agree with sayporkguy that what chiu work for ,  might not necessarily guarantee chiu a waifu .
 the most important thing is focus on self-improvement for yourself ,  plan for a life of luxury for yourself .
 and when someone happens to come along ,  then can adjust expectations accordingly .
 in the pursuit of self-improvement ,  some might realise they &apos;re better off being single cos they are comfortable with it .
 that ,  i will say it &apos;s not wrong as well .
 at least chiu went further than what chiu could have achieve from the past .
 one thing is for sure ,  is that it is extremely important to be self-sufficient regardless whether single or not .
 i guess it &apos;s when i see guys like evilsun talking about how hopeless life is as a short guy .
 or ts saying he wont find love in this lifetime .
 give yourself a chance .
 doesnt matter whether chiu do it for yourself or for a girl or whatever ,  but do something .
 fight for yourself .
 no one else is gonna do it for chiu .
 besides ,  what are chiu gonna spend your time doing ?
 everything humans feel is an evolutionary product of our survival instincts .
 if a woman feels  &apos;love &apos; it is cos it comes from her natural and innate fear and insecurity ,  driving her to take action for her survival in the natural world .
 it is not magic or divine .
 it does not guarantee success or happiness in this unnatural modern world .
 if we can realise this about all our feelings ,  then we wont be like slaves ,  blindly led or driven by them .
 with his muscular build and tall stature ,  takeo gouda is not exactly your average high school freshman .
 however ,  behind his intimidating appearance hides a heart of gold ,  and he is considered a hero by the boys for his courage and chivalry .
 unfortunately ,  these traits do not help much with his .
 self improvement doesn’t need validation la .
 if she can’t appreciate u just move on until finding one appreciate u lo
 chu see churself improving is oredi self validating .
 that is the whole point .
 chu validate churself ,  not for someone else .
 they are irrelevant to chu improving .
 i dont really blame the women as shallow  ,  in fact in my own honest opinion  ,  i think that women should really stay away from short men as well which is the logical and beneficial thing to do  ,  not trying to be sarcastic but a matter of fact oso .
 the undeniably fact that taller men are much attractive  ,  provide more sense of security plus the fact that there is a higher percentage of a taller offspring if in the case that they do decided to breed .
 it is better for the whole of society least they do not breed the next generation of bitter short men .
  honestly if im a gcp  ,  i definitely wouldnt go for any men that is under 1 .
 75m  ,  an ideal men would be 1 .
 but at the same time  ,  i dont play into the hypocritical theory that one should wait for their  &apos;fate &apos; to come  ,  such mutual fate oni happened provided that chiu are of average or of above average standard .
 rather than feeding short guy the  &apos;blue pill &apos; and misleading them into a  &apos;beautiful prison &apos; telling them that it is all about improving yourself and  &apos;fate &apos; will come  ,  why not be upfront and honest with them with the  &apos;red pill &apos; of the cold hard fact that they certainly lack the physical attributes to be consider average and will probably be hard to find someone in the dating pool .
 rather than wasting all their time ,  effort  ,  youth and energy into pursuing a path that it is not meant to be ,   perhaps they can consider going for fl services to fill up any empty gaps or lust that they have than to pursue a relationship which is not cater for them in this lifetime .
 there is of course pros and cons to each and every path taken .
 huh does that means chiu want to stay stagnant for life ?
 mly just pointed out that he is <1 .
 7 and women throw themselves at him .
 so whatever chiu are saying about short guys is just not particularly true .
 sure ,  being shorter is a disadvantage ,  but it is by no means the disadvantage chiu make it out to be .
 the real question is ,  why wont chiu give yourself a chance ?
 if really desperate nothing wrong with getting plastic surgery oso .
 chu mean just cos chu dontch know what imma improving on means imma stagnant ?
 i am happy for chiu sis .
 hope chiu can find happiness with your partner 
 dont say till like this leh .
 let &apos;s just say i ,  like many others ,  do not have problems finding a female companion .
 i can see why women pass chiu .
 it has nothing to do with your height .
 i can oni offer chiu counsel based on what i observe .
 what chiu do with it ,  its your choice .
 i wish chiu well .
 hope chiu find happiness in your choice .
 i disagree with your view to agree with sayporkguy lol .
 what he &apos;s saying in a nutshell is it is alright to be obnoxious .
 people improve themselves for themselves .
 getting a female companion is a by-product .
 and if a lady sees chiu working hard to better yourself ,  it tells of your character and the future she has when she picks chiu .
 i have known of two case studies of friends who have gotten attached .
 one of the guys was below 1 .
 7 ,  extremely confident ,  good in studies ,  top few in cohort and had a clear path ahead of him .
 he did not end up with a sinkie gal and chose to go for vietnamese gal instead .
 but granted the gal was attractive and well educated too .
 another guy ,  not as well educated ,  probably 1 .
 7m on the dot ,  settled for a sinkie gal that would in most circumstances ,  be judged as below average in edmw .
 she is not a dino bu but not eye appealing either .
 if i am not wrong ,  he managed his expectations well ,  since the gal was not a uni grad too .
 so ,  in some circumstances ,  chiu can salvage but got to play to strengths
 it &apos;s quite a regularly used phrase after a hong kong serial movie in the 90s iirc .
 not sure the story behind it ,  but according to hker friends ,  it &apos;s more towards  &apos;go and die &apos; ,  or  &apos;go to h3ll &apos; .
 as in many hong kong phrases ,  it always sound nice on the outside ,  but packed with lots of sharp bones inside .
 what &apos;s the context(ie situation) ?
 can i have a moment please ?
 farking fark off larrrr knn cibai
 why must they f off .
 why u cannot move away
 did u see the tree there ?
 run and touch then go home ,  chiu have 10 seconds to do so .
 your time starts now !
 just tell that someone politely
 depends on situation and medium of communication 
 you: please sir ,  may i have some more please ?
 them: some more what ?
 you: peace and quiet
 the last one is indeed politely .
 first 3 are rude la .
 crazy : “hello !
 me : “please pardon me ,  chiu are excused .
 use  &apos;please &apos; in front of the sentence .
  followed by  &apos;thank you &apos;
 scuse me ,  your presence before me is unwarranted .
 i usually am not polite to others .
 if i pretend to be polite when scolding others ,  that is being pretentious ,  something i hate when other people are like that
 i said good day !
 silent treatment is the best .
 no need to waste time on rude people
 can u get out of my elite uncaring face ?

 it &apos;s the delivery man problem in your area .
 my area so far good experience ,  100% delivery rate .
 please be patient ,  due to overwhelming logistic demand ,  many courier companies are employing jobless folks who lost their jobs due to covid ,  many of new delivery folks had limited training and experience .
 due to delays ,  even our grab and foodpanda delivery men had their fuse blown ,  let off steam and kena 9696 by our ruthless keyboard warriors of social media ,  they lost their jobs .
 like many wfh people ,  efficiency drop 30-40% as claimed by some hr research .
 logistic companies and staff had their limitation resulting delays .
 their hotline and chatline useless one .
 this one i agree
 hr do what one ah ?
 wa ,  lost 100 over parcels is terrible !
 so far my experience with ninja van is ok .
 there wasn &apos;t any lost parcels .
 could be the guy/team in charge of your area ?
 i &apos;ve been getting my deliveries from lazada via ninja van ,  so far ok .
 or maybe never overload so prioritize bigger platforms and customers first .
 ninjavan really slow
 please gibe chance la during this cb period .
 ninjavan delivery guy oso human ,  they have family at home like chiu and me .
 they need to put food on the table too .
 please dont break their rice bowl .
 chiu working from home right  ?
 no go anywhere right  ?
 what &apos;s wrong for waiting a little bit fellow sinkie  ?
 hw cums chius all so many problems ?
 heng mois noes issues 
 i guess it is up to individual luck and the assigned delivery persons .
 i have ordered 2 times on lazada the week before and both orders were delivered on labour day and yesterday by ninjavan .
 if i order online and can choose my delivery vendor ,  obviously i will not choose ninjavan .
 now no choice then how ,  suck thumb lor .
 so many delivery companies out there ,  ninjavan is the worst !
 but they always do pr stunts to get into newspaper articles .
 but core business of delivery ,  lousy like #%@^#& .
 luckily other deliveries do their core business properly
 i got 2 orders ,  created 27/04 and 30/04 ,  both item still with seller i assume cause they havent pick up .
 sellers oso cannot use other courier cos freaking lazada dont allow .
 qoo10 most reliable .

 once u scan the token it will show
 oh ,  the physical token can differentiate ?
 never seen before so no idea .
 currently when go eat at mall ,  using the tt app .
 ah pek later cannot go in even though they vaccinated .
 cos they no smart phone .
 yes once u scan the token the person checking can see your vaxx status ,  thats how elderly able to eat in restaurants and food court with token
 should be the same ,  use tt app to show .
 but so far 99% screeners dont bother to tap  &apos;refresh &apos; .
 didnt they give a paper vaccination card when go for jab
 i believe the physical token cannot be used anymore to check in .
 it doesnt show vaccination status .
 bye bye millions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money lol
 their screen will show when chiu tap the token .
 suggest maybe a hangover badge for them  ?
 most people will have throw the paper away since nobody told them is important documents .
 spu master (degree mill cert) in submission during hiring but imda says its not consider fraud cos they hire her based on experience .

 gahment agency come out with such response
 what do chiu expect from people who wants shortcut for everything ?
 need football player ?
 need table tennis player ?
 need population growth ?
 my bro got uncredited degree from ireland cannot find job leh
 mom playing around with words and technicality
 what &apos;s the difference between unaccredited degree and taking private uni in singapore ?
 very sad that we have come to this stage .
 our education system failed very badly and we producing useless graduates .
 even mill certs from foreign countries more employable than locals with real certs .
 need a change of gahment .
 are they going to backlog all the s-pass and convert the majority to 5k+++ salary work pass ?
 tks to ramesh and uptron now sinkies can go getch 1 too  !
 just that the place issuing the degree not accredited .
 chiu have less problems than most 
 ownself validate ownself ?
 this version ,  i approve 
 nope i don’t agree with being obnoxious to girls .
 but i believe that for some ,  it is better off being single even with self improvement .
 chiu consider the perspective that chiu work really hard and found some success ,  then girls take attention suddenly .
 this was definitely the case for my doctor uncle .
 he bought his own house (not hdb) at 35 and finally had some free time for dating scene .
 he went to find a gal or rather gals were attracted to him before he started searching .
 some people aren’t comfortable with dating ,  cos either then their expectations would be higher (extends to both guys and girls) or they feel extremely comfortable being single .
 so ,  there is nothing wrong with choosing the single option .
 what i feel is wrong ,  is not improving yourself and blaming situations for your life ,  downward spiralling to depression .
 in that situation ,  better to seek mental support .
 regardless of whatever option chiu choose in life ,  chiu do not want to be in a position to compromise your sanity .
 chu dontch comprehend meaning of self improvement ah ,  bruh ?
 chu 20 yrs outdated le ,  old man .
 im a female ,  and i dont think short guys are undesirable i mentioned many times in this forum ,  so many ssfa dont believe me .
 even until mly entered the chat ,  still ssfa dont believe .
 short guys are cute ,  easy to kiss ,  and compact in size ,  can gaze into their eyes without craning my neck ,  short guys have many advantages .
 im oni 158cm ,  160cm male is acceptable .
 yes  ,  maybe the purple pill is what bbfa/ssfa can venture into .
 to add on  ,  of course im not saying that one should wallow in self pity just cos they got no market in the dating scene but rather to come to term and realization with it and move on to focus on something else  ,  maybe one will be much happier with life .
 i do agree that being optimistic is good but too much of fake optimism isnt good for one  ,  clearly there is something lacking thus one isnt chosen  ,  where times and times again where reality doesnt match with expectations  ,  one become frustrated  ,  jaded and cynical .
 yet again there will be bbfa/ssfa outliers who can manage to excel and beat the  &apos;dating game &apos; but what is the probability unless one is exceptional good/rich where most bbfa/ssfa are just normal average working salary man without much extraordinary talent or skillset .
 the saying that  &apos;there is someone out there for everyone &apos; isnt really true  ,  there will certainly be a pool of undesirable population out there in this world who will just be single for their entire life due to circumstances by either choice or by force .
 if one happen to fall into such undesirable pool  ,  there isnt much choice but to accept and come to term with it .
 there is pros and cons in every decision  ,  of course  ,  the undesirable one may miss out the experience of dating  ,  marriage  ,  etc but at the same time probably will avoid the trap of betrayal  ,  women charter law  ,  etc .
 same goes for chionging as well which is meant to fulfill basic human need and lust  ,  the moment of pleasure might lead to life time emptiness as well .
 if life is a game of cards  ,  one can oni play with the deck of cards that is assigned to chiu and in the game of  &apos;big 2 &apos;  ,  i know that my cards well that im oni assigned the lower tier card number while other player out there have the higher tier card which make it hard for me to stand out or beat the game .
 not saying that it is impossible but chances is low and im know i dont have what it take to win .
 honestly i find it hard to believe especially cause studies/research/data/media have shown that majority would still prefer the taller male which to be honest is the logical sense to do so cause simply taller guy are just more attractive  ,  no doubt about it .
 it is individual preferences as well  ,  nothing wrong with going for taller male .
 like i say  ,  if im a gcp  ,  i would definitely oni accept male that is >=1 .
 maybe chiu just want to appear less shallow/superficial or that chiu perhaps to put in some form of encouragement to encourage positivity within the community .
 either way it is fine .
 on a side note  ,  majority of 1 .
 58m female would always end up with 1 .
 it is actually the perfect match in term of couple appearance and height differences  ,  my honest opinion to chiu oso is that dont go for short guy simply cos of 3 reason .
 1) they are shorter thus lesser confidence and lesser sense of security .
 2) always mindful of their short height    .
 3) genes issues
 i disagree lor .
 6m and i wont want a guy taller than 1 .
 75m is prob too tall .
 cos it will mean i have to strain my neck to even talk to him .
 see so difficult right ?
 the girl looks like his daughter in terms of height  
 aside from your shortness ,  whatever your height is ,  dont chiu have any saving grace ?
 decent looks ,  ok career ,  reasonable intelligence ,  passable physique ,  interesting hobbies ?
 have chiu actually tried to get to know ,  or have friends of the opposite gender ?
 my view on the other pills before i discuss: .
 blue pill - it doesnt work cos one will end up depressed when there &apos;s no girl in their life .
 loneliness will set in when they not attached .
 reality is often far from perfect and it doesnt help to over-value a girl and think that by doing so ,  it will help one to get the girl .
 red pill - justifiable for those who have a bad romance experience previously or dont intend to settle down and oni into casual dating .
 i dont see any issue with these people .
 not choosing to associate with girls for marriage ,  i think thats alright in the given situation .
 black pill - justifiable for those with disadvantaged height (<1 .
 6m)  ,  family background ,  etc .
 though i feel majority would not have to belong to this group .
 purple pill - is a good balance point between singlehood and marriage .
 key is work on yourself for yourself .
 if chiu single ,  chiu have all the luxury to yourself to enjoy life .
 if in marriage ,  then chiu can have kids or have a companion to share emotional woes with .
 fake optimism isnt good ,  there will come a point of time where reality sets in .
 neither do i agree that it is ok to be cynical .
 for me ,  probability isnt a centrepiece of my focus ,  as much as statistics can offer some form of comfort ,  it oso gives pressure .
 i just give my best and put career as my main focus ,  i dont like to let statistics define my position in life .
 priority is to have more than enough to feed myself .
 that being said ,  not everyone is meant to be attached and marry ,  but most are .
 if chiu talk about happy marriage ,  then that is a different topic for another day .
 this undesirable population probably belong into the black pill category ,  which isnt alot .
 of all my single guy friends irl ,  none i know are black pill .
 a few are red ,  handful are purple .
 even if undesirable ,  one could find foreign spouse or classically buy wife .
 that will not be black pill anymore .
 definitely ,  there &apos;s always pros/cons to weigh it out .
 no right or wrong answer i feel cos romance is subjective .
 chiu and i will view pros/cons differently and take different routes in life .
 as for the cards analogy ,  it depends on your present situation and how much you &apos;re able to salvage .
 some people for instance came to realisation at 18 that they have to buck up and work extremely hard ,  while others came to the realisation at 30 .
 the former obviously has better potential to succeed in life .
 however ,  that is their life ,  i live my own life according to what i have .
 one definite thing: chiu cant pressure someone to like chiu ,  so best to live life in your own terms and conditions .
 sad to say you &apos;re perhaps the minority
 i used to think like chiu ,  i never find love for 33 years of my life .
 until one day when i travel europe .
 i met her in the tour group .
 and thats how everything started for me .
 sometimes its just happen in the least unexpected place .
 i went to europe with my mum ,  bringing her to see the world  .
 end up i find love there .
 found her ,  had a good chemistry with her ,  able to chat n laugh ,  and there where we started eye sparking one another .
 came back singapore ,  met and date for a few times .
 and we became official gf and bf after 3months .
 and its has been 2 years oredi  .
 planning to get marry around end 2023 .
 and planning to propose to her next year  .
 i used to be bbfa oso  .
 everyday go work ,  after work ,  go home pak game ,  thats kinda lonely life .
 when your destine one is near u ,  u will know it .
 multiple gerls over at cmb thread has ranked looks as their most impt trait in a guy compared to other traits  .
 of course this is not across the board for all gerls ,  but one thing &apos;s for sure: guys must at least look presentable .
 and not being overweight is part of being presentable
 using cmb thread as your source of data is like using ask girls in a soccer club for their opinions of guys .
 there are few girls in one and if they exist ,  are spoilt for choice .
 i figured this at 19 y .
 i was offered engineering .
 i wondered how was i ever going to meet girls .
 i switched to economics .
 surely chiu cant be this  .
 actually ,  chiu are the minority .
 a few ladies have oredi given chiu their views that height is not the deal breaker .
 im using ninja van ,  can chiu share with me what other platform is good/better ?
 definitely not signpost as it &apos;s worse imo .
 never is bigger ,  they do take up responsibility when parcels gone missing .
 if chiu need more than $100 coverage ,  buy more insurance for individual parcel .
 other smaller couriers ok mah ?
 will deliver promptly ,  will pay up when parcels missing ?
 i know singpost compensate me $0 for a few parcel lost .
 to be honest my parcels lately processed way faster than never .
 once it reach our shores ,  2-3 days later will pop up at mailbox
 im sending from singapore within singapore ,  not from oversea so their operation is different .
 imagine picking up all parcels from 1 location instead of xxxx locations in singapore .
 their ops should be easier in this way .
 my parcels sent to buyer seems ok during this cb period .
 from buyers feedback normally 1-3 days .
 never on the other hand more than a week from merchant with no whereabouts of exact parcel location .
 finally status updated that reach warehouse at 4+ today .
 hopefully tomorrow will deliver
 mine wait a long time before reach warehouse .
 wait almost a week ,  send to another warehouse .
 then continue waiting .
 what the heck they doing ,  i have no idea .
 ya i think so too
 never received thing from them before
 i chose their contactless delivery .
 the guy just left my parcel outside door .
 until after some time i received email then know my item come liao .
 kukujiao put outside so long .
 mine went ninja warehouse sorting for 4 times oredi .
 the ninja fellows playing a fool is it ?
 going eat air round the island 
 the longest i wait for ninjavan is one week .
 i still like qxpress they deliver my items by the way 2-5days .
 but all these companies still better than singpost/speedpost .
 so far no issue with them ,   for now sure have delay due to the cb .
 least yours went 4 times .
 mine a week liao still not even a single time go warehouse .
 both my orders still with seller ,  i think it &apos;s safer that ninja havent collected .
 higher risk of lost parcel if they touch i guess .
 i contacted lazada ,  ask them to help me arrange alternatives ,  promised to call back in 24hrs .
 relak a bit la .
 their business so good ,  but manpower is limited .
 mti is giving a fix limited on number of employees working ,  so they cannot hire more even if they want to .
 other couriers ,  if still sending well ,  probably means their business not as good .
 once any courier has a bigger amount of deliveries to be done ,  sure go hey wire .
 will or not just curious .
 scare little bro attack -1 if smoke too much .

 yah agree ,  i oredi moved on and focus on learning new skills for my work liao .
 if u cant beat the game ,  chiu can dont play the game what .
 no one force u to play the game
 first qn  ,  of course is zumba .
 mlbb oni have bbfa ,  gym oni got ghey ,  fishing club got uncles .
 second qn ,  d lor .
 third qn ,  should be 3 .
 elimination method lor .
 edmw confirm strike out .
 sbf all guys there so strike out .
 mycarforum got gals meh
 the 3rd qn of course is baking class .
 even go any class is better than use dating apps .
 was in the cmb thread hearing people complain for ages  .
 the cmb thread climb until dunno part xx liao
 the most important love u need to find in this life is the love for yourself !
 i will choose dd1 .
 d cos i love adventure and nature .
 of course after fishing need to put back into sea  .
 this is what i am more interested in than the rest .
 the next d is cos i read the forum before ,  nothing much just more females inside  .
 matter of the heart category last time can see girls asking how to find .
 lastly 1 ,  cos people are more serious there although chances of match may be little .
 i do not like baking that much as i do not have the time or interest to do it every week or month .
 this question is designed for scholars .
 must think out of box .
 many single ladies go there investigate .
 got single moms too .
 bbfa cant compete in primary market ,  can try secondary market 
 wow your gf how old ?
 during the tour how u strike up the conversation with her ?
 so did i got all qn right ?
 uncle eyesight bad haha
 eh baking class wrong meh .
 then dating apps meh .
 but i always hear those people in the cmb thread complain
 personally i feel for the black pill guys cos i am close to this type of people and oso single .
 see affinity if have then good for that person  ,  if not other alternative should not be discouraged if it makes one happy  .
 know is one thing .
 but uncle too old to play the dating game .
 rather stay at home play fapping game instead lol
 same tour group  .
 inside the same bus for 14 days  .
 so her family love asking me to help them take pictures .
 and i kind of become like a photographer in the whole tour group  .
 the very first time she talk was when i was standing behind her in rome petrol kiosk cashier ,  there is 2 suspicious man standing behind me eyein on my backpack ,  she told me to be careful and stuff n help me to keep look out .
 then after that the following days its pretty much chit chat ,  taking photo ,  eat together in the same table .
 and then eventually led to eye sparking ,  then during our last day in paris ,  we took photo together in lourve paris and i buy her macarons n stuff ,  my mum was with us all the way  .
 so eventuall y come back to singapore liao ,  she text me few days later to meet out for dinner ,  so we had our first date at suntec n had ramen nagi .
 and the story goes on from there .
 oh yah ,  she did throw a coin into trevi fountain and wishes herself to get a bf n settle down soon cos she is not young liao  ,  30 years old ,  and her wish came true  .
 she is 32 this year liao ,  and i am 35 .
 wow didnt know tour group oso can like that
 never really keep to date of the laws here :/
 it was later reported that the actor &apos;s surname is chan .
  xiasuay max man !
 so is          who
 time to go study in schools with mill certs .
  where can join ?
 this is an absolute disgrace to singapore .
 go taobao buy lor .
 can ask to laminate oso .
 this is the cecapura chiu voted for
 so mom take into account experience oso lol .
 result of 60% election victory and no accountability gahment .
 leemember this and do the needful when the time comes .
 experience can oso be fakes
 mom is a loose pus$$y
 fake degree is ownself print .
 degree mill is people print fake degree for u .
 see the difference ?
 forged and degree mill isnt it same ?
 forged is buy from people who printed it for chiu .
 degree mill is just a bit high class and package nicer ,  no lic and people print from you
 civil service should show example and give scholarship to students undertaking degree mills ,  after that giving them high paying jobs .
 ceca degree get pmet jobs .
 private uni do grab .
 should be degree mill is a subset of fake degree .
 fake degree covers everything ,  regardless who prints it .
 lai chut stunt liao .
 more cxxa coming
 of cos satki uptron diploma can work as jp morgan satki title .
 pap even after so many nonsense still doing the same thing .
 old pic/news but still nonsense
 yes ,  they totally cannot make it ,  another one is their direct competitor ,  simi wolf one .
 in fact ,  i stopped using lazada cos majority of the sellers there are using either of these 2 courier services ,  and chiu have no option to pay a higher courier premium to secure a better delivery service with them .
 10 times i purchased lazada things ,  10 times i get their excuse that cannot make the delivery ,  and i have to reschedule .
 the last 2 times ,  i sent in my complaints and email records for them ,  and stopped using lazada altogether ,  except for redmart .
 one of the complaints ,  i dangled a 50 dollar bait just for them to make delivery ,  and they took it .
 i honored the reward .
 but that was my last time using them .
 it was enough proof there was no incentive for them to make the delivery .
 and it was just easier to put a failed attempt ,  and reschedule for someone else to do it .
 update ,  1 of my parcel just got picked up from seller ,  est delivery 4-6 may .
 picked up from seller is the easy part .
 reaching the warehouse for processing is a different ball game all together
 chiu know my  &apos;pick up from seller part &apos; oredi took 1 week
 its the last mile carrier chiu have to cross your fingers for .
 out of 100 times ,  qoo10 never failed me .
 out of 10 times ,  lazada failed all times .
 my parcels from two orders placed with the same seller within 5 minutes of each other was picked up together last wednesday .
 originally ,  both were scheduled to be delivered by tomorrow (tuesday) .
 but now one parcel &apos;s delivery date has been pushed back a week .
 and the other parcel no news no sound no picture .
 i think they are too busy counting the $247 , 000 , 000 .
 my first time having issues with ninjavan and it &apos;s during this cb period .
 early stage of cb my deliveries were still good .
 when i receive the sms that ninja is on the way ,  confirm that day late afternoon period ,  some guy will come
 dhl delivered my google store product from tw in 3-4 days .
 ninjavan if i not wrong they collect all the items and store in warehouse for a fews days before dispatching all the items in order to reduce the amount of trips made for bulk delivery .
 lucky i choose qoo in the past .
 i didnt know the difference between these 2 ,  and oso dunno what carousel sh !
 just randomly chose qoo even though i saw more lazada ads .
 two weeks to deliver a package within singapore .
 dhl oredi circled the globe 7 times in that 2 weeks .
 qxpress so far yet to disappoint for their next day delivery even if they couldnt perform as so the very next day parcel will reach nevertheless .
 cant say the same for ninjavan during this period  .
 1 week has past and parcel whereabouts is like stuck in the middle of pacific ocean .
 given the same period of time ,  cheena couriers would have oredi reach from northern shanghai to southern guangzhou within a matter of days !
 ninjavan delivery sucks ,  just lost one of my item
 i’m surprised that alot of companies oso engage their service  .
 they should hire more people if they are facing issues .
 their problem is not really with the number of people .
 but the attitude of their people .
 if they see your location not easy get to ,  its easier to put as failed delivery on their part .
 and then thats where the magic of your disappearing parcel starts .
 never engage part time staff whom come & go easily  .
 interact with like least 6 different never drivers within a 6 mths span .
 the reply i got from an ex never driver was overloaded with parcels to be delivered within a day of more than 14 working hours & penalisation will be imposed if they couldnt meet delivery standards .
 my area used to be a minimart owner who helps distribute ninja parcels .
 ninajvan will dump the entire area &apos;s load on him then he will cycle to distribute .
 when he was on the job ,  deliveries were super consistent for me .
 like smrt trying to focus on retail rental revenue and marketing rather than the core of their offering ,  which is rooted in engineering .
 never focuses on producing glitzy and pretty videos of their service but fail to deliver on their basics of delivery .
 finally got ninjavan thread !
 message chiu 4am say delivering but never tell chiu time slot .
 reach oredi oso dunno how to call .
 if chio one go sark uncles kukujiao then can be saved liao .
 sry i dont take sloppy seconds 
 chiu failed management and leadership skills .
 ok free lessons for chiu to tackle atbs .
 never ever mention bad times or bad events ,  when chiu want to impress the other party .
 always say good and happy things .
 i dont like your accusation of me being a scammer .
 many hundred of edmwers have added me ,  and all of them has seen my atbs photos and videos .
 none of them regretted .
 knn that is what pap say  .
 how can they be oni gd times ,  anyway inside wechat all look like chicken looking for their next customer 
 many jobless atbs ,  waiting for chiu guys to rescue them from hardship .
 first gal from start and second gal at 7:05mins .
 can skip the middle guy .
 anyone wants to save this two ?
 just need watch the first part .
 the other parts not interesting .
 this pretty atb got a 7yr old son .
 any one wants to save her from a useless hubby ?
 this one 26yrs old atb ,  may need edmwer bbfa to help her after retrenchment .
 anyone wants to volunteer ?
 directly skip to 6:00min for a desperate atb that is very desperate for any bbfa edmwer to help her with money woes .
 chiu guys should go xinjiang and save these gals .
 they have one of the most exotic looks .
 ts bring them in and pimp them ?
 they can do onlyfans if cheena firewall didnt block .
 in before double entendre thread
 last time robbery oso wear motorbike helmet one
 which mall is this ?
 a nation of drivers and food delivery .
 /me imagines edmw pirdbird post .
 not the helmet nor entering i had in mind !
 cos they cannot see his yandao face on cctv .
 cos cant see forehead mah .
 the screen cant read his temperature .
 they should remove helmet when entering malls/ shops/ banks/ food center .
 if not ,  we &apos;ll soon have many robberies .
 ya la ,  cant read like wearing a cap with the temp machine  .
 how to scan temperature  ?
 how cctv spot your face  ?
 and nothing u can do about it .
 support removing helmet .
 for security purpose  , nothing wrong asking them to remove helmet .
 maybe dont want family or friends to recognize him during food delivery
 knn here jb ar ?
 since i oso prefer not to wear helmet when entering ,  i sarpork the mall 
 removing helmet is to prevent robbery hiding their faces .
 my ex asked to me remove helmet before entering ,  i regret never listen to her
 do u feel assured that the next pandemic u no need worry cos papaya will rescue u ?

 so need to give tiny thing lor
 i think miw is ready to lose more come 2025 .
 but if chiu know chiu r going to lose liao chiu want to minimise the loss right ?
 i mean ,  lose tanjong pagar grc bigger deal or lose ec grc smaller deal ?
 chiu know what i mean ?
 they realised the younger generation is not so easy to coax and conform unlike mg/pg .
 so use some small money make the mg/pg happy keep tanjong pagar grc why not right ?
 imagine losing tp grc ?
 i think lky will wake up from his grave 
 ya now really feel like voting them
 free money how often give
 maybe tp grc wouldnt be lost in the next election but rather in the subsequent ones
 give money better
 those things are not free la ,  u think money out of their own pocket mei ?

 this is not a game of cards ,  its your life and mine
 ‘and the course which the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic is setting reflects the government &apos;s judgment on how best to do this ,  he added .
 take note : anything goes wrong ,  not me .

 unvax fts can roam freely while unvax sinkies cannot go anywhere .

 but of course the traitors can let ceca come in
 normally around this time will have
 latest by end of this year life will return to quite normal state
 actually ,  in real life ,  some people are oredi predicting that travel bubbles will soon be available ,  a few months from now ,  as singapore is going to achieve herd immunity in a few months from now .
 im personally looking forward to no need wear mask unless chiu are sick .
 np later limpeh will make a call to make it 3 cases today then tomorrow 0 liao no need worry .
 should be soon oso i feel ,  at least outdoors
 then can go holiday liao

 i oso wokeup this morning with a magical feeling and then i went toilet .
 angmo cuntries oredi life back to normal
 but ah gui oredi left the human realm liao .

 why ah gui can dream ?
 ah gui got bad intention .

 for me between these two - definitely the sony
 will bose brand impress people more ?
 what is your music source ?
 welly pain after awhile .
 of cos is bose la high ses angmo brand
 i will pick the sony .
 how much is it by the way ?
 is that why xm3 so much cheaper than xm4 ?
 bose: buy other sound equipment  .
 your answer is there
 the other alternative would be momentum 2 .
 bose ,  most likely at the bottom of the list .
 what is the original price ?
 sony one definitely ,  the wf xm4 oso is one of the better ones on the market
 sony ,  is there even a fight here ?
 xm4 noise cancelling cannot fight
 xm4 is the latest one ,  so that one loh .
 this one no need think .
 sony is the one
 provided no bodyguards entourage surrounding her .

 good afternoon #notmypresident .

 sinkies ,  at ease !
 just another aunty ,  dont block my way can liao .
 grab and kiss her hands saying maaf yang di pertuan agung .
 tell her nasi lemak one packet dont wan peanut and ikan bilis
 i would not greet her .
 nasi lemak satu .

 if inside shopping centre must diam everyone then must shout good afternoon/ morning then must ask for permission to carry on
 lucky chiu met her before covid .
 i think it is fated to meet her .
 congrats to chiu .
 is she around your age too ?
 i know is cd3 but now i am still more inclined towards attending activity that i am interested in as compared to activity with high female proportion .
 it is hard for me to fake fake and do things i am not interested in just to attract or know girls from there .
 i do play sports with my friends .
 i feel i stand a better chance in a place where i can perform better than in a place filled with ladies but unable to perform and communicate more naturally
 actually chasing women is simple .
 but it &apos;s simple: it &apos;s a social skill ,  and just like any other social skill ,  it can he cultivated .
 how far chiu go depends on your determination and aptitude .
 at high levels of skill amazing things are possible .
 but even some basic skill is definitely better than no skill .
 some are naturals ,  like mly .
 it &apos;s super rare to find a guy like him who &apos;s willing to share cos most guys with the skill are out getting girls ,  why would they bother with teaching bbfas ?
 but all chiu guys are just whining and gnashing your teeth instead of taking a great opportunity to watch and learn .
 mly is in action in this forum !
 bro chiu still bergin ?
 alot of divorcee and single there .
 i actually came across one thread from there which ponders me about being attached and married .
 the husband is very devoted to his hobby just like what i am doing weekly playing sports with my friends  .
 however ,  the wife complain that he rather do hobbies with friends on weekends than helping out in the house .
 i am oso a little bit confused by this and she wish to divorce .
 i wonder how will i react if my partner is like that
 go slim down and be fit zai !
 yes its really fated  .
 my initial plan was to go nz ,  and i was looking for nz tour during natas 2019  .
 but i stumble across this central europe tour that cover 6 country ,  and not very expensive ,  i decided to take it up last min .
 as for her  ,  she did not sign up for the tour until 3 weeks before departure date ,  she last min sign up the tour cos she left her job due to some issue .
 and decided to join her parents for the trip  .
 so yeah ,  if i did not stumble across this tour package n go ahead with my nz plan ,  i would not have met her .
 if she did not left her job n did not join the tour at the very last min  ,  she would not have met me .
 yup ,  there are people whom actually met their destine in such situation also
 well that is purple pill liao .
 black pill is fully closed to romance and self-blame circumstances ,  which is in many cases true to some extent .
 if open to long-term romance ,  will neither fall into red/black pill .
 the pill is more of a mindset perspective rather than the demographic that fits it .
 but of course ,  usually the demographic that fits the black pill is as what i described earlier .
 hope to meet my soul mates during travelling then .
 i like to go hiking ,  mountain trips overseas ,  skiing  .
  or even cultural places like bhutan  ,  tibet  .
 i like to play sports too
 hi exidbeast ,  yes i remember chiu .
 yes your answers are correct .
 chiu score 1 bonus point too for sniffing out milf haha 
 yeah u can join a group of tourist  ,  random tour group that goes day trip to hiking or scenery trip ,  u may actually encounter someone there ,  sometimes there solo tourist female that travel alone .
 and that is your chance to try to see if u can strike a convo or even get into some chemistry
 i think evil sun is black pill .
 maybe we can give advice to people like ts ,  evilsun ,  noob ,  and those facing issue with dating .
 i myself has learn to let go  ,  if it comes then bonus .
 i think ssfa can consider foreign girls not trying to criticise them cos i am oso not tall .
 i think foreigners are more willing to accept their flaws compared to local girls who are surrounded by guys of taller build ,  better looking guys .
 haha me a mixture of black and purple .
 closed to romance .
 focus on improving and enjoying ownself lol
 do chiu have any sources where to find like a one day to three days kind of hiking ,  scenery trips ?
 i am interested  ,  i did see one local group starting from singapore hiking experience moving up to overseas expenditure with payments of course .
 however ,  i lost information on that group .
 need to improve on my photo taking skills too .
 not really good at taking nice pictures for people so far  .
 my female friends are always asking me to retake cos doesn’t look nice enough to them .
 sorry ,  i cant like your post cos chiu speak too highly of me .
 i am just a normal guy ,  and i have all along thought my dating history is atypical of all guys .
 i am just willing to help .
 wa molanyong i sad oredi  .
 chiu never reply me haha .
 by the way your surname sounds really bad  .
 very honoured to be scoring 4/3 for a 3 question test !
 on a more serious note ,  i went to check out singaporemotherhood forums .
 i found alot of csb threads but got some like real concern issue .
 reminded me of the old flowerpot forums .
 still reading the thread for some real and true advice .
 where services such as grab delivery are oredi using live location ,  and amazon prime updates chiu where the delivery guy is on the map ,  this ninjavan is still on a deliver between 2 may to 5 may by 10pm .
 this level of detail (or lack thereof) is simply unimaginable in the year 2020 .
 wa i read this thread a bit worried lol i got one shopee parcel just picked up by never .
 simi sia ,  for real ?
 wa thats something new  .
 for me so as long delivered as per eta .
 i &apos;ll contented  .
 imagine tracing the exact status then they just go round about again & again non stop  .
 see oso wanna faint .
 so far my parcels never once arrived on weekends / ph .
 quite standard if friday never get means monday / tuesday .
 maybe i am one of the lucky few but think never backlog easing .
 my shopee purchase from local seller order placed last wed just got delivered by never this morning .
 my purchases back in early april took about 2 weeks for never delivery .
 abut about 2 mths back use never .
 received items ,  usually the following day .
 coincidentally ,  never has good cs and quick delivery compared to shytpost ,  for me .
 so the estimated delivery is not accurate now hor .
 have 1 parcel de estimated delivery date is today but no text from them and tracking is still under  &apos;picked up from sender &apos; .
 i have never delivery at least once monthly form shopee/lazada .
 never had any issues with late delivery too .
 oni gotch one time i chose free delivery to ninja point .
 cause home delivery got fees .
 then the ninja point full .
 ask me pick another place .
 then wait another 3 days .
 better than amarex ?
 in ljvan tread .
 my experience is ,  the issue is almost always the driver allocated for your area .
 be it the pick up on the seller side or the delivery to customer side .
 if chiu have a good ,  hardworking person on both ends ,  chiu will have experience .
 today pickup tomorrow receive .
 but if either one side (or both) the guy cannot make it or very bo chup ,  chiu will have negative experience .
 then after awhile they will change the guy cos the feedback is very poor .
 then see your luck whether chiu get good guys for your routes .
 wait till chiu try jt network lol .
 especially during this period ,  if chiu have things chiu need urgently then best to not order online .
 personally since im usually enjoying free or minimal amount in delivery fees to have it delivered to my doorstep i think give and take la .
 except for one annoying experience i had where the delivery guy was shouting my unit number along the corridor to my unit like some kind of ahlong  
 this one siaolang .
 or maybe last day on the job .
 ninja normally ,  if not all the time ,  will sms in the morning of delivery .
 i feel thats good cos then we &apos;ll know there &apos;s a package coming .
 j&t does that too .
 but none of the others that i &apos;ve encountered so far ,  does that .
 parcels not being pickup by them is common after the home business saga .
 all courier cannot pickup from home last week .
 ninjavan lose to qxpress .
 never send sms quite meaningless cos they can always reschedule or claim delivery attempted but failed .
 ever happened to me received sms saying parcel will be delivered today ,  end up nothing .
 next day ,  same routine .
 eventually actual delivery oni made on 3rd day .
 picked up from sender is far far from being delivered .
 there is a need to send to warehouse .
 then another need to dispatch to delivery man .
 few mths ago still posting
 edmw truly is the swamp of singapore .
 must faster close down to prevent further rot .
 amdl is notch bad 
 ts ,  where have chiu been these past 2 months ?
 wow ,  she very chio and ideal mummy for moi children .
 if can merry her best .
 must close down tik tok instead
 where have chiu been ts ?
 saw this so long ago .
 who the hell is she  .
 amdl will tio karma if she rude to other people .
 it is apparent real
 seems like our degree is useless .
 waste time and money .
 i go and take uptron deg
 pap is betraying singaporeans
 what is mom doing ?
 degree mill medicine degree ok ?
 buying a phd now !
 my friend in it said these degree mills folks .
 ask them do simple troubleshoot they dont even know .
 some more they getting good pay
 tiagong if know what &apos;s panadol can pass alrdy .
 what is a degree mill ?
 any example from singapore ?
 degree mill not fake degree cos not ownself print hok
 so what if they are degree mills ?
 if mom and joteo look at the background of these foreigners and sees them as talents ,  then they benefit sinkies .
 who are we to question mom whether or not these foreigners are talents ?
 have faith and trust the pap .
 dont see why we need to make the differentiation between degree mill and fake degree .
 they are still unqualified .
 if those from degree mill can qualify based on experience ,  then why will anyone spend money and effort to get a proper education ?
 going to set up my uni called tan ah kou national university and sell degree mill !
 singapore accept it !
 what if i print out my own certificate from wife beating university ?
 so it is recognised as a degree just unaccredited ?
 degree mills or fake degrees it doesnt matter .
 if mom gives ep means they have checked the background of these foreigners and oni let the truly talented ones into singapore .
 we must trust the foreign talent policies of the pap that benefit sinkies .
 dont be xenophobic .
 if we choose building materials that must be tested by accredited lab then why employees cannot ?
 why do we want liars ?
 someone having a fake degree can still be a talent .
 we must be open to foreign talent to improve the lives of sinkies .
 creating jobs for foreigners benefit sinkies ,  this includes foreigners with fake degrees who are still talents .
 alternatively ,  can look at samsung galaxy buds pro also

 how come ear buds will have pain one .
 tempted to pull the trigger but how to tackle the ear cushion peel prob after a while ?
 the sony support is cmi .
 i like the sound ,  but the support is bu ky .
 so no more xm4 for me .
 i would recommend momentum 2 .
 airpods max la .
 don’t need to think .
 bose is an indian founded company
 sony is famous for sonic quality  .
 bose is an indian company  .
 make your own conclusions
 was thinking of getting the xm4 .
 but difficult to connect to in flight entertainment is a no no for me so im still on the headphones with cable connections .
 if they have an adaptor(must be able to store with the cradle) to connect to inflight .
 i will order right away
 doesnt really matter since both oso using bluetooth .
 bose = buy other sound equipment
 all their support is awful .
 and never buy sennheiser   .
 for starters the volume is very very soft on it
 and they are quite rubbish .
 honestly ,  i might not even recognise her … 
 hi mdm notmypresident .
 milo siu dai satu
 makcik ,  milo peng satu !
 she is invisible to me .
 i won’t even look at her .
 respect is earned  ,  not given .
 frankly  ,  any kpop star or tech ceo will received a better crowd
 one milo dinosaur please .
 shout “no chicken eat fish” .
 oni if no bodyguard entourage .
 makcik ,  satu milo dinosaur  .
 hello milo auntie  
 squeeze one fart and walk boh hiu her .
 nothing ,  can’t see anything .
 salute and shout milo gao siudai !
 hormat the president first .
 chiu never been guard of honor ?
 how u accidentally bump into her ?
 the bodyguards will wrestle u to the ground before u do that .
 for sure they will at least give u a light shove
 stare what stare ?
 if got bodyguard she might greet u still .
 no bodyguard no camera rolling ,  it’s really up to her personality which i can’t conclude since idk her personally .
 but i believe a good president should greet u too and u a citizen should show some respect to her (if she don’t want interaction with peasants ,  then she should jolly well remain in her ivory tower and sing frozen)
 assamulaukum mak ceeek  .
 pretend never see .
 greet her got money take anot ?

 there are alot of fans who are being cheated by ybb selling a branded bag and her yt channel .
 they have no one to stand up for them so they get ly to voice out since she got more powder .
 gy see it as an act of cyber-bullying and trying to be famous over the suicide saga .
 i see it as some sort of mis-understanding among them .
 ly dunnid to step on some one to be successful .
 she is just speaking out for the fans .
 however ,  there is a ytb couple that are obviously riding on the suicide to project themselves as some justice warrior .
 u talking abt the indian couple  ?
 are they indian  ?
 i dont think so .
 they should be the one riding on the saga .
 maybe they do not know the magnitude and amount of money that ybb have cheated from her fans .
 seems like it is done on purpose and clear intention to cheat .
 if they are cyber-bullying for speaking out ,  then who can they turn to  ?
 no dick bloody ?
 chiu know i just started using bumble  ,  alot of ladies that are on my feed are vegetarian  .
 i don’t know how to deal with it if i happen to be interested in one of them .
 hi curiousbo7 ,  chiu got any links ?
 i see the forum there alot of csb but i am reading the thread of wives with unfaithful partners now .
 quite a different kind of environment as compared to edmw  
 you &apos;re a normal guy but with some very interesting experiences and skills that can help these guys change their lives  .
 the 1% who are open to listening .
 i hope that by trying to make things super obvious to the bbfas here we can move the needle to 2% 
 actually depends if that is a dealbreaker leh .
 i set my boundaries straight ,  i want to eat food .
 i really dont see any chance of dating someone with dietary restrictions (apart from allergies) .
 chiu need to see if chiu really can forgo .
 if no go ,  then i suggest just tell them straight that chiu cant do 100% vegetarian .
 dont be afraid to lose women chiu havent get
 no link is just under matter of the heart
 liddat i might as well continue single
 thats chiu have the luck ,  ah gui have none of it .
 and very hard for fas like ah gui to not expect love when we have been looking for it all the time .
 does pretending to not expect it works ?
 i guy dont dare go woman dominated forum .
 scared kena whacked lol
 is always either religion or dietary or family .
 my first ex was cos of religion i not ready to convert and go church .
 she keep ask me go  .
 second one is family issue gambling and father womanizing after that i don’t really have much luck with average girls as alot of red flags such as punctuality issue ,  insecurity  ,  playing hard to get and just boring communication which i have to keep asking questions and continue the conversation forcefully .
 it’s really not easy to find someone that has some chemistry and affection with .
 y is there a need to look ?
 love ownself first .
 and ghost need love one meh
 or just state your ground .
 find girls that appreciate meat .
 chiu will like them better anyway .
 and bumble is not that good la cos that app allow the girls to be too much in control for the partner selection process i .
 e; they are the hunter now and it might create a weird dynamic .
 yes ah gui needs love  .
 ah gui kind of semi give up liao but still look forward to the day i meet my so :frown%
 love yourself first bah  .
 if u dunno how to enjoy and love yourself .
 how to love others
 chiu never mention eat zai leh .
 one eat zai and one eat cai png how ah .
 some edmwers say just skip maybe i just skip .
 a bit tough la to give up meat i am born to eat all the nice food .
 can be done de if the zai store cook until can make the mock meat texture taste like real meat .
 the zai stall must be delicious for me to give up meat .
 else can eat mah la .
 zai oso can eat mah la with no meat .
 else is eat lei cha stall lor  .
 that one oso zai
 at the end of the day ,  got people hire them ,  taken in by their degree mill or never check ,  then mom take it as good .
 cant really fault mom .
 i believe they never expected companies to be so slack in their hiring process .
 chiu know how these public sectors work .
 sad hard truth and a generation of local grab driver and delivery men is the result of this .
 moe agrees to that
 meaning getting any useless lousy degree oso can get hired .
 as long as the hiring manager wanna hire .
 sho makes no difference .
 haha and that brings us to the point that degrees are useless !
 but we have been bred with the fear that no degree means dead .
 singapore set too high standard oredi when most companies dont really need that  &apos;high &apos; qualifications .
 and 60% approves
 sic carousell link pls
 meanwhile sinkie ite cert kena scrutinize as stupid and slow learner
 degree mill is 3rd party set up school to give anyone a degree .
 forged cert is chiu make your own cert from existing school chiu did not study at .
 its like u ownself print = forged degree .
 let others print for chiu = degree mill .
 how is diploma/degree mill not different from forged certs ?
 knn ivory tower really like to spin all sorts of logics to sweep under carpet .
 there are still foreign talents who are really talented and truly good in what they do despite having fake degrees .
 i am glad mom chose to award them with eps so they can benefit sinkies .
 unaccredite degree / degree mill means chiu do exams can anyhow open book do .
 means chiu do exam no one is watching etc  .
 for me both is fake
 if true ,  time to close down all the varsities here .
  ahlian ahbeng all can become ceo ,  coo ,  cfo  .
 ite these days very rare to see any ad with requirement for ite .
 not to mention ite is on the level of o level but compare  .
 with those who buy/print certs .
 at least those who go through ite had education as well as  .
 setup own uni and print own degree = degree mill .
 ownself print degree from oxford uni = fake degree
 i always think that if really want to get foreigners ,  should get better quality ones ,  ie accredited degrees .
 if its from nonaccredited mills ,  then y not just get local sim grad ?
 oh unaccredited oso can huh lol .
 unaccredited means can anyhow  .
 chiu do exam no one checking if chiu are cheating .
 basically it is the same as fake degree
 some even dont neee to take exam
 no time to ownself check ownself ?
 ownself no time check ownself to explain
 no time to explain why oneself check ownself is a virtue .
 ownself explain ownself with no time to check .
 who said no time to explain ?
 did i miss any sagat ?
 i think it will be a total silence
 means 61% will continue to vote for pap to screw sinkies upside down 
 the country is gg le
 means got the ultimate blank cheaque ,  no transparency and no accountabilities .
 really shameless for people especially some minister to support the idea of ownself check ownself .
 no time to check ownself ,  explain ownself explain ?
 no time to ownself check ownself explain

 chiu havent mentioned how they jelly with young gen earn  from crypto .
 its never enough for selfish gen
 i bet alll my money ,  boomers made more money from crypto than anyone else .
 young gen can earn what from crypto ?
 lol good for them .
 meanwhile boomers take $10000 from their children per year
 blame hitler lah
 granted it &apos;s not all boomers ,  it &apos;s just a bunch of narcissistic boomers out there who think the world is all about themselves and they are gods .
 no possible to be alone without bodyguard one .

 yes chiu are right .
 qoo is surprising very very steady .
 i was even pleasantly surprised with a same day delivery !
 ts is more pissed with ninja than singpost ?
 my ninjavan item 1 week plus still haven deliver .
 qxpress i got it within 3 days .
 qxpress has been consistently great for the past 2-3 years .
 before that ,  they were quite bad .
 moreover ,  now qxpress delivery fee is cheaper($1 .
 free over certain amount spent) compared to where it used to cost $4-5 .
 thats why nowadays for higher value items i rather pay more and get from qoo10 compared to shopee or laz so i wont have to deal with delivery nightmares .
 i oso preferred qxpress over ninjavan .
 it &apos;s been 1 week since ninjavan took my item from seller .
 knn singapore how small oni oso need to take more than 1 week and it &apos;s not even delivered yet  .
 i think it differs for every area .
 the ninja delivery guys at my side are exemplary .
 always very prompt and responsible; they &apos;ll call and then whatsapp with pictures of where they place the items if you &apos;re not around .
 lazada i oredi gave up .
 looks like i must visit qoo more
 now i see ninjavan i phobia .
 i got a parcel seller shipped on the 2nd ,  ninjavan picked up and in the warehouse on the 3rd ,  received a text today saying is out for delivery .
 will i get the parcel today ?
 can reach i happy oredi .
 my 2nd parcel ordered to pick up from seller on 27/4 just got picked up like a few minutes ago .
 now they eta delivery 05 may to 02 may .
 looks like they got time machine ah
 nowadays buy from overseas can get faster than buying local lmao
 why lazada use oni ninjavan .
 cannot use qxpress ?
 i like ninjavan
 my maiden aliexpress purchase tio stuck with singpost for nearly 2 months .
 1st and last time buying from aliexpress .
   dont want to have anything to do with singpost again
 nowadays ,  for lazada no (at least) 3 weeks ,  no talk .
 alex had 3/4 as much money as ben at first .
 after alex and ben each gave away $250 to charity ,  alex had 1/3 as much money as ben .
 how much did alex had at first .
 there were 3/4 as many boys as girls in a classroom .
 after 14 boys n 14 girls left ,  there were 2/5 as many boys as girls left .
 how many pupils were there in the classroom in the end ?
 edmw notch yr mad tickcher  ,  ghost do yr homewerk
 can chiu stop using edmw to do your kid’s homework ?
 moreover ,  this is a ridiculously simple problem of common denominators .
 i neber do any equation .
 pattern too obvious .
 i stopped for a while cos  i let her bring to her tuition teacher .
 but her tuition is on saturday but her homework is due tomorrow .
 if i’m good i won’t ask .
 your kid learnt ratio yet or not ?
 this is a heuristic called external transfer with constant difference .
 basically ,  chiu need to make the constant difference the same number of units ,  hence chiu have to times the before scenario by 2 to get the same as the after scenario .
 i &apos;ve done the first one for chiu ,  chiu can try for the 2nd question .
 let me clarify what i meant .
 since both boys gave away the same amount of money ,  the difference between the 2 boys is still the same .
 i tabulated the before scenario and the after scenario using ratio .
 the difference in the first scenario is 1 unit but in the after scenario ,  its 2 units .
 however ,  they should be the same .
 how can we make them the same ?
 we can multiply the whole before scenario by 2 so that the difference becomes 2 units .
 then i can see that alex originally had 6 units and ended up with 1 unit .
 so he gave away 5 units .
 thats why i equate 5 units to $250 (the amount given away) .
 this oso cannot solve ,  then really must go back to pri school to restart learning math
 from first statement: a = (3/4)b  .
 2nd question same pattern .
 just curious ,  what is your education level and math grades ?
 so ts got 2 accounts ?
 saw another account replying thanks to one of the solver then was deleted immediately  .
 tomorrow go school earlier to copy
 what  primary school teacher will teach chiu is to recognise the constant .
 in this question ,  since they both gave the same amount away ,  the difference between  them before and after is the constant or the same ,  and hence the working and answer is in post #6
 big troller or what ?
 thanks for the rehash on anal skewer .
 i had a good laugh .

 ts just crawled out from which cave
 can imagine her every night getting destroyed by this 110kg beast    .
 galaxy buds is the way to go .
 what about liberty soundcore 3 pro ?
 i didnt have to send back my sennheiser .
 sony ,  i had to send back twice and the problem wasn &apos;t fixed after a down time of over a month .
 so sennheiser for the win .
 as for volume ,  maybe chiu should consider a hearing aid .
 i dont think they can repair .
 they just give chiu a new one .
 sennheiser both generations are very soft in volume .
 i have to increase by close to 50% of the sony then the details as done by the musician comes out .
 for the sony and other earbuds ,  a bit more than 50% of maximum volume is oredi considered loud .
 if i tune it to same volume as sennheiser then its really unbearable .
 not loud but unbearable  .
 i know certain music or songs will sound better with the sony .
 famous for fantastic in store demonstration but at home ,  chiu cant reproduce what chiu heard in store
 i have both the xm4 and buds pro .
 sound and anc wise ,  definitely sony but buds pro isn’t too far away .
 samsung’s galaxy buds series are more suitable for samsung phones as compatibility wise is second to none .
 i use the xm4 on my samsung phone as well ,  paired it with tidal hifi and ldac turned on ,  it’s among the best sound quality chiu can get for a tws .
 been using it for a month .
 the anc is no joke .
 the sound are very balance .
 sound profile is subjective .
 on personal preference .
 on your off day ,  go find an audio shop and test the sound profile for each brand .
 chiu will  tend to find a few brands that feels just right .
 at that point ,  just need to balance out cost and comfort .
 downside is chiu wont have time to test long term comfort or durability .
 personally ,  i ended up with sony .
 cos i found their in-ear earphones and on ear headphones are the oni one i can wear long term .
 moi gotch fat ears 
 i was considering the samsungs but review wise ,  the sound isnt fantastic .
 better off getting the new generation sonys .
 i can tell chiu avoid sennheiser .
 the sony mark 3 beats the sennheiser mark 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 etc etc
 i say go for airpods pro if chiu are using iphones ,  ipads ,  macs
 oni their headfi stuffs are good/brilliant .
 the rest like amps ,  gaming headphones etc .
 chiu got cat ears ?
 there &apos;s  a skill in wearing the sonys .
 need to put in ear and twist a bit .
 need to select the proper ear bud too .
 but no such issues with the mark 4 .
 its smaller than mark 3
 just got mine from 11 .
 $262 after discounts ,  export set .
 dont get the local sony ones at $300+ .
 boycott their overpricing mechanism .
 have the xm3 too ,  but this one is just so ever slightly better .
 was awed by the soundstage .
 use proper eartips ,  for me i use the jvc spiraldots .
 ya probably too big for moi .
 thought such a renowned brand will be great in sonics .
 turns out sony is the best .
 even sony movies are good to the best in sound even if the movie content is shite
 sony soundwise is really good .
 and functionality is good too .
 chiu can use each bud individually but sennheiser ,  the newer model can &apos;t
 i oso have the xm3 and is oredi very good ,  but i’ve since retired it after getting xm4 .
 i’ve never used sennheiser though ,  but oso have all 3 generations of b&o e8 family .
 the b&os have better sound clarity than sony ,  but bass isn’t too strong .
 i’ve owned before the galaxy buds+ before the buds pro and buds pto have improved sq overall over buds+ .
 honestly speaking ,  samsung buds family  have pretty decent sq ,  but they’re best used with their phones ,  similarly as i’m using airpods pro solely on my iphone .
 sony has bad reviews for mic quality even worse than the predecessor .
 so if that’s a concern better not .
 i own the xm3 ,  the mic oredi very avg
 these days they listen to this .
 jin classic leh
 nope ,  i listen to wonder girls
 like retired liao .
 sighs ,  last time kpop still nice knn come to 2020 all these simi blackpink and bts with pink hair purple hair dunno what they singing oso 
 apink is ok mah  .
 eunji is cute af
 wear cute cute ,  wave lollipop or do crab dance .
 i tried learning korean .
 it nearly killed me .
 its one of the first languages that i &apos;d ever learnt that i did not take a huge liking to .
 and i am a polygot .
 i still prefer tiffany ,  sunny and yuri 
 they listen to .
 i prefer got meat one .
 yoona is chio but too skinny liao .
 please try this instead .
 seohyun is chio and got meat leh
 i not greedy la .
 tiffany ,  sunny and yuri 3 i enough liao 
 i dont like the styling and makeup nowadays .
 dunno why more and more complicated liddat .
 if chiu no effort to work out and keep fit no1 can help chiu .
 or lower your standards ,  .
 then u chase 8-9/10 ( provided u mulit millionaire type ez then ) .
 got logic or not ?
 actually ts can retire liao .
 can bbfa til gg
 korkor ,  moi can introduced chiu to fass girls ,  but chiu will hiam local uni anot ?
 teach us now to make 200k from stock leh .
 200k can buy a 2rm bto still got change .
 sounds like me except i dont have 200k 
 what is wrong with uniqlo and sandals and sport shoes ?
 ya lor uniqlo so much better than hang10 .
 does that affect the answer ?
 join dating apps talk to any girl u matched with take this as training to know more about girls what they want/what they expecting/what they looking for .
 be it ugly or pretty give it a try and know them maybe an ugly girl is able to give u more advice else u might know more of her friends etc , 
 your avatar make up too thick scares me when i surfing edmw in the middle of the nite
 wearing uniqlo is fine ,  but sports shoes must match with the appropriate attire ,  and sandals are a no-no .
 the main thing for chiu to improve on is that chiu need to exercise to get fit ,  and meet and talk to more people .
 probably join events or hobby meetups ?
 i don’t really have specific examples on how or where chiu can meet people ,  but i realise those events that would definitely require chiu to interact with others (usually in a group setting) ,  would allow chiu to get to know more people and improve your conversation skills too .
 if such events last for the entire day or it’s a 2-day event ,  there would be a higher chance that people are more willing to make friends ,  provided the conversation vibe is good la .
 always be prepared for failure and rejections of course ,  but never underestimate the importance of being willing to take the first step to improve yourself !
 i don’t think it’s wise to set up an instagram account and post photos solely just for attracting girls ,  unless chiu want to go for those girls who oso like to post photos on instagram .
 if chiu want to create an account ,  do it for yourself .
 but ya ,  do create an account to see how the platform works and oso explore its features .
 chiu can follow pages and hashtags that interest chiu ,  or even some inspiration for art and craftwork (can be a new hobby haha) .
 but when asked ,  be honest that chiu want to get to know new people though .
 cos some girls out there are looking for a serious partner ,  don’t waste their time if you’re not interested in them .
 no ,  i will treat  
 fass girls alot chio bu and artsy fartsy type huans  
 moi love thick makeup 
 her avatar pretty leh .
 looks like anne hathaway 
 just join a gym membership or hire a personal trainer ffs
 i trade exclusively us stocks .
 but i took high risks(aka going almost all-in) and oso caught a few stocks in a row that went up by alot .
 let &apos;s just say i am an anomaly and it &apos;s not easy for most to replicate what i did .
 yes 200k can easily pay down-payment and loan installment pay off through salary .
 but i am currently still happy to live with my parents   and besides i am single .
 so i use my money to just buy myself some nice stuff lor .
 or eat nice food dunnid think about price just eat only
 save churself the pain and trouble  stay single sua .
 know ownself short and fugly then dontch be eyesore chup siao with zhabors la .
 society now place alot of value on looks one .
 the wife is la the guy is not
 google gatita yan leng yein .
 tbh nothing much
 i now understand
 i recalled she is mixed parenthood .
 this couple is creating saga all the time .
 dunno which one is real or fake .
 other couples videoed pranks .
 they go and dig saga .
 that is my take of the issue .
 not sure they have any war and fight at the moment .
 never heard of any sagat
 polypropylene vs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
 pinky dunno whether to close or open .
 so ,  he chose a weird mix of both ,  aka clopen .
 sounds like he run out of ideas oredi .
 keep pushing for vaccinations while seeing cases maintaining at 3k+ .
 hope there isnt some new variant coming in from the visitors .
 why don’t he just drop dead
 lol then may i ask why are so many trave lane open ?
 his rip lao beh going to rise up from grave
 sad to said this .
 but chiu and your team oredi lost the way  .
 im worried next time got a new virus when im old miw will sacrifice me 
 what does mdm ho have to say about this  &apos;clopen &apos;
 i &apos;ll be forthright and say this ,  many will die and they will likely be in the higher age groups .
 the mrna vaccine is our best solution right now to mitigate what we are experiencing ,  although we do not know for certain the effects 20 , 50 years down the road .
 that ,  is a bet we have to take as there are no better options .
 we have 3 options .
 2) herd immunity .
 1) we cannot and will not survive that .
 i dont think i have to go into the nitty gritty why .
 2) the hospitals would be overwhelmed .
 3) this is our best bet right now ,  although it is not cast in stone .
 for me ,  thats the way i see it .
 not ib ,  just my thoughts .
 for me ,  if gahment is forthright (which i dont think is the case .
 they think we are imbeciles) ,  im easy .
 are there any solutions other than the 3 above ?
 can chiu take the lead by resuming meet-the-people sessions in all your party &apos;s constituencies ?
 covid is just a flu ,  there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
 tiagong a man that lost his prostate is as a good as losing his ji .
 pinky are definitely one of them .
 in other simple words .
 half fark measure !
 lky would have taken a different stand .
 i predict local variant coming up to a point the cases fuck up we wasted all the good work in curbing and back to square one .
 wait i predict maybe worse than square one cos then it probably become a mess .
 instead of transforming the business to cope ,  want to resume the old way by incurring risk lmao any one from private sector would have rofl .
 this guy die 10 deaths oso still owe cecapoor many mani .
 too bad stinkies onri can llst
 more like meet his marker if allow meet session… .
 they all more kiasi then anyone else
 shebal this guy
 got very xiasuay or not ?
 buay tong liao ah need to raid reserves
 cheena ccp likes to ownself punish ownself ,  classic tiong mentality .
 still remember last time got people say cheena dont depend on aussie coal  say what oni 5 , 10% of their total consumption nia .
 aussie prepare to go bankrupt with nearly 1/3 of their export dependent on cheena 
 australian coal is not cheena reserve .
 wumaos fall in now to defend your motherland’s honour !
 why bow down to bogans !
 cheena finally went down on knees and kowtow liao .
 ccp and winnie xjp never should have picked a fight they cannot finish~~   .
 hope australia dont sell them let cheena collapse .
 cheena is that kind of country once chiu help them tide over a disaster .
 instead of gratitude and graciousness .
 they will stabbed chiu back~~ 
 ban la ban more lah
 should have done this earlier .
 in both cases oso will lose face but at least do it earlier then the chinese people wont for nothing suffer loss of electricity .
 tried to mine too many bitcoins invented by foreigner is it ?
 cheena eye red red always want to jump into other people &apos;s money making avenues and then later find ways to kp about others   .
 see la now drop stones on foot haha !
 australia can stand up to cheena .
 u better worry about your reserves if a confrontation breaks out between usa and cheena ,  and they want allies to pick sides
 must be cia black hand .
 a great country like cheena does not need angmo coal lolol .
 on a serious note ,  glad cheena now know a single country does not make the world .
 everytime threaten here and there ,  think other countries need cheena trade alot .
 now they know trade goes both way .
 see next time still will threaten and ban anot
 take a rock and whack cina &apos;s own feet
 if sinkieland dont like cheena why invest so much there ?
 ccp damn thick skin .
 did the article or my reply state singapore ?
 why ban first place .
 ccp needs to learn to chill .
 its not like we wouldnt accept them as betas .
 just look at youtube .
 time to stop communism .
 stop taiwan mongering
 this is how the world works; .
 just cos u r a prince doesnt mean bigger powers will give u face ,  unless your interest aligns with their interest
 j&t ,  jiak my package or what ?
 tracking shows delivered but i didnt receive anything .
 i bought from shopee yesterday all delivering by ninja van .
 i update mine later ,  my shopee parcel oso use ninjavan .
 mine oso delayed .
 pick on on 2nd may 
 i ask them dont come near me  ,  they just throw inside my opened door  .
 my lazada parcel has been picked up by the ninjas .
 let &apos;s see how it goes lol and if can be received by sat .
 my order from shopee on the way since 6am lol .
 reached ninja van on 28th apr .
 have no idea if i will receive it today .
 moi order recently all j&t .
 speedpost delivery oso change to simplypost .
 dont like ninja van oso .
 they anyhow declare failed delivery one
 my decathlon parcel was not picked up by ninjavan since 16th apr !
 ok my parcel just delivered .
 ok leh no issues ,  ordered 1st may ,  ninja van picked up 2nd may ,  3rd may in warehouse ,  5th may delivered .
 mine more epic  .
 just squeeze in between the gate grills  .
 told the ninja not to ,  still insist to  .
 then run off like a true ninja
 a bit annoyed by this carousell seller .
 bought this item two weeks ago and just delivered by jt .
 doesnt look like jt delay as label seems to suggest that it was from cheena but seller didnt state it &apos;s on po .
 suddenly my parcel is on its way back to the warehouse lol .
 parcel is being processed at ninja van warehouse - ninja van sorting facility .
 parcel is on its way .
 parcel is being processed at ninja van warehouse - singapore .
 parcel still stuck with them since 20th april !
 all deliveries - via ninja van ,  roadbull ,  speedpost etc - to my place have been impeccable in recent years .
 ta-q-bin was good ,  too ,  before they seemingly disappeared off the scene .
 dhl ,  fedex & ups are standard-bearers ,  as usual .
 many years ago ,  had to put up with the ninja singpost (non-)deliveries ,  resulting in having to pick up the items from the post office branch .
 realized their expected delivery dates ,  they give one week buffer one .
 most of my lazada buys are minimally 100 + one leh so i oso dont find them super cheap ,  sometimes even close to 1k .
 if thats the case they should prioritize my goodies 
 sellers have pushed back 1 week on their selling platform during cb period
 oredi like almost 20 years those cecas and pinoise using fake and mill degress earn until some pr buy hdb song song gao jurong then mom realize the need to clamp down ?
 if local do such thing got so slow take action anot ?
 sinkie pwn sinkie is real .
 unaccredited mean teaching and paper no standard one .
 any how do still can 1st class .
 cos no sop and no one checking
 while sinkie still have to go through strict streaming and filtering .
 ceca and other ftrash come here with dubious qualification chao chao 66k per month like ramesh uptron .
 mom is a loose pu$$y to lee ching .
 forge cert is one makes a fake cert with fake results on school they didnt attend or school dont exist .
 diploma/degree mill is a business specialising in printing cert ,  makes a fake cert with fake results on school they didnt attend or school dont exist .
 then it &apos;s not fake ,  it unaccredited  .
 so means if want to forge must get a specialist to forge
 how is that fake degree ?
 ok fake degree but not forge .
 both equally bad
 both are equally bad but why mom appears to create a distinction between both ,  as if making an excuse for their incompetency .
 chiu come to changi business park chiu understand  .
 their cert all from dubious degree and all distinction grades  .
 and what makes me super angry is that i solving problems for them which they using degree mill which i suspect earning 7k-18k .
 chiu come take my job chiu understand what is degree mill
 i understand your view on degree mill ,  fake qualifications .
 it &apos;s really bad that they dont have the legit quality to hold that position and yet still getting paid loads for it .
 to dilute the pool and viola ,  u get to lowball and depress wages
 i solved many problems for ceca directors / manager  .
 can chiu believe it i just graduated a few months and i solving problems for them
 the first post article ought to gain some traction and create awareness esp the media .
 knn sibei power .
 really bo wei gong
 there are fake ministers and non accredited minsters i guess .
 and i believe they &apos;re taking credit for all your effort .
 aiyah in exchange for someone gambling in ceca land ,  they get to export lots of dodgy  &apos;talent &apos; over freely
 but when they came out with that chart  .
 and later oso no vote swing .
 means we can accept degree mill ?
 like almost everywhere oso cannot ,  worst case play inside toilet can boh ?
 now i oni like those mention cooking ,  hiking ,  travelling .
 a bit bui bui but i ok la the smile not bad mah .
 can eat nice food together  .
 i don’t know i keep getting catholics  ,  christian  ,  post graduate degree is what ?
 i oni got degree leh  .
 then got vegetarian  ,  play skateboard walan i 35 years old how play skateboard later i go a&e after a fall .
 maybe ah gui need leave edmw ?
 see u pcw ,  multiple of your threads all on one page whenever i log in be it morning or night .
 i think chiu need a  life outside edmw
 i am not gonna try again ,  satisfied with my answers oredi 
 u see a couple love oni will last a short while .
 afterwards is constant bickering ,  lower or no sex drive ,  stay oni cos of house and kids ,  need to worry about kids future etc .
 why make yourself suffer ?
 just stay single ,  buy a bachelor pad and play the dating game enough to enjoy life .
 i think the idea here is to be truthful to yourself .
 do chiu really enjoy cooking ,  hiking and travelling ?
 if chiu convince yourself that those are things that chiu truly love and not keywords that might bait the girls ,  then chiu got something to work with .
 maybe christian girls are more on these dating apps lor .
 i have seen fair share of free-thinker and buddhist in cmb/tinder .
 post-graduate means they still studying more after their degree .
 can be masters or phd .
 my opinion on vegetarian is that i salute their resolve for being a vegetarian but if i am looking for a potential date/partner ,  i really cannot settle someone that might feel awkward or uncomfortable if i go around looking for meat to eat .
 this is really black and white .
 saying chiu can deal with mock meat is like injecting copium and say soy is meat ,  cannot sustain pass the honeymoon period .
 i think most ladies can agree to disagree that their partners no need to share the same hobby .
 it will be cool to have similar hobbies but more often than not chiu probably have hobbies that the girl cannot indulge ,  vice versa .
 both me and my friends experienced break up due to religion differences before really a huge hurdle to overcome .
 the rest is not so bad maybe diet on vegetarian might be another consideration  .
 the rest should be ok  .
 earn $ more important to me than take master or phd cos not cheap and don’t really know what to focus on to study .
 personally  ,  too high standard may be a bit frightening for me especially master and phd students .
 don’t really like the feeling of being controlled and manipulated by ladies  .
 sad to hear about the breakup .
 have chiu learn anything from it ?
 was the constant clash or partner insisting that chiu go along with their religion that made the break ?
 eventually chiu will see if that is your dealbreaker and filter girls better lor .
 girls going for phd or masters can oso be like part of the job requirement or some dunno if want to work after they got their degree so they just continue with the studies .
 at no point will they become higher standard then control their partner .
 most of those post graduate student will be mugging hard for their thesis instead of thinking how to control their date   .
 just approach them with an open mind .
 they might be good in their field of study but chiu should have life experiences that they might not have .
 chiu can just slowly trickle down the stories(try not to dua pow) and get them hook lor .
 how is this a bad thing ?
 tbh its not about looks .
 its about feeling comfortable when u r with the person .
 having lotsa stuffs to chat and most imptly must click .
 and looks is subjective lor .
 one may find guy a handsome but another may find guy a barely ok .
 i would have to agree that being obese is definitely not really acceptable for most .
 weight is something that u can work on so if u want to look good then u have to work for it .
 no pain no gain .
 thats why if u want a marriage to work out ,  both parties must put in the effort .
 if oni one party is the one that keeps giving and the other takes everything for granted ,  one day the marriage is likely to break down .
 i dont think they will restrict your diet ,  just respect theirs .
 bring her to eat elemen ,  herbivore or let her bring chiu hunt for food oso quite refreshing .
 if she fell in love with chiu ,  your rod will be the oni piece of meat she will taste .
 dont get me wrong ,  im not trying to bash the older generation .
 far from it in fact .
 but i seriously feel youre out of touch with the thinking and mindset of the younger gen .
 looks is important ,  full stop  .
 but like i said in my earlier post it &apos;s not across the board for all gerls ,  tho a good portion of them
 the pill concept is just rubbish .
 life is much more than finding a partner ,  being in a relationship ,  starting family etc .
 chu are not animals ,  procreation is not the end goal .
 a man &apos;s primary goal is to live a purposeful life .
 that life can take any form but it must give meaning to him .
 the question he needs to ask is did he live a meaningful life .
 all other things are secondary ,  even a zhabor .
 thats why zhabors oni join a man on a journey and along for the ride .
 can throw them out of the car anytime .
 chiu remember him but do chiu remember me bro  ?
 i remember chiu ,  chiu had an en-bloc and chiu are with privilege banking ,  right  ?
 yes i agree with chiu .
 i think looks are inportant .
 and i am not even part of the younger generation .
 given rk as an example ,  even if she has good character ,  can cook well ,  can take care of children etc etc ,  chiu name it ,  she got it .
 but with her looks and size ,  i’ll pass .
 i’ll rather stay single .
 having a life here dont mean no life outside mah 
 my daughter belongs to the younger generation .
 she showed me the photo of the guy she had a crush on and that guy to me is not handsome lor .
 let &apos;s get that out of the way .
 the younger the girl ,  the more looks matter .
 however ,  in general ,  looks matter less to women than to men .
 think about it .
 why do guys and girls get together ?
 to bang and have babies .
 your woman is supposed to carry your baby for 9 months .
 what she brings to the table is her body .
 chiu have to take care of her .
 physical characteristics like looks and height help .
 but not alot .
 chiu may not get with a girl today to get a baby ,  but this is our genetic programming that drives us .
 so for guys ,  looks are 90% .
 chiu assess her overall physical quality .
 the rest are ,  are there any deal breakers: wrong religion ,  druggie ,  psycho killer ,  etc .
 most other things guys can deal .
 does she have big tits ?
 most guys are visually oriented .
 for girls ,  look ,  money ,  personality ,  all come into play .
 there &apos;s no point in having a tall ,  handsome guy if he cant put food on her table in her third trimester .
 guys need to fulfil a range of threshold conditions .
 and cos women need to assess guys and do it fast ,  they rely alot on feelings .
 she depends on what a guy can make her feel .
 which is why confidence and social skills ,  the ability to lead ,  to have presence ,  and make a lady comfortable ,  trump looks most of the time .
 many of chiu dont see this cos ,  to be frank ,  your social skills are not very good .
 which is why chiu are here .
 looks are obvious ,  things like confidence and social savvy less so .
 chiu may not even be able to recognize it .
 so the first step to getting women is to understand them .
 and to understand women chiu need to understand people .
 it &apos;s a long road ,  but is it worth it ?
 what u did that scare people away ?
 are u aware of it ?
 fund more cows to produce dung n urine .
 tiffany for the face  .

 i almost bought their wireless gaming headsets .
 read the review and it seems not so good .
 sony still seems to be quite decent on this area
 xm4 it is the king
 sibei rich me no noise cancel oni noise reduce znt
 contemplated the bo but they are expensive .
 settled for sennheiser instead and regret .
 thought of the buds especially at one stage the newest ones were dumped at 150 plus .
 see what the sonys sound like
 actually creative isnt bad for gaming and 3d effects and watching tv with surround sound .
 quite good for the price point  .
 but sony still beats it .
 sony is more expensive
 have the xm3 ,  very tempted to buy the xm4 .
 the sound is very balanced and well rounded .
 bass is good too for something so small .
 thought about that but kinda leychey .
 im happy with my xm2 headphone on flights .
 so unless song can give a perfect reason to upgrade ,  im sticking to the headphone
 chiu can use the equaliser function to tweak to heavier bass too
   i chengsim after the driver saga .
 their stuff doesnt necessarily last so use it to the max in a rough way cos it &apos;ll have to be tossed away sooner or later
 i got the sennheiser momentum 3s .
 after the update with the high end sound tuning ,  they sound really really good
 yes b&os are very expensive and their new beoplay eq is even more expensive ,  but first to have anc .
 now you’ve learnt about sennheisers so avoid them in your next purchase .
 buds family seriously just for samsung phones and i rotate it with my xm4 .
 the xm4 oredi sounds so good on spotify playing at oni 320kbps ,  chiu pair it with tidal hifi and i’m sure you’ll get blown away .
 the sony 1000xm4 has a battery life of 36-38 hours and sound quality is farking good .
 im using it so i highly recommend it !
 sennheiser oni their mid-tier onwards hd series headphones can buy .
 their tws ,  iems ,  those gaming sets ,  those entry level hd series ,  all cmi
 after i got burned by 1 and 2 ,  wont buy 3 even if its $50 .
 & yes   ,  i tuned and adjusted the sound and it sounds better than with no adjustments but still lose to the sonys
 does bud really sounds better with samsung ?
 think about your use cases .
 i’ve tried sony bose and apple .
 as much as i don’t want to get tied to apples ecosystem i’ve to say apple airpods pro is great .
 both the buds and the case are small and great for wearing on planes and leaning against the window to rest .
 the transparency mode is brilliant for zoom calls .
 if you’ve apple devices the connections and auto switch between devices are done really well .
 how to rough up a sound card .
 to lock up drivers and force people to buy a new sound card .
 sorry its too much to accept
 i tuned the sony 3 to the best sound quality and i need to bring the case out .
 if not it &apos;ll last 1 hour plus and it &apos;ll hit low battery
 surprisingly most reviews state that the sennheisers sound better .
 this is a first .
 from what i read ,  no matter how u tune the sonys ,  the bass still lose sennheiser
 how come never mention icu or isolation occupancy rate as one of the metric
 >we want to get there with as few casualties as possible ,  &apos; mr lee said .
 he meant as long not the causalities not the elite
 sinkies are kind and forgiving .
 come 2025 with $600 thrown in their faces with some noble reasons ,  sinkies will easily forgive n forget 
 when daily numbers started soaring ,   they told us that the daily number of new cases is not important .
 it &apos;s the severe cases ,  icu and deaths that are important .
 now that the numbers of severe cases  ,  icu and deaths are increasing ,   they say to focus on the weekly (7days) number of cases !
 in other words if any data looks bad  ,  we should ignore it and look at other data  ?
 does it include those recovering at home ?
 focus on whether color healthy or not can oredi la  
 no one is asking them to lock down forever .
 is your task force incompetency that fail to improve the situation .
 if your task force are decisive and competent enough it will not become this bad .
 now is getting worse and all chiu said is open up .
 originally prepared 100 icu beds for covid .
  now oredi ~ 150% taken
 just let the pap ministers rip
 if they hadn &apos;t been so obstinate ,   too proud to turn around when they first received projections of a rapid surge in numbers  ,  we wouldnt be getting such numbers  .
 nobody told them that  &apos;a stitch in time saves 9 &apos; .
 thats not referring to sewing oni hor guys !
 take action early ,   or else it will get much worse ,   and harder to solve
 again ,  need to include this be it relevant or not .
 applying the  &apos;right &apos; maths
 chiu forgot - covid is like getting influenza (provided chiu dont die from it)
 i rly cannot see how things are gonna improve under this group of good for nothings .
 makes me sad really
 aiyo ,  why these idiots keep thinking citizens want a lockdown ?
 they really hopeless
 so ,  cannot do this ,  but oso cannot do that .
 then pay chiu so much to do what ?
 decisiveness is the hallmark of great leadership which chiu are clearly lacking and people are dying unnecessarily as a result .
 even the 3 ladies ,  carrie lam ,  engrish tsai ,  and your wife have more iron in them than chiu .
 world highest paid jiak liao bee ever .
 what is your greatest fear for singapore ?
 i think a leadership and a people that have forgotten ,  that have lost their bearings and do not understand the constraints that we face .
 small base; highly ,  technically organised; very competent people; complete international confidence; and an ability to engage the big boys .
 chiu lose those ,  and you’re down .
 and chiu can go down very rapidly…    
 rip is a wrong choice of words .
 especially when sinkies are upset about the daily covid death rate .
 old king coal was a merry old soul and a merry old soul was he … .
 if chiu like to talk about singapore trade with cheena or prince .
 chiu can start a thread and ask your khaki join in .
 tell them no stock liao .
 or sell at double the price .
 big is oso a form vulnerable .
 thats why king david will the goliath .
 oso us oso kerna 2 birds crash into building 20 years ago .
 winnie is full of poo
 i think they too chill until no choice have to suck thumb and buy coal from aussie liao cause no heating available
 bend over just for some coal .
 so cheena allow more australian wine to import in ?
 this will set off a-bomb on weibo shattering billion of hearts .
 @orwell99 go go go xi &apos;s cheena blink first !
 better than some so call  &apos;superpower &apos; that cant even build decent toilets for their citizens .
 this not consider kowtow yet la ,  they still havent resume import yet .
 i oso hope aussie stop selling to them .
 in fact with a major market cut off to them now ,  aussie should take the opportunity to reduce their investments in coal mining and start focusing on renewable energy and rare earth minerals .
 cheena reduce demand then aus should cut supply lor .
 so at old price or new price ?
 shoud not sell them since they keep kachiao taiwan everyday .
 why tiongcock need to bow down to chao angmo and buy their coal !
 no power then no power lor .
 cannot use candle like the below meh ?
 burn liao can + 100 social credit !
 the facts are that tiongs rely heavily on angmo for exports and jobs .
 if all the angmo companies and the so called  &apos;evil &apos; koreans and japanese companies pull out .
 the tiongs can prepare to eat grass and tree barks .
 chiu think cheena alone can provide jobs for nearly 1 .
 5 billion people ?
 they work as what ?
 oso tiong heavily depend on angmo country be it from usa ,  russia ,  australia and so on food ,  raw materials and other goods .
 thats why despite all the hate from cheena ,  chiu dont see them chasing the angmo out of cheena .
 cos their economy will collapse and the tiongs will starve if they do such thing .
 thats the hard truth .
 paging for prc ibs !
 wheres flame2k and bozopeta
 chiu don’t have to like a country to want to make money from them .
 its business ,  nothing personal .
 cheena got rob people ?
 cheena got pay money ,  hater diam diam ,  nothing oso post a cb thread to anti cheena ,  go see doctor ,  see got any mental issues .
 march 2019 article
 basically culling jlb jobs .
 waraoeh mar 2019 article
 post 2 year old article for what
 that time covid still in wuhan lab
 basically taken over by fw ,  ft pmets .
 started long time wen floodgates opens for up population to current 5 .
 now kena get marginalized .
 report so late .
 any idea how i can change / upgrade hdd and reinstall windows and all the dell drivers  ?
 i saw on fb a group of them sorting parcels is social distancing breakers .
 then friend try to defend them  .
 lanjiao ninja van .
 slow slow slow
 non cb time is 2 days ,  now cb is 4 days ,  im fine .
 my last order is 1st may ,  3rd may picked up ,  4th may brought back to sorting hub .
 until now 6th no further updates .
 4 days liao this time .
 sigh spoil my trust in them .
 ninjavan slow deliver and slow updates on the status .
 fat ninja getting slower .
 dont ever order anything from decathlon online now !
 they &apos;ll anyhow cancel n refund after u order 1 week later ,  bloody wasting time .
 extremely efficient wor .
 my colleague said est .
 monday deliver when person picked up on fri afternoon .
 then the documents reached me on friday night - delivery man called if he can deliver earlier .
 ibs lip lai liao lol
 yes ,  same experience .
 i was at home yet no call no knock on door just left slip and i waited for them .
 now order things must ask them is it ninjavan before paying .
 very sad yesterday my good delivered by ninja van come in terok condition
 ok ,  2 parcels now at sorting hub eta delivery today(unlikely ah) till 11 may .
 i got one more parcel ordered 2 days ago from amazon singapore oso using ninjavan ,  eta 9th may .
  earlier than eta .
 no leh few days 2 times ninjavan all arrived on time .
 wa how come chiu so lucky .
 they got send chiu sms ninja is visiting  ?
 or was it a suprise visit
 from experience ,  everything from lazada was done either by ninja van ,  or that other wolf simi company .
 service standards same for both ,  cos i got exactly the same experience from both courier companies .
 qoo10 have their own courier service or some other vendor ,  but almost never the above 2 ,  unless its some direct seller delivery .
 somehow it depends on the delivery guys in charge of your area .
 i &apos;ve no issue with singpost ,  ninjavan ,  simplypost for my location .
 the main ninja responsible for my area always wa me way beforehand .
 sometimes if i think a parcel might be coming today ,  i oso wa him and he will check for me .
 actually cj logistics  ,  speed post ,  j&t and ninja are all partners with lazada .
 i got sellers using speed post instead of ninjavan before .
 i really don’t think this covid wave is simple .
 extend until 11th oct .
 then year end exam .
 around 1 month later is dec holiday .
 as long extend default wfh ,  other things want to do what oso fine with me
 i find that window is vulnerable to everyone .
 the covid mess and wave is really fierce this time round .
 everyday people die ,  and is really sad and depressing .
 if the g cares about our wellbeing ,  they should have oredi done something instead of pushing ahead .
 should lockdown and restrict movement so people dont crowd around .
 i hope they lurking and find this thread .
 i think hbl should extend for schools .
 the covid wave has gone out of control .
 think will zhun zhun let them do exams first then holidays liao .
 most probably  .
 once the school finish exam ,  they will let the kids hbl  .
 then follow by holidays .
 they wont stop  .
 until one of them is affected .
 or the spread is viral among their social circles .
 extend 1 more week till 15 oct ,  then it’s psle marking week which is another hbl .
 after seeing how they execute hbl ,  i understand why they were so reluctant to push it previously .
 yesterday the teacher talked for less than 10 minutes then ended .
 rest of the days ,  the child is on their own doing sls .
 today the teacher went through an assignment for less than 40 min then log out .
 most students are oredi bad in chinese and there is no chinese lesson at all .
 exam is in less than a month ,  the ones at my house can barely write a coherent sentence ,  dont mention compo .
 comprehension oso quite jialat .
 but i still support not going to school to keep them safe .
 i feel they can learn more from me than hbl .
 let those jlb teachers holiday for next 3 months .
 extraordinary times needs extraordinary measures .
 for this year ,   .
 just auto promote every kid or .
 let every kid repeat the year lor .
 october 31st last paper .
 safety comes first .
 chiu don’t initiate wfh 50% and insist 100% return for the teachers and pupils .
 this is plain silly and counter the effort of covid control .
 but to be fair ,  most of the children got covid from their family members .
 teachers are family members of other children .
 this wave is not simple .
 what do chiu think the mtf should do ?
 if let this mess fester ,  our economy oso tank ,  tourist oso wont come .
 might as well do something drastic to lower the number first .
 always preempt us with high number instead of doing something to keep number low .
 singapore has to take the bitter pill ,  revert to circuit breaker cb2 .
 0 and lock down .
  economy tank ,  everything will be impacted but we can always have a chance to recalibrate and re-chart the direction after the storm .
 the current regime is too draggy ,  too much pain points and continuously affecting the under privilege ones .
  as much as i agree the lockdown will affect most (if not all) sinkie and residents but it should cast away all the doubts and singapore will be better position ,  align and have the ability to recalibrate itself soonest possible when the variables are being clean up .
 it is painful ,  and will have alot of sacrifices but it is inevitable .
 omg eunji in the house
 moi still listen to rain once in awhile .
 hear say ,  older fermented kimchee will have an acquired taste
 jav version of snsd ?
 jieun is absolutely adorable in hyori b&b .
 in the show she seems a bit slow and clumsy but that is where her charm shines through .
 i cant get enough of her .
 lol you &apos;re just stating the obvious .
 say like never say
 anyways he face really behsai .
 muscle for fug use .
 the amdl still tag #interracial like so proud and flamboyant liddat .
 frankly speaking in all honesty a proper decent #amwf #interracial would be like moi ,  see my dp on edmw the pics are moi gfs ,  engrish and scottish ,  they generally ignore asians but gimme chance cos moi sinkie chinese .
 and they seen crazy rich asians
 im trying to subtlety hint that amdl actually find sinkies repulsive ,  just that they dream of catching a big fish .
 it &apos;s not true love 
 amdl oni care about $$$
 spoiler: not for chewren !
 dog cannot change eat shiat
 they claim kidnappers but without an actual open court ,  no one is able to know for sure .
 yup ,  im not arguing that it takes more than looks to attract women .
 just stating the fact that looks do matter (be it men or women) .
 people should stop saying otherwise .
 anyway ,  agree to a large extend of your comments .
 yes ,  i remember chiu .
 your nick is my favourite game .
 chiu are that rich single guy
 what is your deck ?
 thanks for remembering .
 i am single ,  but not rich .
 just doing ok *laughs*
 nobody says looks are not important .
 we are saying it is not all encompassing .
 it oso depends on the ladies age .
 young xmm want ham .
 as they age and mature ,  they look for other attributes .
 cos they know the baggage that comes with dating a yantao
 stopped playing a while .
 my clan kicked me out .
 i was the clan chief !
 now playing mobile legends .
 saw your bank statement .
  chiu are doing far better than ok if i recall 
 i know if i want to find a perfect waifu like remember mm  ,  it will be in isekai  
 one argument i find flawed is bbfa tries to approximate a ladies views using his own lens .
 as chiu age ,  chiu will discover men are from mars and women from venus .
 both are built differently .
 men fall in love with their eyes .
 women fall in love with their ears .
 if chiu know how to woo a lady with words ,  she will be smitten .
 for guys ,  from 16 to 90 y .
 dont mind me ask ,  how old is your daughter ?
 i have 2 teenage daughters .
 they are not allowed to have crushes 
 wa mly uncle how come so strict with your daughters ?
 they have crush they dont tell u how u know ?
 i am fine with them having crushes cos i myself during teenage yrs oso have crushes .
 as long as dont start dating .
 i am not worried for her cos she is sensible enuff .
 and the fact that she tells me all these stuffs is good   by the way she is 15 liow .
 cos he knows just how dangerous smoove guys can be 
 last time girls like andy lau nowadays girls like jimin ,  quite different tastes le .
 but sometimes u pull too tightly the string  will break .
 i feel that its better to become “friends” with your child so that they will tell u everything  
 like i like my min ho oppa ?
  but my daughter dont like kpop guys leh .
 i think every father who has had some dating experience will be strict with his daughter/s .
 we know how young boys with raging testosterones operate  
 to be fair ,  looks are a door opener .
 but after that chiu still must deliver the goods .
 anyway ,  if chiu cant get in through the door can always find a window haha .
 moi like hayoung .
 but if they crushing on their classmates ,  the guys shouldn &apos;t be that smooth mah .
 just teach them how to filter guys can liao .
 give some hope to the older guys in the future to chase  
 yes ,  its good daughters confide in their moms .
 dads have a different role .
 my daughters are 16 and 17 .
 both from girls school .
 so no bgr issues .
 eldest is now jc .
 mixed gender now .
 so i am eyeballing her .
 my role is to shoot the guy that show interest in her 
 i like the sound from galaxy buds .
 sennheiser vomit inducing  .
 sony sounds better .
 all the details are there .
 worse is if chiu listen intently ,  you &apos;ll realise the song have details the sony can produce but sennheiser ?
 heng i use angmo apple airpod
 i’ve tried it on my iphone before and sounds just about ‘regular’ ,  and chiu oso won’t get the full features compared to being paired with a samsung .
 but that’s how it sounds to my ears .
 i don’t deny that ,  airpods have the best transparency mode ,  almost as clear as if chiu don’t put on any earphones .
 i got xm4 and qc .
 if chiu prefer stronger bass ,  then qc .
 oh i didnt see the topic properly .
 i was talking about the headphones .
 what time singapore officially start ?
 thats your opinion .
 i think the senheissers sound better slighly but lose out in the other aspects
 galaxy buds 2 - harman tuning and it is comfy
 no ,  they sound the same .
 just extra features will be available if chiu use samsung phones with the buds .
 bose has overbloated bass .
 standard harman curve tuning ,  which tends to appeal to regular consumers .
 not surprise chiu will like it .
 i bought it at $400  on carousell a year ago though
 if chiu are talking about the headphones ,  xm4 is shit .
 overbloated bass ,  bleeds all over the place .
 reminds me of beats by dr dre ,  classic shit standard .
 changes the ear cups .
 dekoni not bad .
 25% off is good deal leh
 using xm4 for a year and counting…haven’t changed the pad yet .
 but again ,  i wear it average of 2h or lesser daily 
 xm3 was damn overrated .
 xm4 i doubt any diff .
 sound quality wise sennheiser is better than sony .
 not just personal opinion ,  those audiophiles have run tests and sennheiser comes out top .
 then again ,  personal taste is most important when it comes to sound .
  buy what chiu like .
  i find sony has too “tinny” a sound ,  like overly metallic and when listening to jazz or pop music ,  not full enough .
  it has to fill my auditory senses ,  like being surrounded by the instruments .
 this one very true .
 is this treatment standardized with other countries ?
 make sure when u left dont leave ans and traces of ans to them .
 sinkies will still subscribe to the standard singapore route cos of their faith in local unis despite all the evidence pointing otherwise .
 decades of indoctrination makes the educated stupid .
 in uk/cananda all these are deemed as fake degrees
 u think the intent of ceca is to boost local talent pool ?
 it is just to exchange for rights to gamble in india .
 thats why the indians come here and take short nus ntu sure pass certification courses to buff up and cover their degree mill certs .
 after that the angmo countries will kena snooked .
 all the cecas in singapore are safe !
 if chiu are 61% ,  chiu got what chiu wanted .
 bro i really very angry  .
 sometimes i told them ,  seriously be useful in life ,  degree mill nvm ,  go learn and work hard .
 they seems like don’t care me and continue going for their afternoon high tea .
 but if i register my house as a school ,  can i print out  degrees from my home printer and sell it for $5k ?
 however this issue everywhere in the world .
 yes thats what mom is saying
 chiu go india and setup maybe still gotch chance .
 singapore setup chiu will get caught fined and jailed soon .
 degree mill is similarly bad  .
 i don’t want to write long story  .
 chiu come work with them chiu understand  .
 got one time i was helping them to write a while loop
 the issue is we dont have a central authority to validate these degrees ,  mom/moe just pass the buck to employers
 oni pap ministers are the true arbiter of truth .
 they say fake then is fake ok .
 indian can oso become malay .
 as long as pap allows it .
 next time sinkpore gahmen ask u all to welcome all of them with open arms and legs ,  u all jolly well better show this facial expression .
 retarded flip flop policies .
 cannot full locked means money is more important than people live .
 who are the stupid people voted this people in .
 why he talks without adding value ?
 please take your whole party n disappear
 1)  lock down - my take is lock down is to lower cases and to try new strategies .
  not merely lock down to let cases fall then unlock .
  this will be an endless loop .
 2) have a new place for covid .
  any cases with covid and are stable admit straight to expo or some other facility like army camps .
 i was thinking of nyp cos i heard many years ago nyp is actually designed as a hospital in the sense that the equipment there are actually functioning and not  &apos;merely training equipment for nurses but are actually operationally ready .
  &apos;  plus it is centralised .
  this will actually reduce the load in the hospitals .
  actually isolation facilities can be like tekong .
  nyp is more for ease of access by ambulances .
 3)  yes  i agree .
  but the fixation on mrna vaccination is troubling .
   but we ate moving in the right steps .
 chiu saved lives to call on everything ,  without people we are just nothing .
 these fools really not scared of karma hor ?
 haha i was shocked when i saw the thread title too .
 wow what a thing to say
 got talk like never talk
 what new information did he provide ?
 more like parroting what the mmtf said .
 loong ,  your health minister of death thinks otherwise .
 how did the r fall so much ?
 no counting of art cases ?
 we are stuck ,  we don’t know what to do ,  but we oso cannot do nothing ,  so we have to do something
 it is mission fail for the covid task force and pm lee !
 yesterday ,  it was a pain to watch and listen to lw n ong give update and oso answer press queries !
 these bunch of clowns are such incompetent leaders !
 u will notice they emphasised fearing and working not to stress the medical team further !
 then how can opening travel to india and malaysia makes sense ?
 u will oso notice that the media who ask questions did not question the stupidity of existing policies !
 a family of 4 cannot eat out together but it is ok for people to take sbs and mrt ?
  what logic is this ?
 why the reporters did not ask this ?
 now using carrot and stick approach liao .
 it has oni got worse when they restrict locals due to raising number but still allow imports in .
 now make everything’s look like local being discriminated ,  at least  for me .
 cause local media are… .
  not given 160 ranking for nothing
 what lhl said is definitely true .
 not sure why alot of people with low intellect cannot comprehend this .
 we are such a small country that unlike huge country like cheena that can easily survive just with their own population .
 we are treading down the path of downfall if we choose to continue to lockdown .
 ps : his oni wrong doing is to stop all meet the people session .
 this shows that while the elites are not ready to embrace death if it knocks on their doors .
 all others have to be force to accept it .
 we need their money
 hello ,  chiu aussie ?
 chiu love australia so much ,  go there on vacation and see people &apos;s reactions of chiu ?
 see the results later .
 this is damn xiasuay leh .
 bro xi should round up and execute those who touch the coal .
 if millions have to die in a -20 degree winters so be it .
 faster show his iron !
 wa xi dada eats back his words .
 no one here talking about how great ozland is .
 but alot of them are laughing at cheena .
 so no need divert .
 oni 1 superpower .
 still far away .
 chiu so sensitive ?
 laughing at others make chiu better ?
 loser mentality ,  chiu cannot help these type people .
 which country uses most renewable energy and has more high speed rail ?
 blink first liao worrr  .
 many triggered people here
 im just an ordinary peasant in singapore .
  nothing worthy to mention ,  just another sinkie who is struggling for a living .
 dunno leh for now is 2 wks
 on a serious note ,  if mm lee kuan yew has the iron in him to ground sia to fence off the riots from the pilots in 80s ,  i believe he would take the bitter pill to ground singapore again against the covid wave .
 as i have had mentioned ,  the grounding will help singapore ,  sinkie and residents to reorientate ourselves ,  realigned to the big environment ,  attuning and acclimate ourselves better to the fluid situation that this covid renders .
 it is really taking alot of gut and grit but i believe singapore and sinkie will respond to that call to combat covid .
  afterall ,  this is really a matter of life and death .
 will this year exam be cancelled and be replaced by  &apos;assignments &apos; results &apos;  ?
 liddat then this year will have lesser superboys and supergirls in hdb estates .
 the situation certainly looks negative and pessimistic .
  hope the politicians make a sensible decision .
 we have a choice - economy or life .
 live with covid
 mm failed us by letting his son  be his successor .
 so beta how to lead a country ?
 will diwali celebration be allowed this year ?
 truly opening up during dec and nearer cny will be the perfect way for positive cases and deaths to shoot up .
 u education minster ?
 at the rate of infection as well as under the blindship from oyk ,  i hope we do not witnessing >5000 cases daily before the school starts .
 it &apos;s very worrying .
 there &apos;s nothing wrong with hbl what .
 wait for review after 2 weeks
 bumping up this thread in conjunction to some hwz members concern over the psle rubbish .
 bumping up this thread to create awareness and the need to review hbl schedule and period .
 simi vaccinate or regular test .
 then stop today ah taxi ?
 yes ,  oredi stopped last weekend .
 i am waiting for cdg reply on my sinopharm subscription but no reply yet .
 seems like today will tio toto .
 to see bw shushu making sense in edmw
 tertiary schools and institution (vaccinated population) have oredi moved and shifted to online learning till 22 oct in view of uncontrollable covid situation .
 so ,  will moe respond to the above and extend the hbl for the primary and secondary schools ?
 the covid situation has spiral out of control and we no longer can afford a laid back attitude handling this covid when we are oredi suffering losing the elderly lives due to an incompetency of the ministry and minister who bets on the script .
 a hard decision is needed !
 2400+ cases daily and it could be rising .
 moe has any plan or just wait ,  and stay reactive to see a spike in schools before the long awaited school holiday ?
 dont be stupid ,  i went there more then u go jb and never got strange reactions .
 maybe u have a crooked nose thats why .
 bozo banned liao ,  idiosyncracy oso apprently
 why chiu so triggered ?
 tiongs got no spine in reality .
 always using propaganda to hide their inferiority complex .
 thats why historically always losing to smaller countries or defeated despite having large advantages .
 he is chao ahtiong thats why !
 this is maximum xia sway
 so ,  gahment giving more rebates for companies to hire fws
 dont really understand y giv rebates .
 alrdy subsidies them so much till giving the workers free quarantine and medical for covid related .
 we should allow weak companies to fail ,  and not intervening so much
 so are the new btos going to have inferior quality ?
 less skill needed to build
 after all the kpkb ,  now then they realised the protection money is making people very unhappy .
 so now more construction sector bosses can huat more and buy more cars and properties ?
 increase pay oso bangla wont wanna come .
 who want  to stay in dorm and work site 365 days a year
 sinkies in construction ,  marine and process sectors will get extra bonus ?
 since less workers ,  means their work-load will increase ,  right ?
 or oni the bosses get benefit ?
 god knows how they process the parcels oso .
 2 parcels arrived after the next day after pick up from merchant .
 while one parcel went mia for the past 1 week +++  .
 question cs how come not first in first out ,  answer was they unable to handle the load (bloody template copy & paste) ?
 ask how their process flow tell me otherwise .
 singapore and oso watsons online ,  they &apos;ve delivered to me before eta .
 was very surprised during the first delivery from each ,  but after that dont monitor anymore; just wait for ninja &apos;s sms .
 my item yesterday 12pm+ picked up by ninjavan from seller .
 until now havent reached distribution centre  ?
 the driver sleeping or what ?
 singapore got so big  ?
 my parcel was supposed to be delivered on 4may .
 instead it was delivered on 1may ,  a public holiday .
 i think amazon singapore have some special agreement or paid extra to ninjavan for delivery .
 normally pickup - sorting hub will take 1 day on a good day .
 current situation 2-3days i guess .
 fedex ,  dhl or ups no do local delivery for local businesses  ?
 honestly i would pay some delivery fee (not exorbitant) for next business day delivery .
 priority probably given to big branding merchants .
 if not ah next time no need renew delivery contract liao .
 deliveries now overload ,  ninjavan cant even handle and have to outsource a huge part of their parcels to other companies .
 your item may be jumping around different companies see who can take in .
 until they unload at their warehouse ,  unpack all the pallets and scan ,  your status wont update .
 so be patient ,  all deliveries are tremendously busy right now while chiu relak and wait at home .
 that or the driver collecting your item lost it .
 i think they do local for important things like business documents and stuff ,  but it &apos;s up to the merchants to partner whoever offers the best deal i guess .
 sorry we are not paid extra for the holiday ,  we have to do it due to super heavy load .
 if we dont do it we lose that day &apos;s income (which is alot ,  for this period) .
 i bought a dehumidifier from q10 and it was delivered within half a day .
 now the delivery time still valid ?
 mine oredi past that time ,  should i contact them to ask ?
 no need bother ,  they will try to deliver again
 parcel pick-up from sellers got income mah ?
 my delivery from ninjavan so far all ok leh .
 this morning just received the sms that driver delivering ,  before 12 delivered liao .
 so far no issues
 ninja drivers bao ga liao ,  doing both delivery and pickup at the same time
 same just write pick up oni then no updates ,  never say reach or no reach distribution centre .
 dhl fedex all very expensive ,  not don’t have .
 problem is the communication .
 he should be at the forefront of it .
 the day-to-day language from lw and then oyk using different tone .
 must be the civil servants not aligned in each ministry .
 but the leaders are to blame .
 everyone else gonna givein with the investment made by tamasick .
 bloomberg - are chiu a robot ?
 why import 1st place
 too bad people are rip everyday
 lockdown is to actually find strategies for reopening .
 nowhere here or there
 dunno what he is smoking .
 oredi ripping liao .
 this is correct way .
 lhl better than gct .
 gct oni knows how to say: .
 {invest in india} .
 {invest in south africa} .
 {invest in libya}
 means over liao ?
 time to change new one
 she trying her luck with another guy first la .
 if that guy steady steady ~ then she &apos;ll come back to u and say its over  .
 if no guy want her then go back to u as back up plan loh .
 means she bored of u liao .
 once cool off from the emotion ,  dont look back le i guess .
 say i too good to her .
 year end holiday .
 i believe chiu will green hat .
 listen to uncle .
 normally 2 week break or cool down is over liao .
 she will bite and tell u these 2 weeks u never meet or contact oso ok .
 while she go out with other person .
 now i know why she left u
 if not ,  green cap on the menu .
 means she might want to test drive your competitors .
 take time to think and reflect ba .
 sorry ,  i hired her for two weeks .
 forgot to inform chiu .
 sorry for your lost .
 time to look for new one .
 not even competitor .
 its on that fella right .
 she just paiseh tell u
 haiz  says after two week then meetup talk
 means she guilty liao .
 thats y can say this type of thing .
 theres many fish in the ocean ~
 eh i thought one week nia ?
 knn means got a third guy ?
 got freedom liao
 station at the school everyday .
 like my daughter asked me if she could start a youtube channel so i advised her on the do’s and dont’s .
 but tbh la u cannot prevent them from having crushes one cos its all in the brain .
 my daughter knows what she wants so she wont be thinking bout r/s stuffs now .
 cos last time no plastic surgery .
 jimin from bts ?
 why him and not the other 6 ?
 i find bts quite cool .
 investigated them to keep up with my daughters .
 bts stands for things noble .
 good role models .
 i am now their army 
 knn u 23 years old oni scared simi .
 u still have lots of time find gf lah
 ohh classy type .
 moi rikes yoo ah in .
 i go shopping with her too then we oso share some clothes n shoes .
 she likes based on their talents .
 i know she likes ed sheeran ,  alec benjamin ,  jeremy zucker etc .
 actually i myself oso like these singers when she recommended their songs to me .
 i first dated when i was 16 going 17 .
 i think if chiu feel she can date  ,  should remind her about do and don’t  ,  do not neglect studies oso .
 i didn’t tell my parents that i was dating when taking my o levels .
 i still did quite ok with a few distinction however i helped her with her studies so that she can at least get into a poly course .
 i can move on easier as compared to others in the sense that i won’t let relationship affect my daily work  .
 move on totally is hard for me  ,  maybe close to 4-5 years with no contact anymore
 semo guard school ?
 chiu which generation one .
 have to be tactical la .
 employ guerilla warfare .
 gather intel from waifu ,  from her cousin .
 sniff out her insta post .
 she dont allow me to follow .
 so send spies .
 observe her behaviour .
 see she got boil telephone porridge .
 we have been young before what .
 yes good to set rules .
 o hangs out in cafes to study .
 dress till omg .
 why nowadays girls like to show stomach ?
 i ask her ,  is it daddy no money buy more cloth ?
 cloth price go up ah ?
 my rules are clear .
 no bf till uni .
 so i got 2 more years .
 do people on the street think chiu two are sisters ?
 ahaha trendy mama .
 yes ,  ed sheeran is incredibly talented ,  cant say the same for the other two cause i dunno them .
 i thought young girls all go for looks too ,  chiu taught your kids well i must say .
 best advice in this thread .
 else end up bbfa like me at 50 
 ts should think: .
 if end of the day all is going to lose/ break up: .
 would chiu prefer to never have it to begin with so no pain  .
 have it awhile then lose it one day anw ?
 for a moment of satisfaction ,  chiu end up lose more .
 easier for moms .
 i have difficulties transiting tho .
 i just need the guy &apos;s name and phone number .
 he will disappear the next day .
 looks dont matter ,  imo ,  cause chiu can still work on it .
 doesnt matter if chiu are a born a 3/10 ,  its not difficult for guys to clean up ,  work out and dress up ,  chiu can still be a 6/10 after chiu do all that .
  just like men expect women to be alway 100% well manicured at all times ,  why cant women ask for better looking men ?
 attractive men definitely stand better chances in getting women ,  but some women dont like attractive men as they attract alot of trouble .
 first ,  chiu need to get over your fear of falling .
 its ok mly uncle ,  i can wait 2 years then i can give chiu my number ,  my future fil  
 yup i agree with u that if the child is sensible its fine but sec school i think is still too young la .
 she herself feels that uni is a better time to date so as long as she knows what she wants then i just let her be .
 aiyo u very kua zhang leh .
  i follow my girl’s insta account one but since she tells me about her everyday stuffs so i guess i’m not too worried .
 up till now i dont have to set rules for her .
 she doesnt hang out in cafes (except when she goes out during school holidays with frens) and dont wear those cropped tops/shorts revealing butt cheeks cos she thinks its distasteful ?
 she dont ask for latest iphone ,  airpods or whatever too .
 she will oso take a portion of her edusave scholarship every yr to get something for herself and us .
 i oni have to worry for son cos he is not that sensible as my daughter 
 portal to mumbai ?
 but there is error 403 ?
 i’m using edmwer app
 i tried their mx4 overeat headphones before ,  i agree with chiu on the  &apos;tinny &apos; sound .
 sound a little robotic yet very hollow .
 i decided to go for other brands instead .
 wf is earbud not the wh which is headphones ley some of u in this thread .
 got deal can afford just hoot onli .
 started using iem for public transport .
 do u really need anc if u got a good seal ?
 so far found mine mutes mrt sound decently .
 sound preference differs from person to person .
 i love etymotic but tons of audiophiles hate it .
 mainly for flights i think .
 iems with music is better than the headphones with anc .
 but if no music then will need anc
 earbuds are still $309 on brack friday ?
 top up a bit more get the wh1000xm4 better imo .
 wont poke your ears oso .
 cushion jin cumfy .
 want in ear ,  airpods la .
 get older gen one .
 sennheiser for right mix or price and quality .
 airpods pro no horse run
 chiu can consider technics az60 oso .
 got ldac like sony .
 smaller and more comfortable .
 has more pronounced bass and treble than sony but shorter battery life .
 if i’m using crapple ,  is it worth getting samsung buds ?
 i am anti- eco system .
 not interested in getting their earphones .
 sennheiser vs sony .
 chiu own self compare chiu know which is better oredi .
 people will say since site is japanese it &apos;ll of course favor sony
 erm no ,  if chiu listen to the video ,  sennheiser is actually better .
  subjective of course .
 the conclusion says all the good things about sony
 same reason why ps4 is cheaper than ps5
 haha ,  got ears just listen loh .
  top comments praised sennheiser .
 anyway i’m waiting for momentum 3 to hoot .
 how is the technics call quality ?
 the just my voice really filters out background noise effectively and leave my voice clearly to be heard by the other party .
 let me go check the latest price now .
 chiu tio marked liao .
 dont let chiu post to save bandwidth .
 mine ok leh ,  something wrong with chiu  .
 big brother is watching ?
 just keep pressing .
 u never press hard enough .
 *ts furiously pressing  &apos;post &apos; on app to reply to no avail .
 no see this before
 i miss last time lky take on reporters live .
 if this issue is taken on live by edmwers .
 i think no face sia
 cb dont ask me to clear all the tzechar dishes .
 it will be damn ridiculous i got to clear so many plates .
 and dont ask limpeh to carry the whole steamboat back .
 she has the stupidest ideas in pap right now .
 cant think of anyone worse .
 used to compare her with lee bee hwa .
 now she &apos;s unbeatable oredi .
 no one till date can answer my hot claypot question
 must thank the sinkies who voted her in
 now they force tzechar and steamboat to employ extra staff .
 increasing their cost .
 ama how come no one ask her why she is so farking retarded
 claypot u must clear loh .
 thats why i believe claypot will be hit hardest .
 next time go to eat out must bring along rule book ( must download updates first) .
 we have more and more stupid rules with exceptions and exclusions that chiu may not know about
 retarded auntie come out with law .
 waste taxpayer &apos;s money .
 what an oxymoron answer .
  &apos;dedicated staff who will clear table .
 we will take a pragmatic approach .
 hawker centers oso hire dedicated staff who clear tables what .
 hawkers are charged for it ,  patrons are paying for it in their food prices .
 so why oni hawkers centres it is a do or die approach ?
 i support this new law .
 fine every single diner until nobody dare to dine at coffeeshop .
 let everywhere close down 
 who still vote for her better go check his brain .
 what if i returned the claypot and accidentally break it ,  will i need to pay ?
 should be her parting gift .
 dont think we will see her after 2025 .
 if kena caught by hawker sure ask u to pay la .
 i just learnt a new phrase today .
 what are some examples of degree miles ?
 when chiu see their cert from india and all distinctions grades .
 see liao ,  confirm is talent .
 at first i thought he was a super talent and after working with him make me vomit blood
 i think to be a mill ,  maybe just buy a printer ,  rent a space ,  advertise 3 mths for mba ,  6 mths for phd .
 then students show up and play daidee for 1 hour a week for 3 mths then chiu can award them mba liao .
 who wants to enter this joint venture w me ?
 chiu need to educate your parents .
 they still think this is the pap of old
 seriously singapore education system have a problem .
 sinkie spend almost 15 years of our life going to school (if including playgroup and kindergarten ,  that will be 20 years) and yet we are losing out in the employment arena to some foreigners that arm with a degree from a degree mill .
 not counting the amount of money we spend in this 15 to 20 years .
 why are we spending so much money and time to study ?
 just go india degree mill and buy a degree will do .
 actually this is a hard truth lol .
 need add this under .
 the moment i was writing a while loop for a ceca with straight distinctions on his transcript and earning 7k  .
 i knew the system got big loophole or problem
 if chiu can buy a degree how hard isit to but a master or docgorate .
 just change title nia for $5 extra
 howbto migrate to india for education ?
 they will say they didnt know it &apos;s a forged degree .
 then it will be disregarded but now they oredi have other qualifications and experience
 they are gonna lose more in the future ,  cos all those who believed in them are dying off .
 it will be the youngsters world soon .
 not everyone will blindly follow the blind .
 thats when they start to panic 
 their plan i believe is to give out more pink ics to mitigate this .
 and draw  &apos;better &apos; grc boundaries
 they claim bona fide ,  then boh taichi liao .
 oredi got example .
 so foreigners can buy a degree ,  work with friend ,  and gain experience .
 soon they can work in singapore .
 meanwhile fresh grads here somehow needs work experience to gain interviews 
 waiting for it to eat its own words .
 quote - ida stood by its decision and said that they hired the person based on her bachelor &apos;s degree and work experience .
 ida oso said that the employee  &apos;had genuinely believed her mba programme to be bona fide ,  and she had put in effort to obtain the qualification .
 so ,  an honest mistake finally accepted from a peasant ?
  the rest follow (army style) .
 mom should work with them  .
 then they will understand what is vomit blood .
 when i said work with them is really get a big project and work with them  .
 i experienced so many times already
 many market oso got
 that time was at pek kio market a row of pigeon basically stare at me while i was eating .
 like telling me save some for them
 reminder that hbl left 1 more week yet we are seeing unprecedented cases .
 exam period so no
 home based exam soon
 they should the school holidays right after the final examinations .
 should be thinking safe rather then putting youngsters and kids at unnecessary risks .
 cb dorms enough liao
 exams start on 11 oct for lower primaries .
 how to hbl and exam ?
 close schools ,  early december holidays and autopromote all students to the next level .
 if dont hbl ,  next year no more lower primaries to promote !
 my ginnas hope it extends until end of term 4 then no need sit for sa2 liao .
 should is different from will
 maybe they will .
 push forward the 6 weeks holiday then december back to school for sa2 ?
 a snap cb of 10 days .
 dunnid a lock down .
 just a snap cb coincide with some holidays .
 i hope moe will exercise critical thinking to this discussion and request .
 it requires imminent attention to this grave situation given how the infected cases rose over the past few days .
 re-opening of schools ,  transportation and movement of unvaccinated children and population within premise ,  is a reckless and insensible act .
 i hope there will be influential people who can step up and calling out moe and moh to think twice before ending the hbl coming week .
 we oredi had enough of covid infection and death ,  and we certainly want to evade this crash .
 likely they have to for those smaller ones not taking exams
 secondary school so many teachers on loa oredi .
 not enough staff .
 just all hbl lah
 huai chiu never send them for tuition ?
 why not just do a collaboration with uptron .
 then straight away all kids graduate with an uptron certification
 the problem with this delta strain is it is definitely not acting by the script set by moh and oyk .
 even our hwz members who rarely go out get infected unknowingly ,  so this delta is very crafty and highly transmissible .
 given solid data collected for the past 1 week and rising deaths ,  as well as increasing dorm cases ,  how can we ignore this calling signs and not acting with common sense ?
 can bringing children back to school spurs our gdp ?
 i am not a scholar nor am an intelligent man .
  i am just a professional taxi driver ,  but i have the humane and empathy to ensure our elderly and children to be as safe as possible .
 can moh and moe ,  for once make a sensible ,  common sense choice and decision ?
 i forced my kid to stardee until 12 midnight every day and hire 6 private tutors for him .
 how can let him be the same as other stewdents ?
 they no speak hindi so steel bu ky 
 this confirm fake news ,  we all know cheena restrict power cos they want to down the imperialists and deny them of their xmas presents .
 who ask them gang up on cheena serve them right .
 not taking sides here but for a very face-culture ,  the u turn is quite embarassing .
 need to eat backward grass .
 that oni proves one thing .
 the propaganda news on cheena getting it from other resources got more than enough coal to go around in edmw isn’t factual .
 this literally is evidence that jjww from wumaos really exist in edmw .
 from this statement oredi know chiu have never been to australia before and all chiu know is from ccp propaganda .
 people do ask where chiu are from and when chiu say singapore they know where it is .
 it is not like those ccp ibs fake news bullshet trying to paint other people as ignorant fools who dunno how to read a map .
 now is 2021 not 1950s ,  unless they are rural farmers ,  most people know the countries in their region unlike the tiongs who think everything is belong to cheena .
 i and many others have indeed went into australia for vacation with no problems .
 aussie going bankrupt hok ,  kind and benevolent leader winnie pooh xi will win .
 tiongs can eat grass for 1 yr ,  aussie can oni drink milk .
 their milk no melamine .
 how can be better then ccp milk !
 thats why aussies sure lost the war mah .
 sure no reach mah .
 some places still literally having blackout .
 maybe their coal focus is to make sure everyone can go back online and hear warming xi thoughts .
 not for their heaters
 lol joke sia got people who went on insulting people in this thread becuause people point out truths
 ironically it was ccp who said aussie will suffer from this coal thingy but look where we are now .
 this is the sad thing about the ccp .
 keep saying things and try to act tough .
 and now must come eat humble pie .
 wonder how does that taste .
 but oso goes to show ,  more and more things that the ccp are saying ,  they cannot really stick to it and may be just saying it to try to save face or to deflect .
 wasnt the first time they do that ,  wont be the last .
 now waiting for them to backtrack on zero covid oso and realize they need to develop some kinda  &apos;endemic &apos; solution
 why got one user so triggered here in the previous page ?
 he looks like clone leh start with b one
 finally it decided not to sacrifice cheena peasant lives for “face”
 dont be stupid .
 invest means want to see roi .
 if no roi ,  we wont invest there .
 it &apos;s not about liking or not liking .
 you &apos;re using your emotions to invest and thats a sure failure .
 looks like cheena finally knows it need to invade australia to secure its supplies .
 i think chiu are the sensitive one .
 why are chiu busily defending cheena ?
 people here mock usa and cheena and dont get worked up but chiu seemed to be worked up .
 do chiu have a special affinity or bond with cheena ?
 or are chiu from prc ?
 qxpress is the best .
 i have used them 4 times in the past 2 weeks .
 book tdy for tomorrow &apos;s slot ,  item will be delivered the day after .
 30 nia cheap cheap .
 i have the same problem too !
 i ordered from shopee 29 april 2020 .
 1 may 2020 is at ninja van .
 till date no updates at all and it claimed that is not even pick up
 they use bicycle to deliver so slow  ?
 today ph no delivery ?
 heng my ninjavan delivery no issue
 ninjavan message me on my last delivery .
 sms message not clear but one thing in the message piss me off .
 if recipient not in ,  package will be left at doorstep .
 woa ,  my purchase barang like no value .
 at doorstep ,  if lost ,  not their responsibility .
 simi lanjiao delivery .
 immediately uninstall shopee app .
 not going to buy from shopee if is ninja van  , oni j&t express then order now .
 your intolerance of others might get yourself killed sooner or quicker .
 ya even items local deliveries cant do well .
 norm is 1 day in warehouse next day = delivered .
 even cheena in cheena deliveries to different province oso not that long .
 chiu guys dont get to eat lunch right ?
 one of your delivery men told me .
 morning warehouse crowded ,  frequently blocked by neighbour container truck ,  lorry ,  etc .
 diva customer set time limit then van zoom here zoom there ,  increase delivery time for other customers ,  decrease efficiency .
 pickup parcel oso customer never seal ,  wait uh wait uh ,  eat into next customers time .
 cash on delivery wait uh wait uh ,  lagi best .
 hats off to chiu .
 my decathlon item finally arrived yesterday .
 seems like they never update the tracking .
 cause till now still show pending them to collect the item from decathlon since 27 april 2020 .
 two word ,  poor management .
 are we able to check which company they are using ?
 then j & t gets all the business and becomes slower .
 its the planning .
 accepting orders even though overloaded then sub contracting to other companies is a waste of time .
 just stop at a limit .
 seems dhl and fedex is oni expensive for sinkies ,  usa ships to singapore as low as $5
 to delivery drivers ,  your item has no value .
 whether it &apos;s $1 or $1000 ,  it looks the same from outside .
 chiu will be shocked to see how your item gets thrown around like frisbees from lorries to sorting to last mile vans then to you
 jnt tried to outbid other delivery coy for majority share of shopee contract and won .
 now they cant handle the volume ,  they subcon a huge part of their shopee volume to other coy at a loss .
 head too small hat too big
 small head think can expand fast enough to fit big hat !
 more volume more drivers .
 not enough capacity ,  please work together and share the pie .
 customers are promised proper handling but high volume leads to anyhowling of the parcel .
 its not just ninjavan .
 all logistics hire prcs to some extent to sort parcels .
 even if rise ,  2% nia .
 1 hour pottery class $150 .
 restaurant $50 per person can queue 1 hour  .
 scared what gst ?
 sinkies are rich ,  richest people in the world .
 even if gst rise 20% oso no scared !
 for me gst is a big deal .
  it is really intrusive and really negate my quality of living further .
 i am oredi stress over the current inflation and i cannot imagine what would life becoming when gst revised to 9% .
 i am very worried and concern .
 mai kpkb gst is to help the poor
 oredi paying min $500 gst every month .
 with the hike in gst ,  monthly amount will rocket to $1k .
 paying this amount of money ever month to fund the foreigners ?
 they think we stupid ?
 hope gahment keep raising gst .
 i cant wait to make my first gst 9% hoot liao .
 moi going to hoard junk .
 no need to buy new things .
 sennheiser momentum 2 is $289 on amazon .
 sony xm4 is $309 on shopee .
 sennheiser m2 has better details than sony xm4 or boseqc ,  if chiu tested them in a quiet place .
 for myself ,  i ended up with bose qc and jabra 85t ,  not cos they sound good ,  but cos they don’t hurt my shallow ears as much .
 if chiu don’t have problems with previous buds ,  and need to use it out and about ,  the xm4 will be better .
 m2 better if oni used in quiet places .
 whichever chiu choose ,  none can compare to the sound of wired earphones ,  and no good wired earphones sound can compare with good wired headphones .
 and then chiu need a good dac ,  and then a good source ,  and lossless sounds better .
 then when chiu get tired of everything ,  just f it and get an airpods pro for convenience ,  and start looking for the newest wireless online ,  which is why i still have my airpods pro .
 this is what she tell u after 2 week .

 chiu sprained your hand and needs 2 weeks rest ?
 these two weeks is excuse for her to piak piak with the other guy .
 chiu should take this chance to go piak piak other girls also
 its honest truth .
 many bros and uncles here can attest to it .
 this kind of cb lowball tactic girls play

 pray for the best and prepare for the worst .
 may the odds be in your favour

 time to say goodbye ,  mr spare tyre .
 in before “staying with friend”
 ts need to learn the lesson .
 to understand how fake and hypocrite some girls can be  .
 if i were him ,  pump the gf gao gao first
 thankfully there is still some redpilled to give proper advice here .
 post the same q in places like reddit going to get very different answers  .
 why no one tell me  ?
 i admit loh i don’t stay condo so dont know
 condo no aircon one .
 huh ,  from your own eyes ,  chiu can find out the answer oredi lol
 most is individual  .
 some actually are central
 wa those condo got central one can save alot on air con servicing fees
 think those are old types but rich types .
 most you &apos;ll think are units covered all the time .
 the air conditioning bills are tremendous !
 on all the time and big units .
 on plus side ,  condo management handles your air conditioning issues
 wendy ,  chiu know that stay condo need to pay monthly or bi-monthly maintenance fee 1 ?
 guess where all the money for all the servicing come from ?
 ha ha maintenance fees is about $300 -$400  a month  ?
 if include air con and parking lot etc is ok loh  .
 then got facilities too
 share central aircon ,  must go downstair use ,  by booking first come first serve ,  and limit to 1 hour usage per pax
 usually new developments not using centralised aircon .
 most are decentralised aircon .
 me is paying $800+ per quarter for 4 bedder in a 600+ units development .
 they give oni one carpark lot .
 aircon first year free service under dlp period .
 after that ,  can arrange own contractor .
 expensive or average price？
 means it’s not expensive .
 cos consider it this way; hdb s&cc oredi $70+ and parking for mscp $120 .
 3 months will be close to $600 .
 unit own one ,  not central
 can u turn off centralized aircon or not ?
 or 24 7 blowing ?
 but maintenance fees higher
 atas condo ducted aircon most of the time
 lai lai share your thoughts
 if started ,  going for it .
 i plan to go ahead and get 20 jabs

 message of the video: angmo will always be our overlords
 is it consider racisim or what ?
 my daughter’s classmates thought i am her sister and they told her i am cool .
 she showed me the whatsapp and i was like  but my son is the headache one la .
 so its not easy bringing up children .
 blackpink lisa’s new song .
 i dont expect my partner to doll herself up ,  as long have some self maintenance is fine for me liao
 fear is one thing .
 just look at whole thing is bigger perspective .
 well ,  it all depends on what chiu want in life .
 if ,  like spg ,  chiu have some other purpose ,  great .
 but if chiu actually want to be with a woman ,  want have a relationship ,  get married ,  start a family ,  but then chiu hold back cos chiu are afraid of losing - whether breakups or divorces ,  etc .
  ,  that seems like a pretty sad and unfulfilling way to live .
 one day chiu are going to die ,  and chiu are going to look back on your life .
 chiu are going to leave with nothing anyway ,  the last thing chiu have will be your memories .
 and chiu have to face yourself and answer the question ,  what did i do with my life ?
 what it is that i wanted ,  did i at least try to get it ?
 i see a few mothers esp my vietbu neighbor shouting & screaming at her kids all day .
 but i get what they do that cos the kids dont listen .
 do u raise yr voice at yr own kids ?
 im curious to how chiu make yr kids listen to u .
 alot of people think the oni way is to raise voice otherwise the kids not scared .
 moi like a gal that is manicured 
 i use soft approach first talk talk talk no use then cane come out   that was when they were young children la .
 now of cos cannot employ this method .
 try my best to talk sense into them lor and oso keep an eye on their actions  .
 oso we as parents must try to set an example lor .
 but no guarantee works .
 by the way sorry to ts cos like out of topic liow .
 living is oso about personal growth ,  self discovery ,  and experimenting with new things ,  if chiu dont try chiu wont know .
 coming out of a failed relationship what did chiu learn ?
 if chiu oni failed once then decide to exclude yourself from trying ,  its a little sad cause of the things chiu will miss out .
 theory like this we all know .
 but about where ts is now and console him .
 all wonderful concepts oso need ts able to get 1 girl first .
 the rest will be natural .
 yes ,  back to ts .
 mly had provided several good suggestions on where to meet girls and how to talk to girls .
 i will add one more suggestion: go work out .
 while personality trumps looks ,  it never hurts to build up your other areas too .
 ts ,  chiu are 23 and have all the time in the world .
 if chiu start working out now ,  chiu will get results and chiu will grow in confidence .
 there &apos;s a million free fitness programs on youtube .
 pick one ,  any one ,  and go with it .
 or even easier .
 very simple goals .
 ts: aim for 100 pushups ,  40 burpees ,  10 pull-ups a day .
 keep running your 2 .
 4 twice a week ,  try and improve until chiu hit 12 min .
 doesnt matter how long chiu take to get there .
 4/12 straight chiu will automatically set yourself higher targets and keep going .
 your confidence will grow not just from the feeling of being in good shape ,  it will grow from the knowledge that chiu can set yourself targets and achieve them .
 find blogs on men &apos;s dressing and grooming .
 meet people ,  dont just try and chase supermodels .
 meet and talk to less pretty girls ,  treat them with respect .
 if they dont treat chiu with respect ,  smile and say chiu have to go .
 you &apos;re just making friends after all .
 if the girl is nice chiu grow with every interaction and ,  congratulations !
 you &apos;ve made a friend .
 when chiu have the basics chiu can further develop the traits mly talks about - humour ,  etc .
 ignore the people who try and drag chiu down .
 but this is key: chiu have to take action .
 if chiu sit on your ass and wait for fate or luck or women to drop from the sky then obviously nothing will happen .
 all this applies to anyone ,  by the way .
 it is never too late to start .
 if chiu keep at it ,  sooner or later chiu will meet girls who like chiu .
 sooner or later chiu will find yourself liking one of these girls .
 come back here and tell us your success stories .
 pretty sure your dad cares for chiu too .
 maybe he didnt express himself or he was guarding chiu from a distance .
 yes parenthood is challenging .
 both hub and wife have different roles .
 i play bad cop .
 wife plays good cop .
 i guess thats how many families and organisations work .
 when chiu joining us as a parent ?
 come share with us .
 when get married and how many kids chiu want ?
 your girl is mature .
 they are a different story .
 my 2 boys oso headache .
 one dont want to study .
 the other hot tempered .
 we are a dink couple ,  dont want children ,  i like kids but cant see myself as taking care of 1 .
 i didnt have a happy childhood and am now estranged from my family ,  so i dont think i have the capability to provide a happy healthy life to my kids .
 i see chiu all so happy abd proud of your kids ,  is very heart warming ,  im sure they really love chiu back de .
 how old are your 2 boys ?
 thanks for providing your point of view and sharing your analogy  ,  i actually kinda enjoy reading your post cause chiu try to analyze and share from different point of view which is really interesting .
 at the same time time  ,  chiu dont promote fake optimism/hypocritical answer nor overly cynical thoughts but rather a source of truth standpoint based on what is happening on the ground .
  in a sense  ,  i guess im still lucky enough in life that i dont fall into the black pill category .
 having said that in all honest truth ,  if your husband is oni 1 .
 58m tall  ,  would chiu even have consider him back then ?
 and oso if height itself isnt important for guys  ,  would chiu rather your son to be 1 .
 a short women doesnt suffer really any height humiliation or discrimination as compared to a short guy where the psychological long term effect in life is real and brutal starting from his childhood years .
 unfortunately  ,  i dont have any expectational talent like messi to make up for my short height  ,  neither do i possess super high intelligence to be funny and creative or rich enough to travel the world .
 im just a average short guy working in a average corporate job waiting to pay my bill like most people out there .
 no  ,  i have never really thought of getting attached  ,  married or have kids partially due to height issues  ,  plus the fact that i dont really stand out among the groups of guys  ,  i probably belong to the 3/10 type of guys rating category thus i have no intention of knowing anyone out there but to just go chiong and fulfill my lust and desire .
 u have 4 children   .
 yes i agree girls are more mature .
 yes i will still consider him at that time cos i wanted a family man and his character fits this well .
 some things are not what we can choose .
 like my son has speech delay so we just have to accept it .
 i became a housewife partly cos of this .
 from presch all the way to pri school i had to bring him for speech therapy .
 no point wallowing in self pity .
 i am quite lucky that after all these intervention there is improvement and he is secondary school now .
 if i were to have your mindset ,  then just give up is it ?
 i have seen guys that are my height but they exude confidence lor .
 they work on their physique and communication skills instead .
 if u feel that u really dislike your height there is actually those surgery that can lengthen your legs so u can increase your height as much as the doctors can allow .
 i 46 still thinking of marrying some woman  .
 who she representing ah ?
 cos there &apos;s an audience .
 if no one quotes her posts ,  no one shares them ,  she &apos;ll stop .
 she got clear and vet by huddy before she posts ?
 edmwer bbfa are fans of her wall of text 
 preparing for next post .
 if u know what i mean
 she is the hubby .
 what chiu  tokking
 future president of sg
 cos she jlb charsiew 
 maybe she is bored

 she truly cares .
 she &apos;s lonely and bored .
 after semi-retirement ,  trying to stay relevant and be heard .
 is empress dowager .
 listen to my commands !
 this is normal behaviors of people about to retire toward their company .
 slowly wind the fire and sit back watch the fun .
 my office alot of lao jiao after retirement age on yearly renewal now always liddat ,  slowly putting little sparks here and there to see fire up and enjoy the fun of many people fighting fire .
 i dont understand why are all these people so important .
 it &apos;s not like they give benefits and rewards to their fans .
 beginning to suspect some of the posters here are marketing people .
 they almost always immediately start a thread whenever sph/cna/calvin cheng/ho ching posts something .
 why are these people &apos;s posts even on anyone &apos;s social media feed ?
 fighting to become the people &apos;s prez
 which ceca draw this graphic one ?
 wonder how many of these quacks are now at singapore treating patients ,  drawing nice pays and piaking sinkie mm
 interesting ,  foreign talents are - .
 create jobs for locals .
 do jobs locals dont wanna do .

 fake academic qualifications ?
 so i conduct a course and give out a degree is considered as a degree mill since no one accredit me ?
 this jo teo really one kind .
 my kids can no need study so hard to go nus .
 by online can le
 yes u can buy degree from unaccredited school and use it to get employed .
 after few years of experience ,  your degree no longer matters and u continue to rise up the ranks by talking big .
 change jobs every few years before **** hits the fan .
 based on what the pap is doing ,  that is not entirely untrue .
 creating jobs for foreigners benefit sinkies .
 this is a fact .
 even though there are some with fake degrees ,  they are still talents .
 i am sure mom has done well to ensure foreign talents are welcome here under joteo manpower policies .
 should be toothpick lim era one   .
 that time this one oso nothing .
 and company can go ahead and employ chiu no wrong .
 unaccredited degree in cecaland is cheap ,  short duration and easy pass .
 they come here drive salary to rock bottom .
 satki spu wan swee .
 yup they have all sort of courses and duration one as long as chiu can pay for it .
 hope offer overseas e-learning before the gst sets in  
 degree mill > accredited 
 in canada ,  degree mill = fake degree .
 then last time i study so hard for fark .
 should have bought my certs from all the degree mills~~

 it is the  &apos;home that matter &apos;   .
 what that is inside the house
 wait chiu kena 1 indian from india use coconut oil on hair ,  see how the smell !
 moral of the story … cannot afford air con
 mostly are individual ,  very few use centralised ac .
 another important thing buyers tend to ignore and got a shock when they move in
 depends on the condo .
 some centralised and some not .
 it is factor into the monthly maintenance fees .
 oni mass market condo with lot of mickey mouse units can have this kind of maintenance cost and those won’t be centralised
 ducted aircon is still linked to individual unit compressor .
 those older resi building with central aircon systems all turned off and everyone must diy own aircon oredi .
 majority are not central aircon
 they charge u oso dunno how to quantify
 but if central air con breakdown chiu are stuck .
 whole house cannot work .
 at least if individual unit break down still got chance .
 such rates is considered v cheap liao .
 condo is swiss standard living .
 got swiss microclimate .
 some times will snow too .
 chiu can ask your father this simple question .
 all condos individual .
 think some built before 1990s still using central air con
 u may save alot of aircon bill but your maintenance bill will kill you
 of course is individual unit air-con except function rooms ,  gym and ktv room .
 maintenance fee does not include electricity bill .
 ibs come in liao bo ?
 shame on these people  !
 as a chinese citizen my heart stops beating when i see cheena dependent on foreign powers .
 the century of humiliation hasn’t taught us to be self sufficient  !
 we as chinese citizens must turn off all electricity appliances ,  and expel all foreign factories to teach these evil angmo lesson  !
 god emperor xi jinping prease do the needful and expel all angmo company from cheena  .
 let’s turn to mao’s teachings and the little red book and make our country prosper .
 the source claims unknown people from trading .
 why did the chinese rely on coal and not award the japanese hundreds of trillion of dollars projects to build nuclear power plants ?
 at the end of the day ,  $$$ talk .
 dont get my role playing ah .
 moi trolling la .
 see the wumaos so triggered and in denial mode jin funny .
 think they foaming in their mouths now  
 later he expel the foreign companies then find out really need them then have to eat humble pie and beg them to come back how liddat ?
 there is oni so much face that the ccp have left .
 but on the other hand ,  i guess they lost so much face oredi it cannot get any more worse
 coal more important than bone gas  .
 cheena has started unloading a small number of australian coal shipments despite an unofficial import ban ,  analysts said ,  in a move underscoring the intensity of the power crunch facing the world’s second-largest economy .
 nick ristic ,  lead dry cargo analyst at braemar acm shipbroking ,  said a handful of australian cargoes waiting outside chinese ports since a ban came into force a year ago had headed into berth last month and draft change had been observed ,  indicating that the coal had been unloaded .
 he said 450 , 000 tonnes of coal had been discharged .
 energy research company kpler oso said a total of five vessels waiting offshore had discharged 383 , 000 tonnes of australian thermal coal into cheena last month .
 it is possible the discharged coal had been resold to other countries ,  but traders said this was unlikely cos of signals from chinese authorities that it would be allowed to clear customs .
 last year beijing reportedly ordered state-owned energy companies and steel mills to stop importing australian coal immediately ,  in a blow to the country’s a$55bn ($39bn) a year coal export industry .
 australia shipped 35m tonnes of thermal coal to cheena in 2020 and closer to 50m tonnes in 2018 and 2019 ,  according to argus media ,  a commodity price assessment group .
 after november 2020 ,  overall coal exports to the asian nation dropped to “effectively zero” , according to wood mackenzie .
 ​but since then ,  chinese provinces have been hit with power rationing so severe that in some places factories have been allowed to operate for oni two days a week ,  threatening economic growth and the global supply chain .
 on tuesday ,  china’s banking and insurance regulator called on financial institutions to increase their risk tolerance for loans to coal plants “to ensure that the people live warmly through the winter” .
 it oso banned banks from withdrawing loans to plants and mines that were otherwise in compliance and warned them against speculating on bulk commodities including coal and steel .
 lara dong ,  who leads greater cheena power and renewables research at ihs markit ,  said the move to allow a few shipments to start being delivered was unlikely to be a sign of a broader policy reversal .
 “i see it as a sign of policy loosening ,  it doesn’t seem to mean a big difference in coal imports from australia , ” she said .
 the shortages ,  which have oso hit some household users ,  gathered steam in large part owing to coal supply shortages and higher domestic and international prices .
 this has made coal-fired power generation uneconomic cos of price controls .
 the most actively traded coal contract on the zhengzhou commodity exchange was near a record high of rmb1 , 393 .
 60 ,  or $216 a tonne ,  on thursday ,  the last day before a week-long public holiday in cheena .
 it has risen by almost 75 per cent in the past month .
 provinces including jilin have in recent days called for increased imports of coal from indonesia ,  russia and mongolia .
 reports on monday said china’s zhejiang province had brought in its first shipment of thermal coal from kazakhstan .
 dong said it was unclear whether imports would oso be a cure for the country’s power woes .
 “it’s so expensive now .
 the gahment is encouraging imports but who will pay ?
 coal shipped from indonesia — china’s biggest supplier — jumped sharply last week .
 medium quality indonesian coal was changing hands at a record high of $166 .
 5 a tonne ,  the highest level since argus started assessing indonesia coal in 2004 .
 while china’s biggest coal miners have pledged to increase production and go all out to help beat the power crisis ,  analysts are sceptical they can respond quickly enough to make a difference this winter .
 goldman sachs last week cut its 2021 cheena growth forecast to 7 .
 8 per cent from 8 .
 2 per cent ,  citing “significant downside pressures” from energy shortages .
 conflicting policy signals have oso contributed to the crunch ,  as the country implements so-called “dual control” regulations aimed at decreasing both energy consumption and energy intensity .
 provinces have been racing to meet strict consumption targets under the rules ,  after a large number failed to reach the goals in the first half of the year .
 last year xi jinping ,  china’s president ,  vowed that the world’s biggest polluter would reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 .
 bone gas vs special edition .
 bone gas vs coal .
 all pung pui to share some warmth and love !
 cheena so big ,  so strong ,  ownself no coal mine ?
 sigh… bro am trolling these wumaos .
 lmao where are those kumgong wumaos and dicksons ?
 everyday chanting “aus is screwed ,  customer is king” ,  bloody idiots don’t understand how reality works .
 customer is king if the goods is a want ,  not a need .
 somemore aus is probably the largest exporter of such a “need” goods .
 ccp’s wumaos program really fail ,  employ such brainless zombies ,  no wonder their propaganda program failing here .
 and they were supposed to have “phd” and “king of science” within their ranks .
 from ccpuptron maybe ?
 moi go walk walk look see hawker centres ,  kopitiams boh simi lang leh ,  why ah .
 thought all chiong liao
 2 people per table very hard for families to sit  .
 plus most people got used to dabao oredi for safety reasons .
 thought is jin crowded
 wait til &apos; weekends 
 not everyone wants to clean their own mess ,  at least for now .
 even mcd oso hardly any people .
 i walked past yesterday morning .
 oni saw 1-2 persons nia .
 but when i walked to ah kun ,  wa ,  full house sia .
 all lim kopi eat gooyou toast 
 maybe too many people kena chopped and bled until no blood .
 so ,  most of them are preparing their breakfast and lunch at home liao .
 or every one dont want their hc to be the next cluster area .
 if mcd allow their bts meal to be sold over the counter ,  some of the glass doors would be broken by now .
 i think still not safe out there .
 bbfas jin happy .
 i see many bbfas happily eating their caipeng ,  ramen ,  kfc ,  bk .
 its true all are bui bui ,  no need fight for seats
 last night i walked pass the downstairs kopitiam ,  see many lao unkers sit in groups of 4 or 5 ,  talk loudly and lim jiu
 many peep got phobia with the utensils not being used for too long… scared got ka-chuak crawl lay eggs … .
 most will wait a week then slowly pick up the pace …
 now this morning after 9am ?
 if now many people inside these place then dua kee leow ,  all kena retrenched no need to work .
 popular dining places lots of people .
 depends on location .
 not as crowded .
 was able to find table and eat .
 goes to show pap and their nonsense killed off many f & b places .
 with more hawkers ,  coffee shops and restaurants closing ,  more of these people will be unhappy with pap for ruining things

 im not sure why shopee allows such long delivery pickup .
 ninja hasn &apos;t collected my item ordred on wed yet .
 for another item ,  i decided to check out the merchant on platforms other than shopee or laz and found that qoo10 has it ,  so bought from qoo10 instead .
 qoo10 had better vouchers too .
 mine was this monday pick up oso ,  just received .
 yesterday the status was 6th to 8th may by 10pm .
 today - estimated delivery .
 the date is screwed .
 *i &apos;m no expert* .
 amazon probably got priority ?
 > bought stuff with delivery on may 12 (cheapest option) .
 > shipped saying may 11 (the date for more expensive option) .
 > today (may 9) morning received sms ,  ninja van noon delivered .
 my 5 may collected item finally reached the w/h on 9 may .
 my 6 may ordered item will probably oni be collected from seller on 11 may .
 yet my shopee order made before 10 may evening has oredi been picked up by urbanfox on 11 may .

 big development is always cheaper
 how condo with central aircon work ?
 every unit can select temperature ?
 can select which room want aircon ?
 or is like shopping center
 if central air con  ,  that means the electricity bill is paid out of the maintenance fees  ?
 then those who seldom use the aircon will be subsidising those who leave it on the whole day  ?
 if shopping mall they can track electricity city for their tenants condo can do it to .
 or shopping malls the retail units  they dont have separate electricity bills .
 that is the usual maintenance fee without the central air conditioning .
    most condo dont have central air conditioning;  may be the very high class type .
   it will be much cheaper to have your own airconditioning unit .
 of course we &apos;re talking condos that cost well over $5m a unit .
 even the carpark has ac with air freshener injected so chiu dont smell the exhaust of the v10s and w12s
  ya when first get keys everything in except bed and tv
 central ac is usually chilled water .
 the level of cooling is determined by the flow rate through the cooling coils .
 very easy to select indoor unit temperature using a motor valve on the cooling water line .
 central ac does not work that way .
 you &apos;re talking about ducted ac with shared cold air vents and hot air returns .
 this will never be used in a high end condo - maybe except for common areas .
 ah ok thanks for clarification .
 those days i used to work for employment agent .
 we oso indians la ,  sinkies .
 but whenever a worker from india has to come to office .
 the boss will quickly say open all window ,  off aircon/ cos really la ,  the coconut oil smell will linger for days in the aircon system .
 a ducted a/c filters probably need replacing haha .
 if chiu open the false ceiling ,  chiu will find the ducted ac is no different from an oversized wall hanging unit .
 ah yes ,   i just remembered .
  someone said that her fw bf services air con in fast food restaurants  in shopping malls .
  service oni for the particular unit leh .
 who really knows .
 maybe becoming superhuman .
 tats why many unvaxxed hopefully staying at home watching .
 can oni tell in 10 to 20yrs .
 power leh chiu ,  go collect all the vaccines  
 yes its not compulsory ,  but they can always intro rule to restrict dining in unless 3rd jab .
 it happened before ,  it can happen again .
 they are giving free bee hoon for piaking booster ?
 signing up now !
 me more worried about whether can choose the type of vaccine to take or must take mrna
 not oni 3rd jab hor .
  4th ,  5th 6th to infinity awaiting .
 must ask @tuv2008 lol
 i rather chenghu give us free 6 months pub bills .
 should have jab machines at all places that need vaxxing .
 stick your arm in and boom chiu are done .
 soon arm like junkie .
 i think it would be better to piak the same vaccine chiu had the first two times than to mix vaccine .
 anyway i oredi jabbed pfizer earlier so i dont have an issue .
 the real question is does a third jab actually help against new variants
 not surprised if it is really implemented  
 heng i can cook my own bee hoon ,  can satisfy cravings anytime  
 better start telling the people we will lost our jobs if we dont go for booster
 must have time frame right how is too long ?
 if didnt jab 3rd one in time ,  back to have to start from 1st jab again ?
  i think just dunnid to keep on jabbing .
 looks like there is no end to this vaccination cycle ,  every 6 months rinse and repeat
 not compulsory bs again  ?
 as long as effective against all variants ,  and allows me to travel and for us to open up our economy ,  definitely will jab .
 trust the science .
 not the religious skeptics
 yes not compulsory for now at least    .
 we still have a choice  
 dont give u cure .
 but keep on loading the poison .
 just like a addict ,  cannot dont take the addiction .
   never solve but make problem more jialat .

 halimah not worried  , why chiu worry ?
 plus alot of fanboys here keep reposting
 to trigger edmw bbfa few times a day
 if chiu got so much money ,  no accountability in whatever failure chiu did ,  hold power to a country .
 chiu will post whole day oso .
 literally the whole world belong to chiu .

 at least chiu are working .
 some guys cant even find work .
 i think chiu judge yourself too harshly .
 3/10 seems real pessimistic man .
 chiu can always start to work on the things that chiu like to do .
 dunnid to attempt to  &apos;look cool &apos; or  &apos;stand out &apos; for girls to notice chiu .
 if chiu are working on your purpose ,  and girls happen to see that in chiu ,  they will approach chiu one .
 of course chiu must oso let them in la .
 if chiu oni think chiu going to chiong ,  pump and go then all those things dont matter cause chiu oredi lost in your own thinking .
 yeah i try to be realistic ,  since i never really have a good dating experience .
 i done virtually all of what bzzbzz mentioned .
 i am pretty sure the girls i have been aiming for ,  are not vastly out of my league .
 one thing i realised few years back ,  is that i started to lose the feeling of emotional connection especially with local girls .
 maybe cos i tried my best and keep failing many ,  many times and going abroad ,  my success rate with girls there improved significantly .
 simple stuff like inviting girls over to my dormitory for heart-to-heart talk ,  i have never been able to do this with local girls ,  but succeeded with foreign girls (jhb/vietbu) .
 i was extremely thrilled when the jhb gal baked me some cookies .
 and this is a feeling i will always remember .
 i realised ,  the solution is ultimately to switch my dating pool and right now ,  i am a more positive person than before .
 i improve for myself and oni for myself ,  not for a girl .
 i certainly do not intend to find someone who is oni there for me ,  when i am at my peak .
 and at my lowest ,  i knew the type of girls that were there for me .
 i remembered their characteristics and nature .
 all i can say is that chiu have to believe in yourself .
 chiu have to think chiu are worth it .
 chiu have to think chiu are worth giving yourself a chance .
  if chiu just wont accept that ,  well .
 well ,  good on chiu !
 and i think chiu are ready the next level .
 a man like chiu .
 could use some game  .
 invest in a sex doll
 perhaps chiu havent developed maternal instincts yet .
 should be around 30s onwards .
 dunno your age .
 at some point after marriage ,  couples will get sick and tired of each other .
 then the desire will arise .
 keep an open mind .
 yes ,  it is a joy having kids .
 lots more frustration .
 but it is absolutely worth it .
 gives meaning and purpose to life .
 i didnt have a happy childhood too .
 thats another similar thread we share .
 feel free to share if chiu want to 
 last time no tv mah .
 the oni entertainment was .
 i dunno how i kept my sanity .
 mly uncle ,  what will chiu impart your sons for their future escapades ?
 its a good question .
 i do not know what to teach them in this department .
 i am guessing they will find their own .
 i think my children should be alright looking .
  my 2 girls were models for their school website and school magazine .
 elder girl was prom queen in sec 4 .
 people say my sons quite ham .
 dont think they will have challenges finding partners .
 am just drilling into the boys dont get young girls pregnant .
 not fair to the girls .
 that is good advice but accidents still can happen so i think the sense of responsibility is important to teach .
 i watch videos on yt that childrens who do not get enough  &apos;dad time &apos; will have adverse social effect when they interact with society in the future .
 girls that grow up without much interaction with their father will usually have  &apos;daddy issues &apos; .
 i think that point has been covered over across the media and quite well known .
 however i think people might missed out that boys that do not get to interact with their father might have a harder time in the future to seek out their spouse cos he will have to navigate from zero again .
 a bit similar to ts where he has to come to edmw to seek for advice .
 wanted to see if chiu have any insights on this topic  
 yes ,  i am aware of the absentee father stats .
 boys resort to porn .
 girls seek love outside their home by trading their bodies .
 it is a sad scenario .
 hence i hold on tight to my marriage .
 for my kids sake .
 marriage is tough .
 i lost my father at 11 .
 he ran away with another woman .
 never saw him since .
 before that he was violent to me and abused me physically .
 yes ,  i had to navigate all myself from zero .
 alot depends on how a person responds to adversity .
 i saw myself as lacking .
 so i try to learn at every opportunity .
 this habit continues till today .
 there are many who are blessed with better childhoods than mine .
 but instead of improving ,  they give all sorts of excuses .
 so me thinks it doesnt mean a person starting from zero without a dad is doomed .
 neither is one who has all the comforts in life guaranteed success .
 life is what chiu make out of it .
 re ts ,  if chiu follow his posts ,  he is a humble chap and is willing to learn .
 these kind of people will sail through challenges .
 but your children teenagers liow confirm got tv liow leh someone lcd tv 
 as long as one doesnt give up ,  then there is hope .
 once u give up ,  the door is shut ,  then it will never happen .
 but dont try too hard too .
 just socialise more ,  join hobby/exercise groups etc and if it happens good .
 if not ,  just let it be .
 it could be that some folks are too comfortable and coddled .
 at the first challenge they give up .
 or maybe there are other deeper emotional issues that are hard to untangle .
 but what would chiu say are the key life lessons that chiu had to learn on your own ?
 thanks for this .
 jordan peterson rocks .
 he talks about parental issues too .
 lots of common sense stuff (that actually takes alot of time and effort to figure out on your own) and great insights in his videos .
 haha aww i think boys need to keep a long leash ba ,  different from girls ,  cannot nag too much .
 maybe can think of man activities that chiu all can do together ,  like biking to see sunrise .
 after chiu all close liao they will open up .
 my parents were poor people who dunno anything about financial planning ,  when the third kid came out things got hard and my dad started to become violent .
 my dad works shift ,  when we play too loudly he will wake up and whack me cause i dont hit back .
 my mother uses me like her stress relief all the time ,  find any excuse to cover my body with cane marks .
 sometimes scald me with hot water ,  and rub chilli padi on my face .
 they dont provide me with any basic necessities ,  until my adult teeth were half rotted away ,  and when i have periods i cant go to school cause there were no pads .
 i had to go out and work at an early age ,  but i made very little money cause i was under educated ,  my dad threatened to throw me out of the window .
 so i moved out of the house and lived with boyfriends .
 thank chiu for your kind words… .
 i will work on it and hopefully when i go study in cheena full time next year can share my success story (if any) 
 actually talking about “feelings” ,  i did ask a girl before what is she looking for in a guy and her answer was “i don’t know i just depend on my feelings and intuition ,  like i must feel comfortable with the guy and let nature takes it course” .
 till today i still don’t understand what she meant  .
 i see others take about standards… .
 my standard of an ideal gf is something like this ,  is my standards too high ?
 women look for height which is way worse than men looking for looks .
 looks u still can work on it .
 height u cant .
 women oni dont  matter looks if u got the height
 then go study part time degree still cannot get the job ,  study for what
 so your 6 month engineering degree course still is still legitimate just that not accredited oni (like who da fuck will believe) ?
 or those that just has a venue to clock time ,  then print chiu a cert still legit not fake or not ?
 mom passing buck to employers to vet their candidates
 dunno why pap gahment terkan local sinkies jialat jialat ,  ,  but bend so far back for the foreigners .
 actually mom did a good job attracting foreign talents .
 first they recognize that talents dont really need authentic degrees to be talents .
 then they created mycareersfuture for foreign talents to see every job available in singapore that will be open to foreigners after 28 days .
 we have the top brains in the pap gahment taking care of sinkies .
 fake verse degree mill ?
 chiu print from your printer ,  thats fake ,  chiu submit your fake resume and pay for a degree (nevermind if chiu do not even know if the  &apos;uni &apos; exist) that printed by someone else printer ,  that not fake ,  aka geniune ?
 and accepted by sinkie gahment organizations ?
 strictly speaking since singapore does not have a central authority of vetting foreign qualifications ,  every foreign qualifications is technically  &apos;unaccredited &apos;
 or like thor movie ,  asgard is where your people are , not a place ,  singapore is a place for foreigners to replace and go ,  not a place for true born sgrean ?
 its real if chiu declare your house is a uni and print your own degree
 leemember this and do the needful when the time comes or else u all are kumgong kiss .
 why they spend so much effort to differniate between forged and mill .
 both are undesirable .
 it oso show the low or non-existence competency level of the job seeker .
 mom recognizes foreign talents .
 there are talents who might not have degrees .
 they are welcome to take up jobs in singapore as they benefit sinkies and improve the lives of sinkies .
 foreigners create jobs for sinkies
 going to uptron nao
 means tons of them oredi working in singapore ,  if we round them up our economy will collapse

 i yhink it is best to extend hbl as long as possible till covid reduce to single digit .
 isnt there psle marking day sandwiched in between ?
 18-21 oct so maciam bo zheng hu for p1 to p5 chewren ?
 bro ,  all die to face and ego .
 those team oyk lw gan cannot afford to do it .
 cos it will tarnish their image n reputation .
 cos countries will view spore s failure .
 cos foreigners will not invest in spore .
 but they screw up big fat time to spread until liddat .
 should extend till the  &apos;experts &apos; know what they are doing
 imagine the situation for the parents .
 oredi at home have to wfh and to oversee the hbl for their children .
 i seen what the children have to go through .
 some sls lessons ,  some quiz after that .
 how many students discipline enough to go through 2-4 hours of these daily without the parents around ?
 right after school opens its sa2 exams .
 imagine the stress .
 i think it &apos;s composition first .
 how to hbl practice on composition ?
 i agree that hbl now would be good for the children to reduce their risk .
 i can oni hope that they consider what the students have to go through during hbl and dont repeat the psle maths standards on p1-5 sa2 .
 marking days no school iirc .
 this coming sa2 i think most students will do badly .
 the entire week of hbl ,  my house wan ,  besides the first day report for 10 min and do nothing ,  oni go through assignment for less than 40 minutes .
 so basically they oni have lesson for 40 minutes a day and totally no science and chinese lesson .
 ever heard of headless chicken ?
 i see my p1 kid .
 the hbl basically can gao tim very fast too .
 and given their attention span ,  very hard to sit thrgh and listen attentively to 1 hour of zoom .
 at best is catch 1/2 or 3/4 of it
 during hbl ,  chers still report to school right ?
 most school p1 no exams .
 think about the p 3 - 5 .
 hbl finish sa2 starts
 i wonder how many pupils will cry in sa2 ?
  but does it matter when covid raging around ?
 that is correct .
 some of the students unable to do hbl cos parents working or infrastructure/hardware buey sai .
 so need to go back to school .
 thereafter teachers need to be around to guide/help .
 not least forgetting some r back to do invigilating duties for the psle .
 straight go into ring of fire liddat .
 aft tt another 4 days free for the psle marking day .
 i see my kid school .
 supposedly arrange again for 2 days of hbl to cover the 1st 2 days of psle marking
 what &apos;s worse is they still change the exams dates for p3-5 .
 last time more apart .
 my guess is the same as most here .
 go back after hbl .
 finish sa2 exam quick quick .
 immediately hbl or stay at home .
 i wont be surprise if thats the case
 if scared of exam ,  just see doctor ask for mc lor .
 recently got the news ,  girl got stomachache ,  doctor say for signs of respiratory infection ,  prescribed pcr ,  the girl ended up being barred from engrish psle .
 got tys model answer liao .
 tell doctor got runny nose ,  can skip all the exams .
 next year psle students will be even more jialat as they will have to catch up on 2 consecutive years of common last topics taken out at p4 and p5
 moi wore ocs instructor t-shirt .

 the thing is chiu are not supposed to return the claypot to the tray return area oso .
 i dont believe stall holder let the cleaner wash their claypot .

 my take is never let female take on any leadership role .
 what a lame approach 
 who pass the law oso must check
 this is like us southern style of eating crayfish ,  lobster etc .
 it came served in a big plastic bag .

 chao angmo stir tiongcock on their national tv !
 jin xiasuay give angmo chance to stir !
 nothing wrong with thick black theory .
 chiu obviously never read enough chinese to understand
 we mock tiong lor .
 just like ,  afghan ,  we mock usa lor .
 how cum dont see this in tiong news ?
 ccp really crazy to let things happen until liddis .
 their face more important than the chinese people
 maybe now they going to spin it and say ,  finally the great ccp is allowing aussie to bring in their coal cos they understand that aussie is losing alot of money and oni the great ccp can save them !
 but then all the ccpibs that last time say ccp target greenhouse emissions thats why off electricity how now ah ?
 lol this is funny .
 really tio self piak
 is back to qing dynasty ,  all the countries take turns to chop carrot roberto .
 this is the state of tiongland under ccp .
 and instead of 200yrs like qing to reach this ,  .
 it oni took ccp 70yrs .
 another chao angmo media starts smearing tiongcock for bowing down to bogans    .
 nobody is talking about emotions here ,  but about interests and privileges ,  or the lack of them when referring to like or dislike .
 when people dislike ceca ,  it &apos;s not about emotions ,  but about how peasants had their lunch stolen .
 if u wan to invest and gain market access ,  mai kpkb about how cheena this n dat ,  this is the price u have to accept ,  to play  by their rules .
 same thing for ceca n india ,  there &apos;s no free lunch in the world .
 going by what u say ,  y u still kpkb online everyday like small boy ?
 n your terrex kena confiscated is your own silper serpent behkan ,  duno laws in other countries
 qxpress always a win for me .
 but sadly sometimes certain item i want oni available on lazada with ninjavan delivery .
 if no cb ,  just go to the shop and buy
 recv the msg that my item coming today but seems like ninjavan took away the map location thing .
 maybe too many complaints why keep circling around in the estate for hours lol .
 edit: i went into my laz app and got the delivered notification .
 open my door and my item is here .
 no other notifications .
 i noticed the shipment label is  &apos;3 day &apos; ,  which means those cheaper shipping items will be lower priority .
 knn the ninjavan really sucks ,  my item still stuck at there .
 i buy one pillow from 6th may until now ninjavan oso dont want go take from the seller .
 picked up on 5th ,  till now not in warehouse .
 wont be surprised if ninjas lost the item .
 claim refund from shopee ?
 my item shipped out on 4th ,  today then come .
 wtf sibei long leh ,  haven update anything yet .
 on the way to warehouse so long
 my urbanfox delivery coming today ard yet my ninja one havent even collect from seller .
 ninja item was ordred at least 2 days earlier .
 i today 1st time bought something on shopee and i saw it &apos;s ninja van (home delivery) .
 i cant find any tracking information on shopee website .
 so how do i track  ?
 at least q10 got tell me step by step info  .
 need to wait awhile for delivery why so impatient 
 and yet they are stil surviving .
 they should shut down like honest bee
 depends on luck ?
 my order came within 3 days .
 qoo10 oso must wait for them to update shipping status .
 i bought something from shoppee .
 delivered by ninja van within 5 days of purchase .
 acceptable ,   considering it is during covid period .
 got sms ask whether i want contactless delivery .
 so i chose to be informed by telegram .
  but never msg me at telegram .
 i happened to be on email and suddenly 1 email pop out my item delivered .
 i check and it was left outside my house .
 but no one inform me .
 huh what item u buy ?
 the moment i qualify .
 hmm not too sure about the effectiveness against all variants part but we will see  
 will do moderna while singing majullah singapura
 are we vaccinated to help them achieve endemic target .
 open the boarders then after about 6 months of effectiveness ,  chiu will need to get booster .
 for now ,  booster may be free but how long will it be free ?
 just like the self test kit ,  first it was free ,  in future ,  chiu will need to pay .
 chiu don’t live here ?
 will take 3rd jab .
 everyday have to go to office via bus interchange and mrt ,  chances of getting covid is high once restrictions are lifted .
 efficacy has dropped to 40% now so really effective or not ?
 of course them ,  i dont associate with the  &apos;white &apos;
 i think given recent history ,  it may be a false choice .
 like chiu can choose either choice a join malaysia or choice b join malaysia .
 (and guess what ?
 we still left malaysia .
 *raises hand* i’’m going for it .
 it’s retarded to think of taking the vaccine as doing someone else a favour .
 it’s primarily for your own good .
 israel white rat eliao .
 americunt is the enxt .
 singapore is the 3rd ?
 chiu hear it here first .
 wan bao notice me .
 please dont go for it guys .
 apes together stronk
 me me me i want to shoot .
 i will tell them save the trouble ,  jab 3 years worth at one go
 antivaxxers are mocking .
  that is cos they live in singapore .
    if they live in malaysia or indonesia ,  they will be begging .
 nobody likes c19 .
  it took the whole of humanity by surprise .
 scientists and all governments ,  not oni our gahment ,  are doing their best to deal with this .
 which is not funny .
  it is really life and death .
  but some people here think it is funny just cos those 25 to 30 people in icu or who need oxygen happened to be not their own mother or grandpa .
 it &apos;s the same thing ,  same mentality .
  road accidents ,  getting crushed by a car ,  oni happen to other people .
 feel like a timebomb .
 its time for him to make a visit to his favorite land of incredibles .
 can oso test if the vaccination works .
 go mumbai slum to have a roadside prata .
 then take a dip in ganges river .
 still ok means vaccine is good .
 now that he is immuned ,  please travel to cecaland to orfishally open up 2 way bubble with nose quarantine needed and enjoy full ceca hospitality over there
 he can work at the infectious diseases  center for few weeks to make sure 100% immunity .
 liddat oso can

 he is a true leader who lead by example .
 ohhhhhhhhh i thought it’s bao jiak from pm msg
 how chiu know about the failed attempt to vaccinate his clone that turned him into an alien monster ,  in a secret facility hidden within the underground ammo dump ?
 another way is he has 5% chance of kena covid .

 2 weeks break is to try someone new and keep ts as spare tire .
 taking a 2 week break lo
 she most likely oredi have someone in mind and she doesn’t see a future with chiu .
 or maybe she look down on chiu but she won’t tell chiu the truth .
 cause she want to preserve your feelings for her for now .
 just dont be the sad fish and send good morning night msgs .
 and post nonsense on yr fb and ig .

 actually pogba lee oso can
 why would anyone hate their sons so much as to give them a footballer name ,  which by the time he grow up ,  it becomes so expired and obiang ?
 wanna name juan .
 but low ses people sure pronounce wrongly
 fts from degree mills >>> local uni grads .
 and key point is mom bo taichi with regards to vetting any qualifications .
 even if fake degree they won’t do or review anything unless companies themselves flag it to them .
 all taichi thrown to companies to bear ,  macam asking hungry tiger to look after a butcher shop
 song bo ,  chao sinkies ?
 i read this i oso damn hot ,  although i no longer work in the corporate world .
 meaning chiu f ucking wasted your life in pursuing degree in ntu/nus .
 and in the end ,  chiu get leeplaced by a ceca with a fake cert !
 ts who did chiu vote for ?
 oso ,  wow how come ft/s pass got minimum wage but sinkies no minimum wage ?
 song bo sinkies ?
 dont even know why mom bother to explain all these fake & degree mills .
 make sinkies even more dulan after reading .
 if u cant convinced them  ,  confused them
 chiu think mom explaining to sinkies ?
 maybe they are more concerned with calming the nerves of our ceca overlords  
 who chiu voted for
 baiying uptron and spu phd now !
 its very clear mom stand at which side .
 ah loong’s 4gee leeders got advertised whole world fake degrees are ok in singapore ?
 i wonder if uk accepts degree mills anot
 the uk does not have the foresight of pap &apos;s manpower policies .
 pap recognizes there are foreign talents that graduated from degree mills who can take up jobs in singapore to benefit sinkies .
 that is why our manpower minister is paid higher than the uk ministers due to capability differences .
 all kinds of nonsense coming out  .
 if ah gong still around ,  sure give all these buggers a piece of his mind .
 hope he gets up from his grave
 farking hate this cuntry
 best part is employers treat abc masters degree that print out in 2 minutes and can get like satki .
 but local sim bachelor need to study 4 years treat like dog ****

 dl dating apps to practice
 i tried all the different dating apps le ,  find them to have 1 .
 super sky high standards or 2 .
 thou alot of bro and sis here have shared their views on dating apps as well .
 seems like there is a need to really sieve through to find one that is genuine .
 am now more focus on working and improving myself first before embarking on full time postgrad studies next year september and hopefully can have a successful love story 
 i c butch with a chio bu jin emo liao
 ah boy u still can say people ?
 i think many people got disillusioned from kpop influence .
 think about this when chiu hit 30 .
 be worried when chiu hit 35 .
 time to decide to remain single when chiu are 45 .
 chiu are so happy managing your life .
 chiu are forever free of attachments  .
 haha maybe my own standard oso quite high bah…but don’t know why so many girls find those kpop guys look good ,  no offence but i don’t get it 
 did chiu read my post on page 13 that i shared with chiu .
 all the answers to her response are there .
 re standards ,  way out of your league if chiu are not a 9/10 yourself .
 every one wants a poster girl gf .
 when older ,  chiu will understand such girls are not attainable or desirable .
 your problems must be good boy character ,  skin too thin ,  cold feet ,  sweaty palms ,  cannot sweet talk and pocket not deep/wallet not fat enough .
 look ,  size and shape help but not compulsory .
 while it is good to gather feedback from girls about how to chase them ,  know what they like ,  etc ,  one hard truth i learned from the convos i have with quite a number of female friends .
 ( not gf) is that girls tend to know what they like but the advices or tips that they give usually dont work unless there is an assumption that they oredi think the guy is up their alley .
 if chiu are using that basis to approach a random girl who chiu found to be your type ,  chances are that chiu will most likely fail to spark her interest with those female tips .
 chiu dont ask the fish how they like to be caught ,  chiu need to talk to the fishermen to understand how to catch them .
 most girls will fall for the same tactics and tricks one .
 chiu oni 23 years old ,  still yang .
 wa why tagged me ?

 i want to tt usd to interactive broker from my uob mighty fx account to their citi us .

 i tried sending sgd then convert to usd in interactive broker but .
 the exchange rate not good and they oso take some fee .
 so looking for alternative
 googled and came across this .

 i thought ibkr xr is good ,  never delve into the differences before .

 i just chop chop transfer ,  convert ,  purchase when i opened up ibkr few years back .
 then switch off the forex from my portfolio lol .
 i try the wise see if worth the effort bo .

 bought 2 items from shopee and delivered by ninja van recently .
 no issues with it .
 dunno why people in here complain like it &apos;s that bad .
 maybe oni the bad deliveries tend to get the most attention .
 items recently all delivered .
 the concerns aired here for their inefficient service .
 customer service non-existance .
 items took 2wks or longer to deliver considering how big is spore .
 its like they oni have 3 stuffs to scan at warehouse and 3 drivers to serve islandwide .
 taking them a week to pick up from seller and 5 days to reach their warehouse .
 oso lost items by them .
 its not like we have much choices or rather any choice during this knnccb period regardless how urgent we need the items .
 want to suck it up must oso look at the situation la .
 i agree with op .
 ninjavan really sucks !
 mine is wait for 1 week then pickup .
 sort one day delivery next day .
 but when pick up need 1 week sia .
 i paid for the delivery man =(
 pick up 1 week then how long to reach their sorting hub or warehouse ?
 this one the last item to be delivered .
 ordered on the 3rd may ,  ninjavan picked up on the 9th and no update .
 still never improve
 ts from which delivery company ?
 i buy alot of stuff from lazada and 95% of the time they assigned me ninja van .
 i never had any issues with them .
 be it delivery box or home delivery or self pick up from buzz/7-11 .
 from my experience with all other companies ,  ninjavan is one of the fastest for cheap/free delivery .
 fastest i ever got was ordered at 10am next day 12pm reach my home oredi .
 free delivery option somemore
 everything they delivered to me so far the packaging is squashed .
 thats the way it is .
 christmas kid syndrome .
 online sports shop
 no news on my ninja delivery after 12 may collection from seller .
 seems like the new normal .
 package left on shoe rack outside door .
 any ahmow ahkow can take it away as it &apos;s in the open .
 can at least call/sms mah .
 i open door he throw inside my flat oso contactless what .
 updates on my previous post .
 first time use shopee delivered via ninja .
 total took 4 days .
 guess im lucky  ?
 departed parcel dropoff counter / box - ing mobile at blk 442 clementi avenue 3 #01-107b .
 successfully picked up from sender - shopee .
 parcel dropped off at parcel dropoff counter / box - ing mobile at blk 442  .
 mine has been picked since 13th may and it &apos;s still not at the sorting centre !
 it seems like they are fast in picking up but then it gets stuck somewhere .
 i have orders from qoo10 ,  shopee and lazada ,  all liddat .
 all ordered last week .
 once picked up no more updates .
 almost all delivery poor management .
 my item now in limbo .
 still better than singpost i guess
 yup same as mine .
 mine got picked up on 14 may and no news after that .
 i wrote in to their support and they called me back ,  even they themselves dunno when it will be processed for delivery .
 i oso have packages constipated somewhere .
 this will be part of the new norm for the foreseeable future .
 looks like i am not the oni one .
 this is f***ed up .
 my item finally came yesterday .
 if chiu have such a vaccine ,  do inform who .
  better still if chiu have a vaccine which is a lifetime &apos;s worth .
 if this is true like what chiu claim ,  please launch the vaccines and request people to took when it can deter the virus and not came out with some half past six vaccines and next request people to took booster vax every 6 month after they are fully vax .
 treating locals as guinea pig and worse ,  let in foreigners from country which has high % of covid and next penalise locals when our cases here surge
 wait for u guys to jab and observe 3 months later .
 by then sp2 sp3 all come out .
 2x jabbing the vaccine for wuhan when it is oni partially effective against delta is like drinking lots of flu medicine for sars .
 i will iv drip the vaccine continuously into my body 24/7 365 days a year .
 next time maybe just a pill !
 did your englishl language teacher in malaysia teach chiu that after  &apos;to &apos; ,  the verb is always in the present tense ?
 what is this  &apos;to took &apos; chiu are writing ,  twice ?
 other than your really embarrassing grammatical mistake ,  the rest of your post had oredi been replied by various other members here .
  please do not repeat the same mindless whining over and over like a broken record .

 i have  &apos;opp &apos; this morning to mingle with someone who does not know that it should be: .
 i suppose he would write: .

 oh yes ,  i am supposed to believe that he earns $20k a month ,  and brings that back to malaysia to become 20k x 3 .
 by the way ,  it is  &apos;did chiu have &apos; .
  not  &apos;did chiu had .

 nowadays still can trust science when it is mixed with political reasons ?
 all are brainless giving stupid ideas .
 go attend more ribbon cutting ceremony for new bus stops and shut the **** up lah
 this shows how disconnected she is with people on the ground .
 most probably surrounded by yes men/women around her who cheer for her every idea .
 this woman is super anti-peasants to come up with stupid laws ?
 ask this hypocrite pap slug to stfu .
 she ownself caught hoarding 3 full tray of eggs during pandemic .
 somemore say sinkies not happy and pack up anytime and leave .
 what abhorrent slug .
 ask her what &apos;s the point of cutting ribbons on temporary bus shelters
 i oredi said before .
 go hong kah eat at hawker center and dont return tray .
 make sure few  hundred turn up
 if chiu really saw her ,  chiu should stand there and openly give her a piece of your mind 30 minutes straight .
 maybe after that ,  she &apos;ll eat her humble pie & stop her nonsense
 not happy ,  she tell chiu to migrate
 which do chiu think is fairer ?
 she migrate or thousands migrate ?
 we the 61% need a good night sleep .
 knowing that chiu ,  your loved ones and next few generations tio pwned ,  makes me happy
 actually my house here the coffeeshop got hire myanmar plate collector and table wiper and they collect the dishes and bowls and tray before i can stand up .
 this ministar just came up with one of the most full retard law in singapore and will be remembered for posterity .
 this kind of people oso can become minister .
 singapore jialat liao .
 so tzechar/claypot/stingray etc with staffs serving food to table ,  but no practise of clearing table in the past how ?
 diner responsibility or hawkers &apos; ?
 her video exposes what a lousy spineless politician these pap turds are  .
 come up with a law ,  just say outright .
  &apos;i dont care if chiu eat during cny & there &apos;s 3 claypots and 5 huge trays and mountain of bones .
 if chiu left a shred on the table ,   i &apos;ll send chiu to jail !
 now ,  just spinelessly say if stalls hire staff ,  need not do .
 so what if staff not hired ?
 basically it means stalls must hire such staff .
 next time chiu should ask the stall outright .
  do chiu have such helpers ?
 if no ,  dont patronize  .
 and this will return to the old days where chiu cannot sit infront of stall if you &apos;re not eating from the stall .
 cos the stall cant be running around whole hawker center looking for the customers eaten trays and plates
 lee bee hwa much much much better than this amy .
 bee hwa fought for chinese med treatments to remain open during covid /  cb
 her face is damn ugly man .
 no wonder need so much makeup .
 this in hawker ?
 i like plain but if the t shirt is expensive kind ,  prefer to the logo to be somewhere but not too obvious
 no brand cos i dont want to be walking advertisement .
 i pay to advertise for them ?
 the brand should pay me instead if their brand is shown on my shirt
 branded but must be discreet , like zuckerberg’s t shirts .
 without the brand .
 plain old hanes ts r best
 without brand too
 good brand must print big big la .
 if not people spend so much for what ?
 usually people who wear logo tees from luxury brand is cos they cant afford to buy other clothes from them but still want to flex .
 scare people dunno .
 if the t-shirt is free from sponsors ,  moi prefer the logos as small as possible .
 if the t-shirt is buy for its brand ,  moi prefer the logos as big as possible for all to see the brand of t-shrt .
 small design if not plain .
 like late apple founder .
 maybe his tshirt from hermes .
 moi saw some people wear supreme shirt .
 u mean like chanel  ,  lv ,  dior n etc ?
 no lego bag not many will buy
 i prefer polo tee with small logo on left breast
 reminded me of guys who like to wear belts of the following brands hermes  ,  ferragamo n lv .
 must have the huge logo buckle
 plain uniqlo t-shirts are comfy and of good quality .
 in fact most of their clothing no visible logo anywhere .
 but then again logo is part of the design mah ,  some nike/superdry/addidas and others  t-shirts with logo have nice designs .
 but those like a/x with no design just the logo is a total waste of money .
 wa so wei da ah .

 really rambling all over the place .
 chiu should take something for your verbal diarrhea .
 half of cheena do not have heating in winter ,  including shanghai this is all along even before the power outages and coal ban .
 cheena is soo poor ,  mao said cheena genes very strong southerners don’t need winter heating ,  so mao drew a line that cut virusland into half ,  northern and southern .
 unfortunately shanghai the city that gets most of its resources fall under the southern line and doesn’t have heating .
 don’t chiu all notice why tiong’s wear thick padded jackets indoors and when they are at home ?
 haha i never ever seen angmo doing that ,  even the poorer angmo like russians ,  serbs ,  belarusian ,  moldovans and albanians .
 everyone else in winter indoors is wear normal 22 degree clothing .
 really shows what a third world country cheena is .
 cheena really not far from its nk roots
 this just means manufacturers will leave cheena .
 china’s manufacturing mostly angmo employers ,  not their own .
 so who do chiu think die first ?
 they are fcked this time .
 and which non-chinese would drink milk from cheena ?
 there are a few la .
 some start with  &apos;i &apos; oso .
 how true is this ?
 t oso  ,  shilling vaxx and meds one haha
 not surprised at all .
 the ships stuck there for months someone need to pay for all the losses .

 i guess a handful of u were right to write this last year: chinas ban on foreign imports like coal wont last long .
 ya i am not surprised by the price .
 but whether the demand is correct i am not sure .
 ccp is rich hor ,  4 times 5 times the price will still pay  
 bro im sorry to hear that .
 i hope all goes well for chiu .

 copyright protected hardwarezone forums app
 when gf say that usually is gone case oredi 
 yeah prehap not the right one ,  we have problems in the past oredi but just make adjustment to accommodate the issue but this adjustment longer it drag out is like just hiding the issue and not making the situation any better in the end .
 gf did say dunno if we have future ,  i oso cannot say for sure so is like just gross over .
 guess she found her new future le
 if u feel relief ,  maybe she and chiu not compatible .
 treat as breakup .
 take this 2 weeks to look for new cai .

 tough call by edmwer ,  ceca or sjw .
 nip the problem in the bud .
 if allow her to stay on oxford student union later become ceca student union ,  and caste system imported into oxford
 looks a little like joey mendoza .
 i see the picture ,  i thought  &apos;she &apos; stepped down cos they found out she &apos;s a he .
 oxford did the right thing .
 they certainly don’t want to get “villaged” .
 this one is student or the admissions office auntie ?
 holy fark thats one fugly looking piece of shiat
 she racist against jews and discriminate trans first then cry victim she kena lynched~~ .
 oxford did the right thing .
 if no action taken .
 who knows one day she might introduce caste system in oxford student union~~
 ironically ,  partly why she won might be cos she is part of the  &apos;diverse minority group &apos; .
 like shoot her own ticket that got her in sia .
 shows that ceca like are the tiongs .
 both cannot be trusted
 how come look like 42 instead of 22 ?
 casmir is the one
 i will name my kids names with the abbreviation lky .
 chiu see the badminton player lky oso very zai .
 is have no intention
 can name jesus .
 anyone who puts in van ,  mac or der in a name is prtetty dumb .
 check out the meaning .
 the dutch use van to mean son of same for mac in scotland .
 it &apos;s alright to name children after famous people ,  for example cristiano ronaldo is named after ronald reagan .
 pierre png is named after justin trudeau &apos;s father who was oso canadian .
 pele is very common name for africans .
 quite common spanish name but it &apos;s pronounced hey sus .
 nobody calls then jesus .
 likewise nobody names their son judas
 in sinkieland confirm kena pronounced as jesus .
 we have a beckham liao lor ,  not surprised to see more funny names come up  .
 theres a thread yesterday abt a funny name oso ,  appear on tv some more
 will oni give my children dialect names .
 so far brought quite a number of items and are delivered by ninja .
 did they promise chiu how long the item will be delivered ?
 lucky bro ,  mine still on the van since 14 may .
 order 2 items from sls  .
 it took more than than something i ordered from newegg to reach me .
 ninjavan damn good ah
 picked up on 14th may .
 processed 19th may .
 say will be delivered by 20th may but i not keeping my hopes up .
 this period of time my delivery not even in singapore .
 hopefully chiu guys get your delivery this week .
 seems like ninjavan working with too many platforms has become their achilies heel .
 my qoo10 order despatched yesterday ard arrived today .
 bought youguth probiotics on mon evening ,  which came yesterday noon too .
 but not sure which courier coy .
 my order took j&t express 2 days to deliver .
 the other order still with ninja .
 ninjavan now for local oni delivery takes 6 days .
 i ordered ssd via lazada and pet food via shopee last thurs ,  the two were delivered oni tonight .
 my shopee purchase took more than 1 week to deliver after seller handed my orders to them .
 all the other couriers have no problem sameday or next day delivery .
 must be ninjavan lowball their couriers ,  now all jump ship .
 good luck guys ,  their couriers are probably left with that few left who lazy to switch over to earn more money .
 it &apos;s a sinking ship .
 finally today received my parcel ordered on 28th april via shopee .
 ordered created 29th april .
 pickup 16th may  .
 reached warehouse 20th may .
 delivered 21st may
 i still dont received !
 u want to receive fast ,  ask for express la .
 those shopee ,  lazada ,  etc use normal unless u pay more .
 amazonsg is excellent .
 prime membership give free express delivery for oni 3 dollars a month .
 i placed my order at 6pm yesterday oni .
  oh yeah amazonsg oso has food .
 not like primenow where need min $40 dollars for free delivery .
 ordered just a pack potato chip and it is being delivered free   .
 hari raya coming thats why all cheong things isit  !
 my package oso the same .
 every day put estimate delivery date is today but never come .
 ninjavan seems to pick up more quickly if it &apos;s not a lazada or shopee order .
 maybe they earn more .
 but delivery still as slow .
 wow ,  ninjavan truly suck !
 i got an sms on friday informing me that my order would be delivered that day ,  pretty upset that it didnt turn up .
 add to that fact is that i didnt receive and sms from ninjavan or its driver/deliveryman to inform me of any delay .
 i understand that perhaps they are faced with overwhelming delivery orders ,  but a simple call or sms would have ,  at least ,  soothe my anger and frustration .
 best part is ,  chiu cant contact them as some of their contacts or email do not exist anymore ,  and chiu cant call them as they are supposedly working from home .
 hope my ninja van parcel get delivered today ,  received sms the morning .

 cos silver serpents are dafty ,  rigid minded and can oni rely on 10 years series .
 who u voted for
 this was introduced by lim swee say .
 same generation as ah loong .
 our new 4g mom is much better ,  nobody asked her for any apologies for cok ups before .
 u guys voted for this .
 lim swee say will forever be remembered for his cheaper better faster motto .
 this is the reason for singapore &apos;s success .
 talents with degree-mill / fake degrees are still talents and it is no surprise they are cheaper ,  better ,  and faster .
 they benefit sinkies when we create jobs for them in singapore .
 cant believe that this yeendian bs is stuffed down our throats & at the expense of our livelihoods too knn .
 this came out when they are protecting that filthy snake called nisha la .
 degree mill oso can come singapore work ah
 local uni grad sibei song sia .
 mug books for 4yrs .
 school fee 40k+ and will be in debt if take loan .
 when graduate at a disadvantage position cos ft win them by experience
 the 2 years in ns is a privilege for sinkie citizens to protect the lives of sinkies and foreigners working and living in singapore .
 based on our world class education system ,  i am sure our graduates can catch up to our foreign talents with their intelligence and capabilities despite being behind 2 years and needing to serve 10 years of reservist obligations .
 61% voted for it .
 now kpkb for pap inaction .
 many sinkie just feel unfair where ceca have the shortcut n cheating element in them .
 sadly sinkies is being disadvantaged ,  like being handicapped by ns ,  much longer years of  &apos;quality study &apos; ,  paying so much for studying but many foreign students got it free ,  etc .
 next generation will suffer
 i am not scholar .
 any recommendation which degree mill to get  ?
 feel like a kum gong to spend $ and time to study in a local uni
 so good salary .
 quality of grads from those degree mills can fight with our local uni or poly standard anot ah ?
 why need to fight ?
 just see the monthly salary la .
 so teh education system here wrong liao mah in this case  ?
 sinkies should just encourage their kids all to go through teh faster degree mill way .
 work smart notch hard right in this 5g era
 the fact imda did not purge the spu grads out means they are thoroughly compromised or dont care liao .
 people forget her famous quote liao asking u all f off if not happy in sg
 these are alaskan crabs .
 quite expensive ,  this meal .
 what kind of mp is she ?
 more concerned about trivial matters instead of looking for ways to prevent her constituents from getting covid .
 how about mookata ?
 mookata , steamboat and tzechar gahment alrdy clarify liao mah .
 these must employ extra staff to clear their plates(increasing their cost) .
 while they are at it they should fine people that leaves tissue paper to chope tables as well .
 just categorise it under table littering .
 oh ya 1 sept coming and the new law will kick in
 we will be starting the advisory period for table littering enforcement at coffeeshops and food courts from november this year .
 similar to the approach taken at our hawker centres ,  diners at coffeeshops and food courts will be reminded by safe distancing ambassadors and officers from the singapore food agency (sfa) to clear tables of dirty trays ,  crockery and litter after their meals .
 enforcement will start from 1 january 2022 .
 i met with coffeeshop and food court operators yesterday to address some of their concerns about implementing tray and crockery return infrastructure .
 we had a fruitful discussion on some key points ,  including how they can tap on the national environment agency (nea)’s clean tables support scheme to co-fund such infrastructure .
 we oso clarified that for premises with dining models such as tzechar and mookata ,  operators may continue to get stall assistants or cleaners to assist in collecting the bulky crockery after diners finish their meals .
 nonetheless ,  diners still have the responsibility to clear the rest of their table litter ,  such as used tissues or bones .
 i oso emphasised the need for operators to adopt a revised table-cleaning workflow ,  where cleaners focus on sanitising tables and clearing the tray return points in an efficient manner ,  instead of clearing tables .
 this has worked well at hawker centres thus far ,  and will enable a faster turnover of tables during peak mealtimes ,  benefiting operators ,  diners and cleaners alike .
 thanks to the operators who joined us for the discussion ,  and for their cooperation to implement tray and crockery infrastructure at their premises .
 we will continue to support the operators in their efforts to do so .
 together ,  we can keep our public dining places hygienic and safe .
 i think 5 years down the road ,  all diners have to clear ,  wash and return the plates cleanly to the stalls .
 penalty will be imposed if the returned plates are found not clean properly .
 this is to reduce the needs of cleaners and enable faster turnover during peak period for eg: enough plates and utensils .
 guys your all vote her in .
 dont want to see u guys complain .
 she is just doing the job that she is appointed to do .
 since when coffeeshop got keep plate law .
 chiu want all diners to bring their own cutlery and utensils oso ?
 that is a great suggestion .
 i remember i brought mine when i was in primary school .
 she is appointed to take care of her constituents ,  isit ?
 she &apos;s appointed to wayang and to show off her extensive collection of non medically approved masks
 stupid to the max .
 last time oso got employ cleaners to clear table mah !
 same logic what ?
 must clear immediately ?
 even got delicated staff oso cannot do everything immediately if got alot of customers la !
 gahment really everything oso double standards .
 so does it mean cze zhar and steamboat stall dunnid or pay a lower cleaning fee
 history repeats itself .
 tiongs get humiliated again .
 this time by supposedly white trash angmos .
 immune against covid 19 .
 but not cancer  .
 immue or not ,  one has to die eventually 
 at most 95% oni .
 why need to travel till  that far .
 he can  just go msian ,   everyday 4000+ cases
 lhl can now walk around without mask .
 no virus will be able to penetrade into his body .
 knife ,  gun ,  virus all cannot hurt him anymore !
 he can live in workers dorm for afew months with ft ,  he will still not be infected .
 95% effective leh
 he can now give angpow to his mp/pg supporters without mask !
 he can now keep his job and go travel
 our mission to protect our masters shall continue !
 it will immediately be classified as secret .
 anyone leak will disappeared .
 can the doctors oso look at me for 30mins after the vaccination ?
 chio female doctors oni !
 should oso kiss them
 he’s invincible now .
 make sure his armpit not sweating .
 waiting for him to bcums x-man 
 he need another 5% more .
 need another vaccine to cover this 5 percent to be immune
 on one hand ,  say pandemic of the unvaccinated ,  on the other hand we are reading about a mall with almost 100% staff vaccinated and 80% of population vaxxed but 90% less foot traffic  .
 idk who they trying to bluff .
 feels more like a pandemic of the vaccinated at this point .
 jab liao believe life will go back to normal ,  in the end still same .
 how come your title says 246 .
 while the chart in the article says 254 ?
 massage until blur ah
 the most dangerous place is actually the safest place .
 gng bugis junction tomorrow !
 chiu check with straits times lor lol .
 160 standard is liddat ba .
 just pretend we never see 254 then hehehe
 even the vaxxed are avoiding the mall .
 maybe avoiding death or hospitalisation not enough for them .
 surprised still got 10% left
 surprised still got people go bugis .
 who are these brave 10%  ?
 whatever chiu need to get from bugis ,  chiu can get it somewhere else .
 the moment i read “pandemic of the unvaccinated” i was oredi thinking ,  “wtf logic is this ,  doctor ?
 almost 100% of staff vaccinated ,  still want to say simi pandemic of the unvaccinated ?
 is the pap now trying to keep mum on where the clusters are forming ?
 it seems to me pap is doing a bait and switch to allow more foreigners into singapore ,  especially from their favourite country india to get jobs in singapore .
 this 10% maybe will be gone soon too .
 ask them sell cai png better .
 didnt expect common flu or dengue can cause so much drop in business .
 i thought endemic leow ?
 chiong arrrr bugis now but why your gong got cum one ?
 going bugis junction nao
 is this guy spreading wrong information ?
 i thought vaccinated people have same viral load as unvaccinated ?
 why did he say they will have very mild disease ?
 dr leong hoe nam ,  an infectious diseases specialist from the rophi clinic ,  said the surge in cases at the mall could be cos it was located at a busy intersection of two mrt lines .
  &apos;consistently ,  individuals who have been vaccinated would have very mild disease ,  &apos; he said ,  pointing out that among the thousands of vaccinated individuals who had fallen ill with covid ,  oni one elderly patient had died .
 edmwers can sleep well tonight
 not qualified for the 3rd shot leh 
 who will start a new thread and recruit all the siao cocktail vaccines jab collectors ?
 lai lai wen wen jiak bee hoon or wen wen jiak beijing roasted duck ones please come in and join the vaccines cocktail league .
 2 jabs max for me .
 next if want oso is take the oral tablet
 no need to ask who &apos;s going .
 we &apos;ll be forced to go ,  otherwise get labelled as unvaxxed and privileges revoked
 every 6 month can take mc ,  1 box of  masks and hand sanitizer .
 i going for it .
 but must be free k .
 fool me once ,  shame on you; fool me twice ,  shame on me​my kukujiao size is still same 
 looks like they are opening up to the rest of the word by end of the year 
 by the time booster rate go up higher ,  time for 4th jab liao .
 if it’s the same vaccine that’s not as effective against new variants ,  what’s the point ?
 if it’s new formula vaccine then worth considering .
 going by this logic vax spread virus means double responsibility ?
 me ,  i jab pfizer ,  moderna ,  sinovac ,  sinopham liao .
  ,  today just took booster shot for pfizer ,  feel great and immune against covid
 dont chiu think very funny ,  why no one ask the god they believe and ask the gahment ?
 all gahment are lead by humans oni not god .
 means got wear 2x underwear la .
 singapore people still stuck in 2020 mah .
 my turn should be next year for 6mths period
 havent even take 1st le
 80% 2nd jab is to open for germany/brunei .
 3rd jab is to open to the world while sinkies are still mostly trapped in singapore .
 our lousy neighboring countries all still struggling to get vaccinated
 the front liner go 1st like doctor nurse teacher lecturer .
 cant wait to pak and show my 3rd badge !
 i feel the local hawker scene has been upgraded into some artistic flair tier .
 a few hawkers i see when fried carrot cake or noodles got dramatic stance like kungfu experts .
 this is really a step in right direction !
 as long as it tastes good
 if no queue maybe can afford to do stunts .
 if got queue where will have time ?
 it’s good to show pride in their work
 usually the real good food comes from the hawkers who dont spend their energy doing all the wayang and social media .
 they put their heart and soul into the food instead .
 look like playing more then cooking .
 fire keep burning food inside oso not cooked outside chao tar .
 pattern more than badminton
 got diploma ,  degree or masters in culinary .
 dont play play .
 hawkers oso must innovate to stay relevant with times .
 yeah definitely too hard ,  9/10 .
 hard to maintain unless chiu high ses ,  earn big income ,  provided chiu get the gal in the first place .
 even in one of the recent chinese dating shows i watch ,  at best the gal is 8/10 .
 and it was hard enough to get the girl .
 oso ,  notice all her pics are high life .
 restaurant + dining at skyscraper = high maintenance .
 let me show chiu what is realistic ,  for me .
 i will use singapore girls wearing specs as an example since i wear it most of the time .
 first gal will par with me in looks right now ,  if chiu want i can pm chiu my pic for comparison lol .
 second gal will be a bit beyond my reach for now ,  once i improve over time ,  might be able to secure .
 third gal is out of my reach ,  will be lucky to have since bordering the spectrum between chase/don &apos;t chase .
 last gal is totally out of my reach ,  wouldnt try for sinkie gal .
 maybe overseas girl ,  but would be hard mode still .
  > second gal .
 to keep the comparison simple ,  i use singapore gals instead of foreign bu to compare .
 no need height .
 chu need personality .
 guys just need be cheehong can liao .
 more cheehong ,  sweet talk and con-fidence gets chu zhabors .
 lol it means literally that .
 girls go with how they feel .
 if they feel like they like chiu ,  you &apos;re set .
 if they feel like they dont like chiu ,  game over .
 it &apos;s not rational .
 it &apos;s like how i cant reason with chiu to like a car .
 but i can design the car to appeal to what chiu like .
 so the question is ,  what can chiu do to get them to feel that they want to get closer to chiu ?
 thats a whole book by itself .
 clue: being a nice guy and throwing money doesnt help .
 too many guys go on and on about the girls they like .
 thats not worth discussing .
 chiu like her ,  case closed .
 what matters is whether the girl likes chiu ,  and how chiu get there .
 those girls are very pretty .
 pretty girls have a long line of guys chasing them .
 there &apos;s no reason why chiu cant find get with someone liddat .
 but chiu are starting from a disadvantage as chiu mention chiu are awkward around girls .
 your competition will include guys like mly who are confident and fun and just go chat the girls up and befriend them .
 chiu are oredi tall .
 chiu can get ripped and get a good job and all that is in your favour .
 these are the door openers .
 and then chiu can sharpen your social skills and your game ,  which is the killer app .
 learn from guys like mly - guys who are comfortable around women .
 watch how they behave and act accordingly .
 and you &apos;ll be surprised how much material there is on the net ,  though you &apos;ll have to distinguish the wheat from the chaff .
 to be honest ,  based on how chiu describe yourself ,  i dont think chiu can get those girls today except by luck .
 and after that chiu will have a hard time keeping them .
 but if chiu put in the work ,  just like anything else ,  chiu will get there .
 i prefer girls without specs .
 ladies do not wear specs for their wedding
 this is my type  .
 consider hard to chase not ?
 cheerful look and enjoy eating
 in term of visuals i will give 4th > 3rd > 2nd > 1st ,  with 4th being slightly better than 3rd and 2nd being slightly better than 1st .
 i can match first gal in looks ,  but whether the gal want ,  is another topic of discussion .
 so not too far off ,  anyways visual ranking is subjective ,  aint meant to be objective .
 just wanted to draw a realistic point of comparison for ts ,  since he focusing on idealistic 9/10 girl .
 chiu like the prettiest girl .
 just go up to her and talk to her .
 you &apos;ll be surprised .
 the key part is to be totally cool about it .
 is her watch branded ?
 is her bag branded ?
 i cant tell if she got highlights in her hair ,  now looks like single color ,  if so she is quite sensible with money .
 she oso have light make up on ,  but no manicure on her nails .
 i think she is presentable but not high maintenance .
 i dont think she is the instagram whore type .
 just 1 pigture thats all i can say la .
 u sic me your pigture and stats ?
 i don’t know this is from app one .
 pm u later for tele exchange no idea how send in inbox .
 we have similar childhoods .
 i was belted and beaten often .
 cane marks all over my body were weekly occurances .
 they depended on my dad &apos;s business .
 thrown out of house .
 starved for days .
 drowned in water .
 my mom often fought to protect me and both parents ended up on the floor shoving ,  pushing and screaming at each other .
 it was chaotic .
 mom herself was a gambling addict so she was not home most times .
 this kind i will just swipe left ,  too high maintenance for a low salary bbfa like me .
 even if get together ,  sure will break up
 which era were chiu born in ?
 looks similar to what i am interested in whom i am going out with .
 damn next time try to get one on the train
 for my experience  .
 bob hair and a bit chubby  .
 shoulder length hair smiling with closed eyes .
 noobdriver one is very close to my ideal kind of female outlook
 who the heck these girls .
 1st and 2nd girls like fook
 self pity comes across as lack of confidence .
 once u stop pitying yourself ,  stop judging yourself and start enjoying and appreciating yourself ,  u will automatically become more attractive .
 and even if u dont get anyone interested in chiu ,  u will be generally happier .
 best option still buy buy n eat at home
 meaning dinners better dont leave but ensure the tables plates etc being cleared first .
 nowadays i eat at home more .
 very sick of this policy .
 at night after work want to enjoy a good meal still have to fear of getting fined .
 there are still some coffeeshops which are very hard to find the shelves .
 i asked the hawkers they told me to leave it on the table .
 the cleaners will clear .
 but still ,  as chiu know ,  there is still this fear lurking in me .
 but as soon as i saw that there were some tables that were uncleared i felt better and i just left my bowls and trays on the table and left .
 what i am afraid of is dine in and totally forget to clear tray n get $300 fine .
 sometimes our mind thinking of others .
 did she walk into chernobyl and come back become lile this ?
 ntu president is ceca .
 why he song song take so high pay
 lol cry father cry mother liao .
 snake jiu si snake .
 good thing step down fast .
 will oni happen in cecapore .
 pappies welcum them with open leg poleecy .
 some foreigners used ching chang to mock the ch .
 as lion dance noises .
 as devious as she looks
 subra suresh is an indian-american biological engineer ,  materials scientist ,  and academic administrator .
 on 1 january 2018 ,  he was inaugurated as the fourth president of singapore &apos;s nanyang technological university .
 no sinkie wanna be president .
 million dollar salary .
 meanwhile angmo country student union unpaid job oso tio shoot
 cece scum and trash
 if she &apos;s in singapore ,  she will be forgiven and given a 2nd chance one .
 cos here ,  the gahmen is this boh yong .
  and the people are this boh bian .
 oredi spreading in mrt ,  buses ,  etc  .
 face up to it mtf .
 tell us about it two months ago .
 or else shut up la .
 it is like telling us that chiu will get wet if chiu stay outside during a shower .
 no circuit breaker no talk .
 i thot covid no ez link card .
 the person who passed covid the ezlink card own up .
 they nay surf edmw .
 here oredi forecast long ago .
 plus ,  experts creditability is on fire .
 why expert nay say before mtf open up leh ?
 it was pretty obvious this was gonna happen
 new ezlink variant found
 experts why scare ?
 now it &apos;s the time to ban taking buses .
 these experts are very wols ,  edmwers oredi predicted months ago that this will happen .
  &apos;this was not unexpected &apos;
 cb la these experts .
 anyone with common sense will oso know .
 i can tell chiu why there are so many unlinked and untraceable cases .
 viruses are spread most easily via body fluids and those ah peks like to spit and urine everywhere in toilet .
 i can surely tell chiu some of the unlinked cases got infected from public toilets .
 esp those open air coffee shops which dont have tt check in ,  it is one big loop hole and totally untraceable
 usually bus captain are very tight on shift .
 oni 10 min break cos not enough people drive bus .
 now they are infected .
 who is driving the bus or the 2 min air exchange is good enough
 no need expert oso know all this la .
 edmwers dont have job .
 they oso predict earth will collapse next week .
 trump trump trump !
 hope he &apos;s back for 2024 !
 i think tray return ambassador should wear like sailor moon girl .
 chiu all agree boh .
 go hawker centre or anime fest ?
 this call innovative lar
 is the ts insane ?
 so that we can tell ceca we love them deep deep mah
 weat cat bunny ears or show cleavage .
 sure will return tray one .
 how can employ sia zhen zhen also
 the business will be good correct boh .
 just wear apron and nothing else
 those who dont return knock it down and sign extra
 the uniform for tray return ambassador
 moi think they should just help the cleaners to return the tray for them instead .
 wear sailor moon uniform got what use .
 now covid too many orders or the rate per order too low so delivery man have to take on many orders to make more money .
 sian bought from wrong platform .
 should have ordered from the same seller from qoo10 .
 qxpress seems to be coping ok .
 my shopee order using ninjavan now really bottle neck
 ninja always pull this kind of ninja stunts .
 still ask sinkies suppork locals  .
 when they sucks and ducks responsibility .
 the ninjas in my area dont ever knock the door one dky .
 lucky i dont buy perishables .
 recently ordered something .
 ninja van tracking app kept postponing the estimated delivery date .
 then send me email item lost in transit .
 oredi spoken to their customer service previously & is useless as evident in the eventual lost mail .
 but fortunately ,  just after 2 days of failed delivery ,  i chatted with the seller & eventually seller  suggest to me to cancel the purchase & ask for refund .
 he then personally delivery the item to me foc next day .
 really thankful to this seller as i need the parts to troubleshoot my pc .
 by the way ,  even after i cancelled with shopee ,  ninja van still updated their eta for 1 week more before posting item lost in transit .
 a bunch of jokers they are .
 wa sian ,  means my order picked up on 30th may ,  wont arrive anytime soon zzz
 do they usually deliver by estimated delivery date ?
 mine was picked up today and est arrival is today-tomorrow 10pm .
 looks too good to be true
 sigh guess it &apos;s really too good to be true ,  was looking forward to this delivery ,  thanks for the reply anyway
 those sms are damm bs la .
 u can even recv sms for 2 to 3 days and they dont deliver .
 worst idiot delivery company .
 there is a chat feature in the faq .
  but then again they are basically useless
 has your item reached the warehouse or sorting hub ?
 same ,  just stated pickup until now havent start the inbound scan .
 means might not be in the warehouse .
 hopefully not lost or stolen ,  if oni there is a pickup option i would have do it myself
 anyone has recent delivery experience with ninjavan particularly with shopee ?
 how many working days does it take from pickup to arrival at sorting hub and to delivery ?
 just the other day i saw a ninja van speeding on normal road .
 driver still smoking smoking and drive with 1 hand some more
 think shopee and laz finally buay tahan ninjavan and start to offer more options for last mile courier .
 starting to see alot of local listings on shopee use jt express or speedpost economy as default delivery mode instead .
 last week i purchased a smartwatch on shopee from local seller where order was placed on thursday morning and delivered to door the following afternoon by speedpost .
 seriously ,  never can go suck balls and i hope covid hit their business 9696 .
 today bought an item on lazada ,  seller wanted to deliver my item using ninja an and told me wait 3 to 6 days for delivery .
 told seller i want item by today else i wont buy .
 in the end seller used lalamove and items was delivered within 2 hours .
 had to pay more for delivery but i dont mind .
 ninja van really rubbish company .
  cannot cope with the demand then stop taking in parcels .
 even “smaller” businesses like f&b knows how to stop taking in delivery order on grabfood if they cannot meet the demands .
 this ninja van rather hoard all the parcels than to provide reliable and quality service .
 they fail at the very basics of logistic company which is to provide reliable tracking .
 my parcel still on route to sorting hub ,  i think can reach the moon liao .
 my parcel was delivered quite fast la ,  3 working days  .
 but they didn’t press doorbell or sms when they deliver  .
 they just slot it in the gap between my gate and door .
 knn what if i’m not home ?
 it’s not even hidden .
 someone can just come and take it from between the gate leh
 lim swee say now retired liao .
 collecting pension every month .
 sinkie pays for it
 some people really have intent to mislead stir and incite hatred  .

 she will be better and its all ts fault etc .
 dont let her have the upper chance .
 let her chua sai and move on !
 yeah got issue ,  just that make adjustment to accommodate but issue never resolve ,  just hiding behind and maybe explode in future .
 haha i am the one trying to accommodate her and does get tiring .
 sad will be sad as have being together for awhile but perhaps is for the best
 this 1 if cum bk oso confirm cum with brown or black oyster  !
 worse case scenario ,  like 1 of my friend in teens years ,  kena std for real his gf who came bk for real a month  &apos;break &apos;    .
 (she even denies it !
 ts ,  trust me ,  let her go .
 i was in your shoes before .
 initially the feeling was like hell .
 after i got to hang out with friends and hobby ,  i have a much better life .
 get to ons a few girls .
 thats life man
 this type of woman just full of rubbish .
 tell her u kena toto 1st prize oni can share with her within 1 week period .
 see what &apos;s her reaction .
 listen to all the chao sinkies edmwers bbfas and uncles here .
 we wont harm u one .
 jokes and talk cack aside .
 edmw has one of the most honest advice help here .
 alot of us in our younger days all kena this kind of - 2 weeks break/non contact/rest /coling down period ******** .
 the poor guy gong gong give her peace and cooling off .
 while she everyday go out with that new guy .
 sad truth is by tomorrow or even now .
 poor ts will wait at her block downstairs just like a sad fish .
 finish your rice and dont look back ts  !

 like a sad fish !
 every min see her last seen whatsapp time etc
 2 weeks break to have sex with other guys .
 after that if the guys dont want her then she will come back to u .
 i think is oredi dead chess .

 ts just trolling la .
 bbfa where got gf ?
 fxxk oredi or not ?
 if yes ,  then cut loss and move on .
 if not ,  reflect on why so stupid never fxxk  .
 move on to the next relationship and must ensure fxxk within first three date .
 have sex first .
 with accuracy of 99 .
 just became plan b .
 becoming a plan b getting free sex isnt bad at all .
 still better than bbfa
 such thing is silly .
 a married couple do not say they need a 2 weeks temporary divorce .
 i am not able to understand such man willing to give a pause on a relationship .
 if she needed space to be alone ,  understand the situation and assist in ways that chiu can .
 talk like an adult .
 but not let &apos;s have a 2 week break in this relationship .
 but then again ,  came across men willing to accept back the women despite having been creampied by different men and had not touched that ****y for an extended period of time .
 heng i bbfa ,  oni need to worry about what dish to eat next .
 there’s nothing at bugis junction except mcdonalds and muji .
 this place is stuck in the 2000s .
 covid is the best for killing irrelevance in sinkieland .
 very nice data ,  hope they keep it up ,  let &apos;s break 500
 then plaza sing for 3 lines wor
 too bad they didnt work as politicians  .
 recession still got job and still can draw v high salary
 in short ,  u vaxxers are getting 2 x needle jabs to get the right to eat at restaurants .
 vaccine doesnt do sh1t
 uncle at 1:07 said singapore control very good .
 so waiting for rental rebate or pull out ?
 how come those pro vax people didnt go support the business ?
 jab oredi should have confidence in the jab mah .
 how come business can drop so much ?
 kung flu cant be eliminated ,  just like common cold and flu have been around since dawn of day .
 no longer a new normal ,  it &apos;s normal .
 bugis junction is a safe place but the authority/moh can make the place safer to conduct compulsory regular mass testing to ensure all tenants ,  their staff ,  the intercontinental hotel staff ,  hotel guests ,  etc are not being infected with covid strain/s ,  etc .
 thought it was closed now
 say everyone will kena covid ,  say to live with covid .
 say to vaccinate .
 everyone vaccinate with the false pretense that it will give immunity ,  it will prevent spread and infection .
 now act like big hoohaa ,  why even bother reporting ?
 just another flu need to report ?
 dont even know get entire nation to vaccine for what ?
 thought is endemic stage ?
 vaccinated for the national experiment .
 still got california gym there .
 just like guinea pigs in the lab need to be jabbed & tested .
 sibei songs sleep well tonite
 i pity whoever eat your cooking .
 finally not highly processed food .
 i’m making sesame oil ginger pork with tau kau for dinner too .
 tau kua is good .
 chiu happi can oredi  .
 wtf…… chiu should eat better la… .
 i will take it until the day that i die .
 have faith in pap !
 better 10 shots at once so that no need jab for next 5 years .
 must create a thread for vaccine cocktail siao on garang edmwers liao .
 mayb few years later can see the side effects liao with all the so many repeating jabs dont have to wait long
 end of day clinics & hospitals huat gao gao
 i will go for it
 i will request to jab all at once so no need go back anymore .
 the narrative to dupe ordinary sinkies to vaccinate in order for  &apos;vaccine passport &apos; is misleading & untrue .
 the true reason is to open singapore up to the whole world to come .
 5min29sec in the video tells the actual reason .
 not interested in any booster jab
 thats needed too as sinkieland will sink if oni rely on sinkies .
 other countries cant open up as their vaccinated rates are too low
 and i believe its under reported
 i though they got some magic pill that can cure covid
 no 1mil deaths no scare .
 heng not 400k case per day .
 this omicron not mild at all .
 do not take it lightly .
 as infection & reinfection speed up ,  more will die .
 constant infection will die one .
 less than 10% of their record daily cases .
 declared amount x 100
 their herd immunity not working ?
 as much as 1st/2nd gals not very good looking ,  chiu can try getting one lor .
 see whether chiu have better luck lmao .
 3rd/4th dunnid to say liao ,  i would not be bbfa if i can get them lolol .
 this not meant to kym thread ,  so just showing some realistic comparisons
 i wouldnt even want this kinda sheet standard of girls .
 i pcc more better got more ownself satisfaction than having these 2 fugly girls to be seen with me outside throw my face embarrass me lanjiao tell them go n die better
 nah ,  not how i &apos;d look at it mate .
 anyway ,  your life ,  your choice .
 enjoy your pcc life then 
 be cocky/funny around them .
 tease them like chiu would a little sister .
 wait for when their to eyes open up .
 yes ,  it &apos;s easier said than done .
 best is to watch pros in action .
 it can be done ,  the trick is not to come across as a creep .
 chiu need to be able to read the girl to see if she is open to begin with .
 u wanna stick with fugly girls ?
 hi @troublechocolate15 long time no see
 appearance in the eyes of the beholder ,  your visual choice different from mine .
 i am not as particular about looks at long as i can find someone matching .
 not long time no see .
 i have been lurking just don’t post much
 no one owes chiu anything .
 chiu got the make the best of out any situation ?
 actually it may not be a bad thing to not have dated before .
 i have a friend who never dated before till he was 30+ .
 but he thought about exactly what he wanted in a partner and is very clear abt what he wants .
 so when he started dating someone ,  he was clear she was the one and they got engaged in less than a year .
 so i think doesnt matter whether chiu evergreen or not .
 all that matters is to take care of yourself ,  then think abt the qualities of a partner that chiu want/need .
 wait for it to come instead of looking for it .
 this type go on date each time sure have to spend minimum $100-200 .
 don’t anyhow say leh .
 so satki first gf become first waifu 
 yes ,  i am very sure .
 just look at the foods on the table !
 that meal for 2 persons + drinks easily cost up to $80 .
 then go for movie on weekend ,  2 tickets oredi how much ?
 yes i think this is really important .
 actually the third girl “was” a quite close friend of my but then she sorta grew distant after that one night that i really opened up to her with my insecurities and how i keep judging myself and seeking validation .
 i think just like chiu say girls prefer guys who are emotionally strong i guess .
 alot of chao sinkies mens are wussies .
 u see everyday u walk outside u know oredi .
 chiu never heard of separation meh .
 temporary or otherwise .
 that’s the break for married couples
 one dunnid to be in a relationship to get free sex .
 men should stop putting women on a pedestal .
 there are just as many female cheaters as there are male cheaters .
 one who acts innocent and chaste can be the most kinkiest fiend .
 fool me once  ,  shame on me .
 all humans love attention  .
 married or single .
 every guy and gal all love attention ,  esp from opposite sex
 hard truths la ,  not i want suan u .
 dont be blindsided by 1 ****y and go on your knees like dog and hope to have her back when she open her leg big big for other guys liao .
 oso if u going to start looking for new r/s ,  please cast net wider .
 sometimes ,  ft girls really better than singapore girls .
 move on ,  chiu have becomes plan beta .
 ts so long never reply .
 means he sure go and wait at her block liao .
 no matter what happens don’t do foolish stuff
 this is the truth ,  she basically applying no pay leave from the relationship to go for familiarisation with another guy .
 even if come back is .
 ruined piece of meat liao
 nah ,  more like i get some head up on what probably is happening ,  not going to look for her these 2 weeks
 chances are shes taking the 2 weeks to spend time with the new one she has oredi found .
 if no good ,  2 weeks later go back to ts .
 no matter what ,  dont go stalk at her block .
 or send good morning night msgs
 2 weeks later this is what gng to happ .
 all the bros and uncles can vouch oso .
 she will say - these 2 weeks without me  ,  u are ok oso .
 or she will say these 2 weeks .
 u should more or less know whats gng on .
 or she will say - there is a new guy and we can still be friends .
 isnt it the obvious and waste of 2 weeks for what ?
 this kind of woman can seriously forget it .
 ts sounds more serious about the relationship than her .
 ts deserve a nicer more mature lady .
 but there are plenty of chao sinkies wussies here .
 had that and its over .
 actually got together with the one she hanged out with in that period .
 confirm is dating other guy .
 yes degree mill is same as fake .
 the amount of disgusting misinformation from agency .
 cannot admit wrong or mistake then say black is white
 then study for what ?
 go buy can liao ma
 i just found this thread and quoted it in another edmw thread
 my parcel keep stuck at sorting hub for month then ended up the parcel missing lol
 did a search on ninja van and was surprised to see a 3 .
 9 / 5 rating on google which was decent .
 out of curiosity ,  i dig in deeper to see .
 found that they actually cheated by having phantom accounts to post fake reviews (probably by their own people) .
 for every bad review ,  they will create fake account to bump up the ratings .
 they rather spend money to make cute ninja characters and posting fake reviews rather than fulfilling their delivery on time 
 haiz my logitech order from laz sent by ninja .
 think need to wait one week to come .
 chiu all are considered lucky to have it delivered after a long wait .
 after stucked at processing center for a while ,  mine was cancelled and item returned back to seller with 0 attempt to deliver .
 i face palm and sucked thumb .
 how long was it stuck for ?
 sneaky tactics like a real ninja ,  cos ninja have no honour unlike the samurai
 they too popular oredi .
 end up writing checks their capacity cant cash .
 j&t has been pretty fast for me .
 sometimes support underdog works out better .
 well my aliexpress stuff since 26 april when it left cheena still not receive yet .
 if chiu have a bad experience with ninja van ,  please leave the bad review at the google review .
 they are the biggest parcel hoarder in singapore now .
 they having backlog since april .
 they cannot handle the load yet their management still dont want to limit the number of new parcels coming in .
 their employees sure damn sians and dulan .
 their facebook page stil put 1-3 days delay .
 more like 1-3 weeks delay lor .
 anyway my parcel from qoo10 paid $1 .
 99 qprime shipping ,  delivered today ,  just 1 working day after seller sent out .
 save 49 cents but 10x slower .
 actually it depends on your delivery guy .
 mine is a nice chap ,  never had any problems  .
 both my lazada order oso +1 day even after the app put deliver today by 10pm .
 but singpost damn zhun suddenly .
 i have a good relationship with my guy .
 automatic put in safe space for me .
 no need knock door
 beware of ninja van forcing chiu to sign deliveries that chiu received the package in good order .
 if the package is not in good condition .
 reject it immediately and do not sign anything
 i think it depends on your luck .
 recently i have quite a few deliveries from ninja van ,  j&t ,  they all send sms and whatsapp on the day they will come and all my items were received .
 one local item from singpost delivery failed to show up after 3 weeks ,  now disputing with shopee and seller .
 guys ,  i received sms this morning that my package is out for delivery this morning at 10am .
 i then selected the contactless delivery and at 1pm received a message that the driver nearby .
 got a map to follow oso .
 i see the map the driver keep driving around near my house .
 but until now the package still hasnt delivered .
 anyone experienced this ?
 being following the map for the whole day ,  so disappointing .
 their collection from seller seems to be much faster lately .
 hope my item can come tomorrow or mon .
 experts said public transport no chance to catch .
 these guys are real idiots la .
 not concession card .
 haha none other than oyk .
 will he eat his words now ?
 bus captains mass orgy at the office la .
 it &apos;s bus driver kena not commuters .
 then we have to force oyk and lhl to drive the buses for us .
 oni way u wont catch covid is full lockdown and all dont go out unless buy necessities .
 otherwise go malls ,  take public transport anyhow oso will kena .
 as they said: “ not unexpected “ .
 go back to cb please ,  i want to wfh 
 means they oredi have info ,  just havent disclose .
 the one that give birth to these expert falls under female in gender .
 in before horse back cannon
 i can predict further than that .
 these experts are redundant ,  pay them so much doing the non essential .
 maybe can do a poll .
 to see which one is next
 hoching oso got say mrt v safe cos the ventilation 
 yishun bus interchange damn packed nao
 moi think now take taxi is safest le .
 chiu should get alot business soon
 how come bus drivers tio but bo passengers tio ?
 is it true virus no farecard ?
 lol we called this out damn long ago .
 no one like fishing here ?
 yes confirm is ky .
 someone posted before  
 is she fishing for likes on her jin faps figure .
 mai scare away the fish
 chio bu dont fish ,  they wait to be fished
 i &apos;ll fished her with my hook
 doubt she can tell what kinda lure for what kinda water .
 content creators posing at best .
 jin dua liap sia
 she looks fishy and confirm taste fishy !
 saw sen friend at 6:35 .
 good morning to all !
 no need using fishing rod .
 put nnp into the water even fish will come up suck .
 which one should i eat ?
 why her voice like bigqing .
 her voice sounds sweet
 after all ,  there is no free lunch for this free national vaccination campaign .
 once chiu take the lunch ,  chiu are being experimented with the use of vaccine/s .
 very dangerous to go ,  so many other malls ,  better avoid unless got specific reason .
 his chinese is rubbish max .
 is he even educated sia .
 and he is just like right oso correct ,  left oso right .
 no backbone ,  hope he is not a husband or father
 why need give rebate ?
 crowds will divert to other malls .
 moreover schook holiday .
 shall wait for another case in another mall soon
 now non aircon supermarkets are in fashion .
 hongmao and lucky chains many people .
 very scare to look at them in the eye now
 is the restaurant such a dangerous and dirty place ?
 how come unvax cannot go ah ?
 arbitrary decisions all along
 aircon easier to spread .
 but some restaurants no aircon .
 is foodcourt included ?
 vax wont spread ah ?
 actually it is for the safety of unvax la .
 but the pro vax people twisted the meaning into unvax are infectious ,  burden to society ,  etc .
 unvax are sort of vulnerable if anything their life may be in danger cos no antibodies to counter the virus yet .
 actually it is good oso .
 if all vax people go out dine oso got cluster and cases ,  these people will be fingerpointed .
 the unvax people just need to stay tuned and prepare popcorns la .
 maybe the virus will obey garment instructions not to spread in restaurants .
 obvious discrimination is obvious
 if a cluster pop out at a restaurant ,  most probably it will show as a case number ,  hide their backside .
 not happy chiu go and jab la .
 why so much fuss abt vax unvax
 ya lor ,  got alot of my unvacinnated peers all got 1 common traits .
 single and yolo type .
 think not vaccinated is the hype and always proclaim to the world they will never take vaccine .
 yeah usually selfish bo chup  attitude but yet now when the measures are selfish and bochup towards them instead they cannot take it    .
 chiu reap what chiu sow
 how are food courts in malls gonna enforce it ?
 pap is incompetent and flip flop their decisions
 oredi explained ,  hawkers are open air  .
 go read up the news lah
 is unvax are dirty .
 they don’t want unvax dirty f&b establishment
 go and farking get vaxxed ,  whats so hard
 mo 24/7 stay at home ,   vac or no vac oso no difference .
 same logic as covid is immune in public buses and mrt trains .
 i saw some shops selling used half gold 16013 at 8k plus .
 4-5 years ago i oni got it at 3 .
 why jump so high now ?
 or shop bluff chewren one ?
 go buy tag heuer la much cheaper
 tag heuer really is useless brand .
 gold price increased alot from 4-5 years ago
 so rolex really is a valuable investment ?
 for those who have rolex ,  should hold on to it ya ?
 the watch chio can oredi lah
 top up a bit to buy iwc watch .
 the real gold is not alot .
 really ordinary looking watch that not even worth that money .
 lol u must be the type that likes to wear things that scream $$$$
 now $18k cos discontinued .
 not have money can buy oso .
 bro very satki atas siol .
 why never take photo and gpgt here ?
 i gpgt almost everyday leh .
 anyway the roi is shat la 5 years oni $5-7k .
 u better off go casino
 isnt it much better than putting it inside bank ?
 20k for 2-3 year in bank probably oni give u $20-30 more of interest .
 likely the children want to quickly sell after the uncle no longer around ?
 lao uncle watch .
 not all rolex model appreciate la is just lucky this model got discontinued  .
 so if u asking is buying rolex a good investment ,  might be no .
 selling might be problematic too
 not all shop will offer u good price .
 most will low ball u .
 losing their virgin more earlier than expected
 it will eventually become a “weekly sweep”  
 who to pay for the tests kits
 test kits provider jin huat
 mr ccs secondary school leh ?
  some waitiing for your gahment to approve sinovac …hello ?
 i don’t even dare to poke my nose ,  chiu think kid dare meh ?
 and what happen to school is the safest place ?
 chiu think give three test kit parents will automatic test their kids meh ?
 still do what sohai check
 just do hbl la  .
 thos parents oso sibei  .
 like to get their kids out to school and risking it  just cos they cant concentrate at home with kids .
 what the fark .
 so easily distracted meh .
 chiu are adults for fark sake
 even for those who self test  ,  it may still be false negative if not done correctly .
 why their problem become our problem ?
 those pri school students one week have to poke nose thrice .
 one time sweep > monthly > weekly > daily
 future test kit who buy ?
 taxpayers money ,  so go one round we still are the ones paying for it .
 possibly will end up weekly ,  then if got case ,  will be daily for two weeks .
 from their pattern can guess .
 finally a useful minister who is taking concrete actions !
 might be biowarfare .
 sorry i forgot to flush toilet
 eunos oso got but now no more ,  i thought is my toilet lol
 my side the whatapp group now all kpkb liao
 ok own up which bbfa lao dua sai again ?
 my side oso got a funny smell .
 very strong sai bi ,  must be the collective laosai of all edmw bbfa
 yeah today’s announcement cause all bbfa to chuak sai
 tampines just now oso got strange sai smell .
 death omen for d cuntry maybe
 not the first time liao .
 i thought was related to the market at my block below .
 synthetic sai first time hear
 ya ,  east side had earlier on .
 thought which sewerage pipe burst lol
 sorry just ate mcspciy 
 wtf ,  my wife oso smelt just now !
 past few days oso can smell ,  but it comes and goes .
 booked marked  ,  will bump 20th dec .
 best way is to do nothing  ,  confirm plus chop .
 but if really must do something  ,  go eat nice nice food without her  ,  no need to pay for her =)
 gotta move on ,  usually its hard la cos human all crave companionship ,  worse still if shes like a few points above u ,  cos u will feel like cant find another one as chio or can click as good .
 but everything is temporary ,  its oni your turn & u will just meet another one in the future ,  most likely she will come contact u in the future ,  but u shouldnt invest nothing more than just to piak and dump .
 maybe she considering opening up her legs for some other guy she feels sexually attracted to .
 while chiu busy sitting on chair emoing thinking about it ,  she busy on her knees eyes closed blowing him off enjoying
 first thing u notice when u meet her after 2 weeks .
 confirm dai chop guarantee .
 new necklace from the new guy .
 ( confirm tiffany and co ) .
 her face turn white and pale when chiu at her .
 when u are talking to her face to face ,  that new guy will be whatsapp her asking her how etc .
 u got harm her anot etc bull .
 proven and verfied .
 trust the uncles and bros here .
 haha if end then i doubt i will get into another relationship le .
 she is my first and oni gf ,  previously oredi accepted i will be single forever but just cos she is really really damn super special thus i chased her to be gf .
 i will just go back enjoy my single life as i have done for so long .
 ts ,  chiu oso give yourself a bteak .
 go and try a new hobby ,  make new friends .
 i know it hurts and will be emotionally challenging/painful .
 when things doesnt work out u can be sure she will run to chiu .
 its at this moment u ignore n continue walking away
 haha ok ,  whatever happens will be ,  i can accept it .
 attached or single not u should always enjoy life ,  new hobbies making new connections .
 i think alot of the sad unable to move on mindset arises from thinking its gone ,  instead of being glad remembering that this r/s happened and the good memories .
 accept it and who knows chiu will meet another special one that clicks with u
 sory to hear that ts .
 situation is dire .
 think on the brighter side ,  after that 2 weeks will be new year .
 new year new chiu new mentality new life new gf .
 take this period to oso look back on yourself ,  reflect and cleanse yourself mentally and ready for new relationship .
 dump her before she dumps you
 oh relak  ,  she oni come over my place and stay with me 2 weeks  .
 after we had enough sex then she back to u
 can find new one liao 
 but korean drama cool off 3 years still happy ending    .
 jerrold shu shu thanks for your advice  ,  moi learn something from chiu today  .
 every real man will/have gone through this path .
 no matter what happens ,  remember that the pain is oni temporary and chiu will emerge a wiser and stronger man .
 please update us after 2 weeks
 she going to try out with new guy .
 if the new guy is siao lang .
 she will run back to u .
 chiu no longer her cruise .
 chiu is just an rescue boat
 usally break is to find new dick to piak
 that guy videoing up close
 where is the fight ?
 are they ahtiong bu ?
 please jail them all 
 this kind of standard .
 i thought at least have .
 gina carano vs ronda rousey kind of standard la !
 i doubt police would press charge to women fighting .
 dont look like tiong lei
 looks like pinoy maids
 looks like philipino
 look more like pinoy/indonesian
 fight over bangalah ?
 sibei ugly leh .
 why referee not wearing back  ?
 no buttie wan to merry them both ?
 women fight always pull hair .
 actually one way to stop worrying about yourself is to be more concerned for others .
 not just for girls but anyone and everyone .
 it &apos;s got nothing to do with kindness but more about the ability to visualise what others might be thinking and doing .
 i believe its a useful skill everywhere .
 might be called empathy .
 u never know their down side .
 oni see their positive side .
 being single still the best .
 freedom and money with u  .
 my friends mentioned that a key trait of me is my ability to empathise with others .
 however ,  i often let my own insecurities get the better of me .
 i am always constantly questioning am i good enough ?
 good and bad is different for everyone .
 what my parents think is good is ridiculous to me .
 how people judge u is based on their needs .
 for example a beggar is the best judge for generosity haha .
 dont worry about the local gal part ,  since similar to chiu ,  i prefer foreign girls alot more .
 so will not take it into offence ,  cos i empathise with chiu lolol .
 the gals i know ,  atb even in my current uni ,  they are usually hovering around 2nd girl beauty ,  maybe slightly better .
 this is overseas uni ,  where their family quite well-off to send them abroad to study .
 the one i am in contact with for a long time ,  is probably slimmer version of 2nd girl ,  but one big difference ,  is atb dress up alot more than singapore gals .
 might look prettier ,  but that oso means chiu gotta dress up more lol .
 since chiu want to aim 3rd/4th gal ,  got to improve and work on yourself ,  there &apos;s no other shortcut .
 my penpal ,  another atb was girl 3 face shape ,  but better visuals than 4th gal .
 that one not easy to find .
 her visuals are probably good enough to go on dating show ,  i can pm chiu if chiu want to ssrr lol .
 these girls usually very rare and few .
 yeah can make friends in school ,  hopefully it goes well .
 i met some nice girls there ,  but didnt get an opportunity to translate it into relationship .
 atb might be hard to chase ,  typically expect guys to buy house on their own ,  earn more than them .
 now ,  higher cost of living ,  their standards higher than in the past .
 this video is good start
 women are despicable bishes
 i personally dated and piak amdl in london .
 yes pump full tank song ,  but they all golddiggers and money face .
 costs about $10k a month .
 feeling jaded and resentful .
 no wonder some yankee people shooting spree .
 i share the same sentiments .
 u got aunt dino who likes your post sia !
 this is good advice .
 before long u will have girls flocking for u .
 theres reasons why some girls even the guy married attached they still want his diks .
 its the ezact reason
 7:21 being angmo jin good ,  girls can accommodate cos of cultural difference and  dating habits 
 hello bro ,  if udm can pm me to ssrr ?
 yes i heard the same from my cheena friends .
 they mentioned that cheena girls typically have higher standards nowadays but “foreigners” (westerners but including engrish educated overseas chinese such as singaporeans) do still have a sizeable advantage over their locals ,  especially if one show to be able to integrate well into their culture or shows a distinct interest in their way of life .
 don’t know how true is this… .
 in general my cheena friends oso mentioned that they are more “visual people” ,  in a sense that one can be a bit cmi in the looks/body department but must show to be able to dress well .
 thou that’s what i can gather till date :/ ,  maybe bro/sis here can add on .
 23yo is still a baby .
 but if at this age still haven dated before means what ?
 means something is very wrong with chiu oredi .
 most likely girls see chiu all run like hell .
 this is the oni explanation .
 either chiu slim down ,  mod yourself or upgrade to make lots of money (in which looks wont matter as chiu can literally buy gf/wife) ,  chiu will have to consider paying here a visit: .
 thank chiu sir…you speak the truth .
 chinese girls generally have better street smart skills ,  actually most countries even malaysians have better street smart skills .
 cooking ,  resourcefulness and oso dressing sense ,  which i see alot of sinkies lacking behind compared to them .
 the advantage probably depends oso your career potential and how much money chiu have .
 the chinese dating show i watched ,  dating involves alot of gift-giving ,  acts of service (cooking/buying a meal for them/driving them around) ,  words of affirmation (appreciation note) .
 this is besides the usual chatting and trying to gel with the girl .
 one of the guys i know ,  he doesnt drive but he makes it up with being a good cook since he lived abroad before .
 if neither good at cooking nor driving ,  i dont think anyone was like this in that show .
 probably more pragmatic ,  presentability matters alot more .
 have to dress up ,  go exercise ,  work out .
 it definitely helps .
 oso not cheap entering the dating scene ,  considering the gift giving + the clothes chiu have to buy on taobao .
 they do alot to woo someone .
 the amount of supplication just to woo a lady is ridiculous .
 many guys here continue to have the same silly ideas .
 which is why even a tiny amount of game will take chiu a very very long way in singapore .
 will probably take chiu an even longer way in cheena .
 i &apos;ve used this word 3 times now by the way .
 it &apos;s a concept .
 chiu figure it out ,  dating goes on easy mode .
 thats all i &apos;ll say .
 oni think about the good side of rs never think about the bad side
 pal ,  chiu are oni 23 .
 what’s the concept ?
 just ordered something again and find out is under ninja van again guess my order will be slow liao gg .
 why so many companies start using ninja van ?
 j&t one day in warehouse next day delivered for me very fast .
 ordered from lazada  .
 ninjavan sent me a text to say delivering ,  waited whole day  .
 went out for run at 5pm ,  came back at 7pm and the package was outside the door haha .
 i opted for contactless delivery but still wondering how the deliveryman came up cos my condo lift need to buzz people up to the floor
 everything got good got bad .
 just relak it will come .
 so far i never get any missing packages .
 i think my item coming today .
 got their message .
 fingers crossed lol .
 seems like they are back to the usual speed recently .
 omg zalora now deliver slow cos it uses ninja van gg liao from normal 2 day delivery going to take one week liao  .
 must  call the shop what delivery they use before order nowadays .
 my items delivered .
 this round quite fast .
 4 june ordered .
 ninja surprisingly on the ball recently .
 they picked up from merchant yesterday and delivered today .
 honestly hope it stays this way .
 anyone know how long once is processing at ninja facility ?
 it says up to 3 working days but i hope to receive tomorrow
 isit processing at facility yesterday then today deliver ?
 my ninjavan delivery was quite on the ball leh .
 item delivered in good condition ,  in 2 working days 
 ninja van is the worst performer during my recent purchases .
 they will pick up from the seller next day after order is ready for collection .
 store item in their hub for a few days ,  my experience up to 6 days then handover to deliveryman to attempt deliver  .
 i find qxpress fast ,  jt&t not bad too .
 seems like shopee local seller like to use ninja van
 package oredi at my house downstairs thought the guy will come up even though it says  &apos;more than 20 stops away &apos; since he is oredi downstairs .
 but that fella u-turn when he at my void deck then now he is 5km away oredi .
 shopee malaysian seller more likely to use ninjavan .
 no wonder the other day i saw the ninja delivery guy didnt wear ninja uniform .
 maybe employed those jobless .
 sent from my armpit hardwarezone forums app
 my parcel was sent to the wrong floor last time .
 since then dont really trust ninja van service .
 experts full of nonsense
 next time go interchange must tap tracetogether first
 their experts is the ahbeng selling handphone or the ahseng selling durians ?
 well the experts didnt come to edmw i guess
 the word  &apos;expert &apos; has been abused multiple times since covid .
 knn these arseholes again talking like captain obvious .
 why didnt they  predict it when we open up ?
 30 july then delay leepork 8 cases …… .
 knn moi maths question to mtf: how many are there altogether ?
 this sexpert leong again  .
 edmw got more experts
 haahaahaha zun bohh bro ?
 chiu nair see cabbies dont wear mask proper insai empty cabs huanz ?
 sexpert said bird talk .
 who doesn know most of the cases are fully vaxxxx .
 did someone say vaxxx liao is just a common flu .
 why worry when the nation is vaxxx rate is so high and it is endemic leh ?
 1) the reason singapore didnt have high deaths like angmo countries is not due to our policies but rather luck ,  maybe our bodies are different .
 2) if we dont do anything then the virus just slowly slowly become more potent lor until eventually something actually happens and we need to do something .
 and no vaccine isnt one of those things as evidence has shown .
 a job which not many sink would do .
 their schedule is tight and have to depend on road traffic .
 nlw with so many on qo how the interchange would operate ?
 are ministers on standby mode ?
 bus no safe ,  taxi no safe .
 mrt safest but mrt not every where have de .
 so walking to mrt or ride bicycle to every where ?
 vaxx liao no need to do regular covid test for essential works .
 why gahment is giving out n95 mask and test kits  ?
  endemic means like flu .
 or they could predict the future  ?
 most local infected cases are fully vxxxx .
 just that unvaxxxx  ,  it is more deadly .
  but infected case not as much as fully vaxxx
 how can virus oni took public transportation now after coming 2 years .
 suddenly infection numbers reported .
 is this a joke ?
 they start to buy ezlink card ?
 is it ez card on big sales discounts now ?
 llst lohh bohh how oso  .
 endemic endemic endemic
 after 18 months since start of covid ,  now then acknowledge that there is a possible widespread transmission through public transport system .
 our powerful  bus and train air circulation scrubbing system not as good as they have always claimed ?
 the selling price are all bullshhiiit la .
 when u say u wann sell them 20% cheaper .
 they tell u dont have this price la .
 really chop carrot one
 i asked one shop .
 straight away discount like 1k plus off the retail price .
 is like pinnacle some can selling 1m but when some try kena low ball  .
 rollie selling like ap price now .
 ap selling like pp price now
 whr is good to hoot tag ?
 so far my ad 20% off oni by cash
 so much cloth how to steam ?
 nobody likes ferlyn ?
 i want to wash her armpit for her
 a man of culture
 hmm is not selfie right
 jin cute zeh zeh
 if she had bigger boobs i would .
 who wear jeans in the tub ?
 at least show panties mah
 she looks damn ky
 confirm she not slug cos she never bath naked
 dunno ferlyn is who
 actress ,  ex kpop star
 siao lang wear clothes in bathtub for what
 as usual ,  their measures have zero logic at all
 chiur body ,  chiur choice .
 dont get swayed by other people 
 cos covid virus high ses oni go restoran ,  just as they go casino ,  malls ,  take plane .
 mtf really is protect unvaccinated by limiting them to hawker and coffeeshop knowing covid dont go there ,  thank chiu corridor ong and friends
 vax or no vax ,  covid wont spread in bus or mrt no fear .
 different price point lar
 dogs are oso not allowed in restaurant .
 another gahment initiative attempt to get the non vax to go jab ,  else chiu cannot join your frens or colleagues to go jiak restaurant food .
 see la they are literally squeezing the non vax to the corner liao
 im oredi fully vax with moderna hor ,  not simi lanjiao sinovac .
 im not happy that unvax can eat hawker .
 they are not clean and should oni be allowed to cook at their own homes .
 dining-in is a high risk activity - no mask ,  diners talk to one another .
 im sure the gahment would prefer to open up dining *only* to the vaccinated ,  monitor the situation and open up to the unvaccinated much later on .
 however ,  knowing that hawker centres and coffeeshops are important to many sinkies including the unvaccinated ,  they are giving a *concession* to the unvaccinated; give the unvaccinated some chance to dine out to preserve their sanity .
 although it is true that hawker centres and coffeeshops are open air ,  i feel that is not the main reason for the differentiation .
 like my wife ,  stopped after first bnt where she got allergy effect .
  advise to get non mrna vaccine ,  but none is under gahment list yet ,  what to do  ?
 dining with ceca is ok
 u should understand y restaurant can have 5 people but kopitiam or hawker just 2 .
 kopitian and hawker are normal people .
 rich people open restaurants .
 if chiu vax then can get the numbers and % up then can reopen sooner .
 it’s not always about chiu  .
 do your civic duty and get vax now
 if dont allow unvax to eat out at all .
 i think we can agree with the narrative is to reduce the risk of spreading .
 if sideline unvaxx to the lowest ses makan place .
 i think is just bullying .
 didnt the gahment just announce that they will extend the same dining flexibilities to those vaccinated with any vaccine approved by who ,  including non mrna ones like sinovac ,  sinopharm etc ?
 chiu think too much and give too much credit to the governmenr .
 the simple reason is that it is not practical to assign people to check everyone &apos;s vaccination in a hawker centre .
 eh sinovac oredi accepted if your wife cant take 2nd dose due to allergy .
 for someone who is unvaccinated ,  isnt it better to be allowed to dine in at hawker centres and coffeeshops ,   than be barred from dining-in at *all* eateries ?
 not happy go vote lim tean in as chancellor la !
 he got up close video recording 
 seen alot of people previously not interested in finance all of a sudden getting into stocks and alot of people at my workplace discuss openly .
 one new intern who is barely 22 a female undergrad even talk about shares during breaktime and ask if i invest as well ,  i dont like talking about personal things at work so i said no then she started explaining to me .
 her understanding was hit and miss .
 really seems scary like extreme exuberance and everyday normies getting involved .
 anyone here have the same feeling ?
 im not saying that we should panic sell everything .
 but i am thinking about buying short term protection in terms of a 3-6 month put for my portfolio .
 what chiu guys think ?
 do chiu think there exist irrational exuberance and are we near the top ?

 it will become a **** hole when school open .
 primary school kid pee kang virginity gib covid tests liao !
 is this where we &apos;ve come to as a society ?
 getting primary school kids to stick their noses with swabs ?
 when many dont even like cotton bud sticks sticking in their ears to clean them out ?
 for an art test thats known to be inaccurate ?
 clown world we live in .
 one time testing does not mean all time cleared from covid .
 they can still can in contact with covid postive people and get infected .
 dont see the assurance guaranteed
 there are students with special needs in mainstream schools .
 i am sure the experience will be a horrible experience for them .
 endemic test what test !
 really got the low ses face 
 test the kids how to use the test kits .
 so they know no need to poke backsides .
 $ really more impt .
 test kit manufacturer huat .

 the fact they willing to sacrifice sinkie for global agenda is very concerning .
 it means noone fit for pm anymore
 working parents given 8 free kits for weekly test .
 children given 3 free kits at school .
 household given 6 free kits .
 not cheap thing to buy test kits for the whole family after free kits used up .
 it &apos;s extra weekly expenses .
 they should do the swab in school though ,  under supervision .
 bring home most parents wouldn’t swab their kids… .
 should conduct in school and positive send for hq .
 if at home ,  will parents lie/cheat (assume kids is well but positive) so that he/she can take exams (esp .
 psle ,  o level) ?
 knowing how kiasu parents in singapore are  .
 why does singapore still use nose poke art when there are saliva art kits being used elsewhere ?
 means so many primary school students kena covid until have to do this ?
 endemic liao so why test .

 satki glass hearts .
 boycott the anime ?
 lol i thought they been pirating it all these while
 mouth say buyao buyao .
 but will still pirate the anime and hear her anyway .
 if no happy ,  dont watch animes .
 this one very sensitive subject .
 is equal to denying that your ahgong was machine gunned in changi by jap soldier .
 it &apos;s basically what mly ,  i and maybe a couple others are sharing here .
 but we &apos;re barely scratching the surface .
 dude ,  finding love is one thing .
 being able to love the same person for life is another .
 i can guarantee there will be times chiu will want to tear your hair out when chiu marry someone of the opposite gender .
 so dont be in a hurry to settle down .
 take your time to improve yourself so the right girl can come into your life .
 every guy has a women that love them the most ,  and thats their mother .
 love is unconditional .
 any relationship that chiu build a with a women that requires chiu to have a career ,  car ,  job etc are conditional .
 these arent love ,  just transactions .
 dont be deluded .
 human relationships are full of problems cos we bring our own ego ,  emotions ,  feelings ,  wounds ,  projections with us .
 not just with opp sex but with family ,  friends ,  colleagues etc as well .
 not all parents love unconditionally ,  maybe yours did but many people &apos;s parents sure didnt .
 but what i learned is that ,  chiu can give yourself unconditional love by fully accepting yourself for who chiu are ,  flaws ,  weaknesses ,  quirks and all ,  and have compassion for yourself when chiu make mistakes .
 sometimes we &apos;re our own harshest critic .
 well ,  definitely there are women that abandon their children at orphanage or left with their relatives .
 there are even incident of kid starving to death cos their mother left them alone to go have a staycation with her boyfriend .
 men should learn to avoid women like these .
 reminder ,  i am still a bbfa .
 i dont mean abandon .
 for eg if a mother constantly invalidates her kid ,  use threats or say things like  &apos;if chiu dont behave or get 90 marks for your next test i &apos;ll teach chiu a lesson &apos; .
 and the lesson can be silent treatment ,  withholding love & affection or favoritism .
 this is called conditional love & its common .
 doesnt need to be outright abuse or abandonment .
 that is true ,  i think the biggest thing is self-awareness and self-care .
 i am learning alot of stuff from korean reality shows (not drama) ,  it documents lives of singles who bought their own house/car ,  have busy schedules (work/career) ,  have a pet (a lot of them have) ,  hang out with friends and pursue hobbies outside of work with friends or solo .
 for myself ,  i see twenties ,  chiong career .
 learn how to make money .
 socialise with friends and pursue hobbies outside of work/career .
 enjoy good food + travel (the latter if covid is gone) .
 thirties can be split into two groups ,  early 30s and late 30s .
 early 30s ,  can use it to build career and decide what kind of accommodation chiu want to get .
 socialise with more people and hang out as friends .
 if stable enough ,  can go dating .
 late 30s ,  buy a place/car ,  go dating .
 by this age range ,  i think it &apos;s alright to go into the game .
 speaking of transactional love ,  it &apos;s going to be far ,  far easier to find someone from a developing country that is not well-off as singapore or lower ses .
 thats pretty much confirmed ,  i have been testing out foreign dating sites and apps ,  and my performance is way better than in singapore ,  measuring based on the likes i get .
 i dont bother to respond since it &apos;s just a social experiment .
 chiu do whatever chiu think is right for chiu and thats the most impt thing ,  no need to fit into whatever timeline the society has imposed on us .
 looks like chiu have clear goals so thats really good leh !
 people from developing countries def will die to come here .
 if they can use chiu as a bridge to cross from their own country to singapore then to them its considered successful oredi .
 but from what i see ,  fts are pretty opportunistic so they may see chiu as a savior but not for long .
 my vietbu neighbor constantly shouts at her kids and quarrels with her local husband over trivial things and they obviously have no respect for each other .
 timeline helps to serve as a guide ,  but to be frank as long as improvement is consistent ,  then that should be good .
 along the way ,  people are going to give up and if chiu just keep fighting ,  chiu will get better over time .
 yeah definitely ,  but i believe it boils down to individual discernment .
 for instance ,  i have a friend who married a vietbu ,  but the vietbu is not the typical village girl or reliant on hubby type .
 she was born in vietnam ,  came to singapore ,  met my friend there and was studying in the states .
 she graduated from the states and subsequently got a job there .
 my friend later went to the states so they were re-united .
 when chiu are capable/competent ,  chiu have alot more choice to decide the kind of gal that chiu will end up with .
 and the goal is to find someone that mirrors this ideal traits that chiu look out for .
 of course ,  people change over time and might become a different person during marriage .
 main thing is dont settle for the sake of settling and if cant find that ,  back to single mode .
 not an issue actually .
 this is cos it &apos;s easier to have high expectations for their kids than having high expectations for themselves .
 yes this ,  its all about projections .
 no true love nvm .
 u can has cheeseburger instead 
 no need be a try hard one la .
 do own thing no regrets one .
 do everything for somebody else ,  no reciprocate chu oso suck thumb .
 be the better man ,  do things for churself no need people to acknowledge .
 people wan see no see not chur business .
 chu mind churself good enough liao .
 hello friends ,  back in this thread after seeing the third girl have a new boyfriend on her instagram .
 feeling sick and depressed af 
 hello friends ,  hope everyone is having a good friday night… .
 what third girl ?
 word of advice i always tell myself ,   .
 i can live without a girl but i cannot live without my laobu  .
 moi make sure any girl who gonna affect moi emotion  ,  moi will not pass the same exact emotion to moi parents seeing their child suffering cos of one chao cheesepie .
 don’t let your problem become your parents problem .
 so chiu gonna handle it  .
 i mean she doesn’t consider chiu then why chiu so sad ?
 not like chiu sad liao she will come to chiu .
 @eternal-fire  ,  any advice for ts ?
 what third girl ,  chiu know her personally ?
 fast forward 2 months now ,  have chiu found someone oredi ?
 my ninja delivery quite smooth .
 not much of an issue .
 just got my vacuum cleaner delivered by ninja van ,  sat on their warehouse for three days~ 
 been waiting 4 hours yet the same driver is driving round and round in buangkok for the past 4 hours .
 i never had problem with ninja van .
 people who usually complain either are impatient or cocked up something at their own end .
 yup i am sure ninja van is so totally flawless ,  100% perfect problem free delivery rate and 5/5 star reviews right from day 1 of their operations .
 the vast majority of us here complaining about them must just be imaging things .
 any idiot can make stupid sweeping statements .
 if chiu scroll up chiu can see the complainers of ninja van are those who dont understand courier logistics de .
 the complaints are the same .
 all kpkb their package in the warehouse for a few days .
 if the seller give chiu 3 day delivery .
 day 0 is pick up and processed in the facility .
 day 1-2 collect dust .
 day 3 out for delivery .
 some buyers really expect the sky lol
 chiu just started with online shopping ?
 so far so good for me .
 had one package delivered before lunch today .
 got telegram message last night notifying me package collected from seller .
 this morning text me will deliver today .
 before lunch received .
 my 2 most recent shopee purchases .
 singpost to mailbox .
 j&t express to door .
 both took less than 24 hours between checking into sorting hub -> delivered .
 if even the notorious stinkpost can be that efficient during this period ,  then i dunno how ninja van can justify having their packages sit at their sorting hub for 2-3 days minimum .
 and that is aside from other myraid of problems they have like lost parcels and missed/rescheduled deliveries .
 but hey ,  shills and apologists please continue coming up with excuses and enjoy having picnic at your perceived moral high ground .
 my deliveries are all on the ball recently .
 all next day after collection from merchant .
 but some of the couriers simply leave the item outside my gate and leave ,  no attempt to knock .
 best not to order perishables if courier is ninja .
 suck to the core ,  ccb ninja turtle .
 will avoid merchant who took this lanjiao delivery service .
 premium bandai recently switch from yamato to ninjavan .
 box come one corner kena a bit .
 luckily is packing box ,  inside product still pristine .
 anyone noticed ninjavan changed their delivery service ?
 about last month once your item in the van chiu will get telegram/sms message saying parcel on the way and chiu can track live the person .
 when that function still exist ,  i saw the person about 500m away from me doing deliveries and i thought he will come in an hour or so .
 he oni came 6 hours later .
 now ninjavan just send chiu sms saying that your shipment will come in 3 days between 0900 to 2200 hrs .
 then oni actual day they will send chiu a telegram message saying  &apos;on the way &apos; but never give exact time and no tracking .
 all along they will sms chiu in the morning and inform to expect a delivery .
 the so called  &apos;live tracking &apos; was oni introduced 1-2 months ago probably on a trial basis .
 my guess maybe they kena alot of feedback or complaints from recipients about why tracking shows the delivery guy is at the block but delivery oni made xxx hours later .
 ultimately no point having so called  &apos;live tracking &apos; if its inaccurate and give recipients a false sense to expect imminent delivery .
 ninja van is like ninja .
 will just leave the package outside silently and disappear .
 got once delivered at 2pm ,  oni discovered at 10pm , luckily nobody take .
 j&t oso like ninja now .
 but i think it really depends on the person in charge of your area .
 i see ,  didnt really use ninjavan much before cb .
 even if i did ,  never used to work together with parcelsanta so i dont really need to worry .
 oso ,  i usually ask them to send to the watson &apos;s near my place for collection ,  better for me .
 now with cb/sd measures ,  i must be home to receive things ,  and there is no real alternatives or way to inform never to deliver to their collect boxes in malls .
 i think there is few types of ninjas .
 1) private contractor on ninja platform doing delivery for private/home based or small businesses .
 so it is similar to grabsend .
 goods will never be at ninja warehouse .
 2) ninja employee working for ninja who partners with established retailers who will either stock or collect goods from seller to deliver .
 goods are normally consolidated at ninja warehouse .
 3) third party contractors who will pick up from ninja partners to deliver the goods without the goods ever touching ninja warehouse .
 i believe when ninja used to partner with parcelsanta ,  number 1 have no access to parcelsanta ,  oni 2 and 3 have .
 i buy thing from lazada and put self collect at collection point .
 somehow they tag it to delivery to my address .
 i didnt update my address after i move but it doesnt matter cause i put as self collect and not to my address .
 so they deliver to old address .
 i tell them to redirect liao  when i know about it then the next day they still send another item to the old address .
 people in this thread think courier service oni service them
 my biggest complain about ninjavan is the package almost always comes banged up .
 take extra care of people &apos;s parcels if chiu care about your customers .
 will wong and his friends still use the same excuses ?
 nothing wrong with their policies to allow 5 to dine in .
 risks outweigh benefits .
 kpi is 100% vax so its sgeans fault cos they are not cooperative .
 cos schooling didnt get gold .
 suddenly experts enlightened .
 where commoners told the experts like one year ago .
 stand up for cecapore
 next will be mrt stations .
 chiu have potential be experts too  .
 virus upgraded upskills too .
 liddat how moi commute to werk ?
 diam la experts .
 horse back cannon
 thanks experts ,  for the advance warning !
 bus drivers intermingle
 why they die die dont want to close these interchange ?
 then everyone work from home ?
 back to phase 1 ?
 then oni can watch it burn !
 so many unlink cases ,  sure got cases due to bus capt and interchange
 i say many times back in may and jun and even july .
 p2ha is half-hearted (simi can open business la ,  can commute la ,  cannot dine in then can dine in two then can dine in 5 (with all the complicated rules for vaxxed vs unvaxxed) .
 this is the reason why there is still a baseline spread of infections that never seem to die .
 and given enough activity (like after 19 aug) ,  there will be a resurgence of delta (cause we neber get rid of the baseline spread in the first place cause we didn’t have full lockdown .
 when i said this ,  i kena criticised for wanting to kill economy la ,  wanting to kill employees la ,  etc .
 now with the benefit of hindsight ,  can all these folks who criticise me say i was wrong ?
 why is it so impossible back in may to lock down gao gao for 1 month ,  even 1 .
 5 months to reduce covid back down to zero before reopening again ?
 if chiu compare having a gao gao lock down in may vs .
 the situation we are in now with rolling surges ,  maybe endemic gostan again ,  which is worse ?
 the companies out there ,  do they suffer more now with this model we are in ?
 the companies that people say they are worried about when they say they dont like lockdown in may ,  these are tourism and travel related (ahem sq) .
  are these companies better off today now that we are at the precipice of another surge ?
 this christmas is not with chiu .
 ts hurry go find a better lady .
 got money dont worry chiu got no wood to burn .
 order kfc to destress .
 how did chiu meet her ?
 how long are both of chiu together ?
 is she the career minded type ?
 means she wants cool down period .
 ts hongz ganz liao .
 if ts dontch faster find out huat &apos;s the root of the problem ,  after the cool down period means gg liao .
 u say this now .
 few months/years down the road ,  when u meet a new girl .
 kukujiao start to think again .
 no matter what ,  all the best to your future .
 hope u can find one who shares the same chemistry as u .
 moi gotch a fwen who said that before too .
 huat super special .
 never get into another r/s those kind of bs .
 found another gf .
 then changed another gf .
 then changed until dunno which gf liao .
 couple where got such thing as 2 week break one .
 either she &apos;s trying out another guy for that 2 weeks and make her choice secretly .
 or she has an abortion appointment and needs 2 weeks to recover .
 want means steady together .
 dont want means f off .
 simi timeout simi break  .
 bout one and half year .
 nope ,  not career minded ,  can live a very simple life and really wife material
 i &apos;d make the break permanent .
 moi ex say to remain friends so i didnt contact her ended up she said i wanted the break up .
 some women very good at twisting words .
 dont like the feeling of being sh !
 usually girl want face mah ,  can tell their friends is the guy want breakup ,  bad guy etc
 year end coming take 2 weeks break she want to enjoy festive celebration with new guy and if it doesnt work out ,  get back together with chiu to celebrate countdown ?
 even if there &apos;s no third party ,  i think she place herself higher than chiu and the rs .
 find someone who loves chiu more better .
 anyone can help feed ts red pill ?
 means chiu cant give her happiness and need to consider chiu .
 means she’s sugging another dick .
 hope chiu never kiss  her recently .
 my ex gf was seeing another guy and started all the take a break and disappearing nonsense .
 best of all when i asked for break up she told whole world i cheated on her with her bestie .
 she want to spend christmas celebrations with someone else .
 more exciting things for her ahead .
 property agents really all are scum

 low ses crime ,  stupid .
 now mask so cheap .
 1 box less than $5 oso have .
 david chin sing chuin ,  59 ,  who was previously a property agent with propnex ,  was sentenced to one week &apos;s jail .
 he pleaded guilty to two cheating charges .
 between march 1 and 14 ,  he used ic numbers belonging to 11 of his clients to illegally redeem masks .
 one of his clients made a complaint to propnex on march 22 .
 when confronted ,  chin told his then employer that he had used his clients &apos; ic numbers to redeem mask packs on oni one occasion .
 propnex terminated chin and said they do not tolerate such behaviour .
 a total of 10 masks were recovered from chin .
 one of the clients had asked for his mask to be returned and chin later mailed it to him .
 ang and chin are both out on bail and are expected to surrender themselves on tuesday and thursday respectively to begin serving their sentences .
 the police previously said they will spare no effort in apprehending those who cheat to redeem masks .
 those convicted of cheating may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined .
 9 weeks jail for stealing mask .

 cannot go restaurant but can cluster fark in mrt n buses .
 wu ji implement unvaxxed cannot take public transport .
 yeah i know ,  covid no ezlink .
 cos hitler hates .
 what is the real objective here ?
 when they open and cluster starts forming at restaurant ,  i will laugh die first before covid hits me .
 they think i &apos;ll keep us  &apos;safe &apos;
 i got a large popcorn can share with chiu .
 see hw they blame the next cluster .
 cos this covid is nt getting better .
 100% sure got new clusters coming .
 as i understand ,  sinovac has submitted their report last week and hsa will take 6 to 8 weeks to see whether it will be put under the national programme .
 just follow their instructions .
 country looks calm on the surface but below oredi very chaotic oredi .
 yes ,  they will extend the same dining flexibilities to those vaccinated with any vaccine approved by who  but no ,  as sinovac is still not under the national programme  !
 it has oredi been announced and confirmed .
 nothing to do with national programme .
 this is oni if chiu were given the green light to go for sinovac at a public hospital .
 if your wife was deemed to be allergic ,  she should have oredi been referred to take sinovac instead which will then allow her to dine out .
 lucky i at home 24/7 .
 please get yourself vaccinated !
 so that we dont risk overloading the medical system should chiu get infected when the economy opens up .
 if the concern is that chiu and your wife cannot dine out ,  get your wife to go for a sinovac shot now .
 it &apos;s irrelevant whether sinovac is under the national vaccination programme when it comes to dining out .
 those unvaccinated have many restrictions that prevent them from mingling with others    
 chiu will get him into more trouble than the vaccine .
 the wife will blame for him for risking her life with the vaccine while he did not take .
 this is a terrible advice from a single to a married man .
 covid too poor to visit restaurants .
 just now news said for foodcourt have to show your vaccination status .
 if unvax can oni dabao ,  but then is the ambassador going to follow those unvax ensure them rly dabao and exit ?
 if a person bo chup ,  mouth say dabao but go buy and find a seat how ?
 or the stall staff ,  will ask a second time for proof of vax ?
 who made the rules ?
 chiu think these people eat at restaurants or hawkers ?
 i have bookmarked it .
  the part 3 version but every time i click on the link it wouldnt work and it is always a blank page .
 does that thread still exist  ?
 i did a forum search of the thread title and nothing shows up .
 darkness must be feeling jin high from all the hate and condemnation directed at her now .
 for a country still worshipping a mass murderer ,  i expect no less .
 so when are they taking down their pirated shows on pps / bilibili and etc ?
 i would recommend talking to those older generations about the japanese occupation ,  pay a visit to memorial at bukit chandu .
 look at how japanese white wash history teaching in their history books .
 they still claim they were trying to liberate us and teaching it to their students
 waiting for jacky chan to visit the shrine
 sounds like certain teaching
 it &apos;s the chinese dna .
 chiu see it in chinese everywhere including singapore hong kong taiwan malaysia and indonesia .
 imagine if the death feedback in shin sekai yori didnt work .
 thats what &apos;s happening in cheena .
 except that oni a few people are powerful .
 which is even worse ,  i know .
 it is like chiu built a temple with 2 thousands famous peoples inside then put hitler and pol pots among them .
 don’t waste your breath la .
 brainwashed pap ibs and brainwashed ccp ibs all the same bunch of people ,  their selective amnesia is terminal stage one
 which happens recently to our trump .
 even past donators to him oso kena .
 still got pirated shows on bilibili meh ?
 thought they actually paid for the rights to stream and show it ?
 in that case ,  the class a criminals originally were not even invited to the shrine .
 someone jio them to come in the 1960 &apos;s n the decision was oni made public in 1979 .
 minus that few year where america was occupying japan n making the decision ,  it must have taken alot of courage for the japanese to honor that group of war dead .
 whereas the benchmark elsewhere is almost immediate (eg .
 ukrainian insurgent army)
 darkness will say .
 why stop at cheering ?
 so long liao ,  got shrines sure got people go what .
 if chiu ah gong is a criminal chiu cannot go ssrr meh ?
 the jipun faults oso ,   so long liao still want act blur .
 just come out say sori like the german la .
 jialat sia want to earn remember .
 cannot even go near anything they dont like .
 i think many sinkies wished their ah mah is dio raped by jippunkia soldiers in their hope of habing jippunkia genes .
 twmm legs very long and shapely

 it’s common everywhere .
 u go cheena for business trip then u will be even more surprise .
 too bad never jio wlh
 she wants to ensure the new guy dont piak and dump her ,  then she will be left with no one .
 listen to all the incels bashing on the girl .
 these type of losers can stay alone forever .
 some girls do need a break  ,  to rest and recuperate and reflect .
 doesnt mean she is seeing another guy .
 dating and relationships can be draining and tiring .
 some people need time with their families and personal stuff too .
 be understanding and give her some space to breathe .
 meanwhile ,  make use of these 2 weeks to reflect upon yourself .
 what have chiu done wrong ?
 how can chiu improve yourself and be a better man ?
 after the 2 week period ,  bounce back and become a better  ,  more loving boyfriend .
 that is how relationships grow stronger .
 ai ya just want to leach husband then say ah .
 dont say life is tiring
 u need to be more alpha .
 ts ,  your gf going spend two weeks staycation with her sugar daddy la .
 remember to use 99% isopropyl alcohol and disinfect the cheese pie inside and outside before doing again hor .
 or else catch some pokemon that chiu dont wan .
 thats the nicer way of telling chiu game over .
 the new guy sure act concerned that u will harm her .
 put all kinds of scenarios in her head .
 actually he just want the breakup to be confirmed so he can bang her without her feeling guilty
 nothing wrong with being  &apos;alpha &apos;  .
 by today &apos;s definition thats just a nice word for selfish behaviour that leads to a lonely life  .
 but this is not what ts and many others want in life
 she probably needs time off .
 should respect her wishes .
 i hope chiu send her greetings like : good morning/good night once in a while to show chiu still care .
 maybe she is/was expecting that - we wouldnt know .
 please do some self reflection .
 recall what have she been saying all the while .
 there should be some hints here and there .
 it &apos;s time to face them and not hide .
 women dont liddat .
 sounds like a car spare tyre .
 don’t need just leave in the trunk .
 just in case main tyre spoil  ,  can deploy backup tyre .
 if no backup  ,  later main tire got problems  ,  she will be left stranded
 no count down new year party for ts
 they call it pokerus .
 no quarrel meh ?
 this is more of a ,  trying to persuade yourself to be more positive .
 and when s*** happens ,  chiu blame yourself for not  &apos;reflecting &apos; better or not  &apos;more loving bf &apos;  .
 i mean truth to be told la .
 in a relationship there isnt  &apos;i need a break &apos; if she blatantly say that means either u screw up some where ,  she had enough of your s*** ,  and wants some alone time while looking or find another white knight to seek attention from .
 so the son she dont want custody ?
 uncle seen and been through all these bs .
 must protect our bros here
 there &apos;s always 2 sides of the fences .
 even if the girl called for 2 weeks break ,  it is very easy to see after the 2 weeks if she is keen on continuing the relationship .
 especially if the couple is young ,  i dont think they are level headed enough to sit down and discuss through at least major issues in the relationship .
 unfortunately the negative outcome seems to be the more common one .
 all the naive chao sinkies bbfas edmwers white knight come liao .
 ask for 2 weeks break  .
 u still gong gong msg good morn good night  .
 while she enjoy with new guy .
 and u self reflect and improve ?
 white knights - just listen to uncle and all here .
 all been through that bs

 oredi said not clicking liao .
 why keep posting ?
 u having psychotic episode ?
 in mar ,  think a delivery person open mai package .
 parent said the packaged was delivered open .
 inconsistent service ,  my amazon package delivered & left outside gate without any notification .
 i oni knew it was delivered when the email came asking for feedback on that delivery .
 lucky not stolen 
 let &apos;s see how long this takes .
 departed ninja van warehouse - in transit .
 frequent online shopper here as well .
 i would rate qxpress(by far)-->jt-->ninja van-->singpost .
 why i would rate singpost worst of the lot is cos it is still possible for your packages delivered to go missing ,  or simply suka suka left@ your doorstep in a shophouse/regular hdb .
 this wont happen with the other 3 .
 turtlevan delivery timings are the worst for sure though .
 what is worse their estimated delivery timing is sibei buay zhun .
 they come when they feel like it .
 however before we complain ,  ask ourselves how much are we paying for shipping ?
 if u use shopee ,  shipping is like 1 .
 49 ,  and frequently free for many items .
 lazada often 49 cents .
 turtlevan takes long yes ,  at least the packages will get to chiu .
 if u need urgently ,  just buy from qoo10 when possible .
 the choice is sorta there .
 mah hiam buay pai la ,  u guys are just sitting on your sofa watching tv and moving fingers on phone for this .
  if shipping everytime cost 5-6 bucks and fast ,  i am pretty sure everyone up in arms the cost of buying online is unaffordable .
 this never happens in tiong bahru area .
 oredi say its ninja .
 u need to find them
 j&t express is worst then ninjavan .
 omg their hotline is useless .
 my parcel stuck in their warehouse for so long still havent delivery out
 on the occasional time i got j&t ,  they were ok .
 i just purchased an item for ninjapoint collection .
 fingers crossed it &apos;s not full and have to bounce around to diff collection points which happened to me more than once earlier this year or end of last year .
 oh fxxx ,  jinxed it ,  after posting the previous post ,  i really received the email to reselect .
 somehow the 7-11s near me always full one wtf .
 ditto this ,  singpost is the oni one i have experienced item delivered invisibility .
 end up is deliver to mailbox .
 my ninjavan was supposed to be redelivered today .
 ended up mia without any calls/sms cause technical issue system down ,  no driver assigned .
 dunno why watsons still choose ninjavan .
 so far its been ok for me .
 knn i bought a faulty item from shopee and has to arrange a ninjavan myself to pickup and return this faulty item back to the merchant  .
 in the first place i don’t understand why it’s not the merchant creating a pickup to collect from me but never mind i try .
 so i created a business account ,  as this is my first time using ninjavan ,  there is no user guide ,  shopee has no user guide oso ,  so i saw a pickup option on ninja ,  and i thought ninjavan was so simple to use ,  create a pickup ,  the date and the time ,  and under the instruction just input the merchant name and where to delivery ,  and it’s so simple ,  and somemore it is free and even though i’m sure someone has to pay it but there was no option to make any payment at all .
 so the ninja came ,  and asked me for the paper ?
 i was like what paper ?
 so what paper was the ninja referring ?
 anyway he was oso not sure how to get the paper oso ,  and so he left and asked me to print the paper first before arranging another pick up lol .
 it’s so funny ,  where do i find the paper ?
 i called the hotline ,  it say technical issue ,  asked to email them .
 i emailed them ,  no reply until 1 day later .
 the support is zero
 so many fake deliveries .
 how does the company benefit ?
 ninjavan is terrible .
 i think they have a very bad case of internal theft .
 recently lost one of my parcel ,  a high value item (lens worth ~$1400) .
 claimed to have delivered but instead delivered a parcel from another order .
 5 months of investigation still cannot find the parcel ,  in the end have to refund me .
 i heard when such things happen they will have to compensate the platform ,  in this instance lazada .
 how does this even happen ?
 i think ninjavan is surviving cos they have exclusive some tie-up with shopee .
 try creating a shop in shopee (less than 10 clicks) and creating a random listing .
 chiu will realise that chiu are forced to use ninjavan .
 no self-collect nor any other alternative shipping .
 i have no idea about lazada cos it feels more scammy than shopee; never tried .
 i think their service sucks real bad cos they employ stereotypical young punks with no mangement oversight .
 see heavily modified delivery vans ?
 likely to be ninjavan .
 my latest ninja van parcel damn cb ,  i put instruction to place item inside riser beside my unit if no one is home ,  they just put it outside my door like rubbish .
 the item is quite small ,  they don’t even try to slot it between the gate and wooden door ,  they just let it lay outside my unit .
 no message before delivery as well .
 so far j&t still my favourite ,  they read instruction
 how about best inc  ?
 speedpost cannot deliver ,  divert to best .
 j&t so good meh ?
 my mother would tell me no ,  not like this 1 .
 companies will oni allow chiu to take leave up to the number of days based on ratio of days that chiu worked for the year .
 like 14 ,  will need to divide by the number of working days in a year ,  and then times the number of days that chiu worked to get the number of days of leave that chiu are allowed to take at that time of the year .
 is like this 1 meh ?
 i always thought ,  once the year start ,  can 1 shot take all liao ?
 u just pay back the number of days u exceeded your pro ration lor .
 depends on company policy .
 whether prorated or not
 can take all la .
 just pay back if chiu quit the job and your taken leave exceeds pro rated allowance
 but generally your reporting officer won’t let chiu take so much leave at one shot la .
 low pay and high competition with ft
 isn’t is oredi liddat ?
 yes ,  once the low hanging fruits are plucked
 other industry still have many unfilled vacancies hard to find people
 it outlook should be worse .
 they can outsource entirely to a team in india silicon valley and dunnid any to be physically here .
 it is oredi happened ,  and even some operations can be easily outsource to oversea easily .
 hence chiu will see alot joker inside this industry .
 everything is a bubble la .
 once supply outstrip demand .
 the same thing will happen .
 but not everything can be outsourced .
 some are just too sensitive to follow outsource model
 it might even be worse .
 engineering cannot be smoked ,  thats why people say it is hard to study .
 and thats their oni redeeming point which is the technical interviews .
 see how many companies outsourced engineering to india .
 then see how many oredi outsourced it to india .
 one of the most low ses crimes i heard of

 think what is amazing is all along it didnt happen much ,  but now that mass vaccination ,  when many none the wiser vaxxed assumed its safer ,  it happens .
 its like magic .
 sbs buses dont use same state of the art aircon system like smrt trains ?
 lta should upgrade all their systems to who hoe jinx advocates
 please dont project your love for your ah mah on others .
 lmao tiongs sibei strawberry sia 
 actually it isn’t  .
 simple buy and simple sell .
 the money pays for the product .
 cheena is the oni country that expects additional conditions that are unreasonable and wrong at the same time ,  and somehow they ain’t ashamed of that .
 the way they promote vaccination despite fatalities after vaccination and infecting covid (due to underlying conditions) is always the low probability and percentage .
 it is like they always think that low percentage won’t be themselves or the ones they are promoting to .
 since changed hand .
 how many uplorry oredi .
 means the eight word not heavy ?
 he out of sight ,  out of mind .
 covid put spotlight on him .
 last time some deaths were declared as not covid mah
 gan is no blame culture huan marrr .
 we know the reason but cannot say .
 gan is so much better .
 no death better right
 different boss different way of doing stuff lar
 no change oso will be the same
 the ye kung more useless than gan boyong
 if put him as minister of foreign affairs suspect we kena war soon
 doesnt matter ,  protocol is we will still open legs welcome ceca .
 vivid variant ceca
 gotch deaths budden say unrelated more better .
 no blame culture  .
 ceca variant really as irritating as ceca themselves .
 persistent to screw everyone &apos;s life .
 gan is bo yong but he really looks like one of these .
 cos the criteria now changed liao .
 last time anything oso cannot be died from covid .
 now is every death if unvax mean is by covid .
 if u read carefully between the lines .
 they indirectly admitting that covid is now airborne .
 cos in an enclosed aircon space where air is circulated ,  it spreads .
 but it doesnt spread in a place where there is constant flow of fresh air .
 for chiu not hard la .
 nothing to lose ,  no money no honey hkc
 risks mitigation where possible ,  unvax are subjected to severe illnesses if they contracted covid .
 infrastructure cannot support that many icu cases if all of unvax come down with serious illnesses today ,  the hospitals will be overwhelmed .
 that why unvaxx are not encouraged to join activities or enter places where the virus can be highly transmissible
 then there is no explanation how the market /hawker clusters are so much bigger then the non-existent sbs/mrt aircon environment eh ?
 do chiu take off your mask in mrt or buses 
 if they think sinovac is safe for go dining ,  why not put  under the national vaccination programme ?
  if they think the sinovac efficacy is low ,  why they allowed ?
 this is not based on science .
 it is all about gdp  .
 u die your problem
 my moderna is an unwise choice ?
 hi oyk ,  please pofma this guy thanks .
 this discrimination argument is really some sjw level of argument .
 i thought edmw-ers were better than that .
 in before people ask .
 how come coffee shop no natural ventilation covid cannot spread
 in times of hardship ,  chiu will society for what they really are .
 have a good look around everyone .
 actually the unvax ones are the atas ,  those with spending power .
 so if u want to treat unvax customer bosses to nice restaurant ,  what would they think ?
 u straight away lose that customer .
 so fb difficult .
 scared of rules ,  no business .
 probably they arent as smart as chiu .
 chiu ,  on the other hand ,  are a champ .
 chiu took the risk of injecting an experimental non vaccine (since it is non sterilizing) ,  non fda approved ,  no liabity .
 chiu have alot of common sense in doing so .
 it oso shows your dedication to gahment agenda for mass vaccination .
 chiu have helped a gahment which has a good track record in implementing policies like importing cxxx and says common sense stuff like cotton comes from sheep .
 chiu ,  sir ,  are awesome af .
 everyday will check in a while to see the vax vs unvax arguments for a little lol .
 walan chiu people nothing better to do with your life is it ?
 the unknown man: .
 - hawker centres and coffeeshops are open air so they are safer .
 - hold my beer 
 discrimination and segregation of people for their own personal agenda .
 this will happen cos infected vax can sit and yak long long unmasked in restaurant .
 just over 3wks ,  over 1k full vax infected .
 haha then better dont reopen .

 did chiu have to write a 1000 word essay in mandarin as per their requirements ?
 and they like your house and car  its a trade
 enjoy your bbfa life then .
 just make more bbfa friends and go bbfa tour in cheena .
 my 1000 word essay was done in engrish .
 the master of management is conducted entirely in engrish with 4 chinese modules
 how &apos;s this plain jane ?
 nicely done ,  was considering to go over but apparently recommendation letters are necessary which i dont have 
 nice try bro ,  your rice media beedio says otherwise .
 yes ,  i was lucky that two professors who taught me during my undergraduate was willing to vouch for my ability and wrote strong recommendation letters for me
 this one not plain jane meh ?
 this notch plain jane   
 then what is plain jane 
 still got so many years toctry
 google chiur best fwen 
 i have gpgt before and dont be surprised that some of the plain jane have ultra high requirements cos high cost of living and more guys in their country than girls ,  so wide variety of options .
 high value items should just deliver to collection point .
 then can just collect at your convenience and no risk of ghost delivery .
 beware of using collection point as the item can go ninja as well .
 it really happened and oni way out was to get a full refund .
 waiting long better then having an item lost .
 dont have those 7-11 or buzz shop options ?
 not the lockers kind .
 i was once asked to pick another collection point cos the 7-11 i chose was at its  &apos;full capacity &apos; .
 parcel got delayed in the process ,  of course .
 just to talk about recent deliveries ,  ninja was taking an extremely long time to change from  &apos;on the way &apos; and upon query ,  told me they lost the parcel .
 got a refund but .
 on the other hand ,  j&t delivered my parcel the next day after its arrival into singapore .
 yup ,  i &apos;d think twice about using those ninja points these days .
 ninjavan is run by geniuses .
 i ordered 3 boxes of the same thing .
 they arrange to come in 3 separate deliveries .
 job creation ftw
 lol ninjavan said they &apos;ve delivered but no items .
 if  order from a shopee seller ,  and  &apos;ninja van (home delivery) &apos; is the oni option .
 is it possible for me to choose this option ,  but set the delivery address to a ninja point (such as a 7-11) instead ,  so that i can pick up from there .
   has anyone tried this before ,  and does that work ?
 chiu do realise this is a complaint thread about ninja service right ?
 chiu wanna see how far they can go extra mile ah ?
 moved to aljunied recently and the ninjas here usually come during late morning and delivery has been quite fast .
 better than when i was in tpy .
 j&t has been reliable too as usual .
 better than singpost .
 90% put a note on yr door say no body at hm .
 please collect your parcel at singpost shop .
 tey im at hm leh .
 u didnt even ring my door bell .
 if the seller’s mode of delivery is by ninja van .
 yeah same waiting for 3 .
 5 hours now the driver is driving everywhere around me but to my blk .
 i was previously super excited about my new phone when i got their msg saying driver is near get ready 3 .
 5 hours ago now im dead worried that it will get lost or put in the wrong house
 got pcc outside your unit or not siol
 still better than j&t .
 this is not how a relationship grow stronger .
 this is avoiding the issues in the relationship .
 for relationship to grow stronger ,  both parties need to communicate and not take a break .
 if my then gf told me that we needed a break ,  i would told her im not coming back .
 if there &apos;s issues to be resolved ,  it has to be resolved in ways of communications and both parties needs to understand one another in order to grow stronger .
 either after two weeks ,  chiu have new girl or she has new boyfriend .
 either way ,  she &apos;s going to tell everyone all your bad traits that made her walk away .
 if she want 2 weeks break to recuperate ,  she will tell chiu her plans for the 2 weeks .
 if she want 2 weeks to  &apos;experiment &apos; ,  she wont contact chiu at all cos she &apos;s on  &apos;get out of jail free &apos; period .
 chiu have to decide yourself if you &apos;re willing to be back up option when she comes back to find chiu .
 and even if she did ,  no promise she wont pull the same stunt when another potential candidate comes along .
 i recommend chiu busy yourself with best friends and family over this december festive seasons ,  treat yourself and look forward to bonus and a clean 2021 start .
 wtf got break one meh ?
 ask her to delay the 2 week break then piak all chiu can before it start/break
 chiu really is a beta to think liddat .
 a man do not need a woman to be successful ,  a woman is supposed to compliment a man &apos;s life .
 well society has changed alot now but .
 at the very least ,  the man is supposed to be the leader and in control of the relationship .
 communications is key to all kinds of relationships .
 better to be single than to deal with such low quality/unloyal/scheming woman who play mind games .
 chiu continue to think liddat chiu will keep meeting such woman and waste precious time with them .
 congrats ts for earning the green beret !
 bro there are alot of wussies in singapore .
 u see everywhere .
 walking with kids bag pram etc .
 wife play handphone
 listen to all the uncles and bbfas advice here .
 no white knight fake positivity go reflect and improve yourself bullsheet .
 then meanwhile still send good morn night msgs take care mags etc .
 despite concerns with efficacy ,  the gahment is willing to extend flexibilities to sinovac vaccinations cos most of us are oredi vaccinated with what they consider to be the superior mrna vaccines .
 for the remaining unvaxed group ,  better that they have some vaccination than none at all .
 sinovac is still being evaluated for inclusion in the national vaccination programme after the manufacturer finally provided the extra data requested for .
 but this approval is less important now in terms of dining out etc .
 point is ,  if oni vax go jiak restaurants ,  likelihood to tio is lower .
 whereas ,  those unvax go coffeeshop and spread ,  will all self-pwn .
 thats why next 2-4 weeks ,  icu will need to work overtime liao .
 then the lift leh ?
 no chiu are wrong .
 cannot liddat say .
 im a loner ssfa with no one else but i jab long time ago .
 my colleague have a happy family and an obedient studious child but he die die dont want to jab regardless whether it is mrna or not .
 usually those who got family one will scare to jab cos they dont want anything bad to happen after they jab and leave their happy family behind ,  especially if they have underlying health condition .
 people like me not so scare to die one will just jab .
 whether chiu live or die is predestined .
 in restaurant ,  we need to unmask and eat .
 possible to eat without talking ?
 alone ,  it &apos;s possible .
 wanna try stand within 1feet a covid patient for 15 to 30 minutes with mask on and see if u will kena ?
 why are u targetting me ?
 i am pro vaxxer .
 everyone one here knows .
 i am pro gahment oso .
 cotton comes from sheep ,  right ?
 i will eat and talk to myself .
 haha what a joke .
 80% of the people are vaccinated on case chiu didnt know .
 same as why coffeeshop cannot sell beer after 1030 but satki pub and restoran can
 i dont get your point here .
 if your wife was allergic to the 1st dose of mrna vaccine then she surely would have been referred to get sinovac instead ,  cos that is the oni alternative at this time .
  so she does have a way out ,  it is whether she chooses to opt for sinovac or not .
 whether sinovac is part of the programme or not is secondary since your initial question was about dining out in her situation ?
 if she goes for sinovac then yes she is considered to be vaccinated ?
 if not then no until the measures get changed again .
 just boycott all those restaurants
 dine in or take away not that important .
  if sinovac is protect enough for covid ,  then include them ,  and just allow citizen to take it for free and oso covered under the vaccine injury financial assistance programme for covid vaccination .
 if like what singapore’s director of medical services kenneth mak had said in june that the sinovac vaccine carries some risk of a person being infected despite taking the jabs ,  based on evidence from other countries .
 they should be treat like not fully vaccinated .
 most ironic thing is pappies have been shutting down hawker centres all these while .
 now say hawker centres are ok .
 as of today it is 65 .
 8% fully vaxxed and 77 .
 not even close to 80% fully vaxxed .
 get your facts right .
 experts got say they will still be experts even after giving useless remarks ?
 the experts cmi sia .
 havnt happen didnt predict ,  happen liao then say will happen more often .
 liddat my grandma and 5 year old nephew can be expert too .
 need to detour walk outside the interchange area  ?
 why not test all bus drivers ?
 why stop at interchange oni ,  and not the buses and mrt ?
 who drive the buses ?
 either the gahment dunno ,  or they know it very well and putting people in a big risk to open up the economy .
 whichever it is ,  it has lost it &apos;s credibility .
 the resilys may be something tio big ti accept .
 if 80% of the bus drivers infected ,  no one will drive the buses .
 then mrt oso infected .
 no one dare take .
 endemic plans up in smoke again .
 seriously i don’t wish to hear anything from these ownself claim ownself experts
 soon we would start seeing mrt cases .
 it matter of time when staffs got tested .
 just open up in september ,  100% back to office and allow tourists back in .
 it &apos;s endemic ,  no one cares about clusters or who gets infected .
 if not testing now .
 when fire burn the whole house down then spray water ?
 fyi this is not a prediction ,  its common sense .
 can 160 hire me as expert ?
 probably just hoping all is well and limited .
 if the gahment want to test ,  wont keep silent for so long .
 would have ordered for it within a day or 2 .
 this concerns public commuting ,  where tens ofthousands passengers riding on buses driven by infected bus drivers .
 infected passengers may oso hop on to trains ,  shopping malls or offices .
 people go out for a reason .
 by taking so long to call for tests ,  or even identifying the passengers (ezlink card or tt) ,  can assume no urgency .
 they said endemic
 i oso want all to be ok .
  what i mean was currently still able to contain .
 we need to contain and stop spreading .
 as many passengers boarding public transport daily .
 even so nowadays as malls are more connected to mrt and bus interchanges .
 anyone could be super spreader .
 if tt is working .
 it should reduce the manual work of contact tracing .
 new study in the field by experts ,  shows that the experts are correct and fact checked by the experts
 timing ,  gan was dealing with version 1 .
 delta is more infectious ,  viral load builds up very quickly reducing the amount of prep time .
 one try not to do anything so wont make mistake ,  one want to prove himself so keep pushing limit and make dangerous decisions
 the one took over suay
 he unbutton his shirt chiu will know .
 he hot tattoo the covid vaccine god on his chest .
 think he taking ippt 2 .
 push limit until peng san
 last time unvaccinated die due to underlying health condition .
 now unvaccinated die to being unvaccinated .
 this is the message they sending to people ,  its all politics .
 am sick of life ,  am sick of chiu ,  why should i say hi ?
 i will move on until when i deem enuf .
 singapore should allow people to choose ,  clinical assisted suicide should be legal and allow .
 so when time comes i &apos;ll pay the ticket price and say bye bye .
 oh i know some eu country it is legal ,  mebbe save enuf ,  will fly over and die .
 rent a cheaper room .
 left 5 months to go bro
 i am not surprised that people feel this way with people like chiu on the internet .
 did chiu ever consider your comments on other threads might cause some people to feel this way ?
 the irony that chiu write such awful things about people chiu dunno ,  then hope others feel better when they are down .
 modern stressors such as internet trolls and bullies are precisely why some people cant cope with life .
 think about that for a minute .
 without singapore they cannot survive huan    .
 the prices there not cheap .
 to sinkies is cheap cos divide by 3 .
 most restaurants in their mall cost about 30rm for a meal .
 for alot of them it &apos;s like half a day pay oredi .
 how to afford ?
 down the drain .
 who said that they can survive without sinkies ?
 there was a time ,  when people said that jb cmi without sinkies ,  and they can &apos;t
 johor bahru &apos;s paradigm mall was abandoned for almost 20 years .
 it &apos;s now sparkly and new .
 built as kemayan city long time ago
 they can achieve !
 they dont want to survive ,  they blamed us for jacking the price up .
 now they are so happy cos everywhere have discounts and promotions .
 this is what they wanted right from the start and they got it now 
 they never go film r&f mall ?
 or the dead r&f condos ?
 johor citizens have their wishes come true
 i am surprised still got some stores open .
 no customers for so long liao
 sinkie supporting jb ?
 in the past ,  yes .
 jhk working in singapore and living in jb are the ones propping jb economy nowadays .
 johor residents should rejoice mah !
 nobody go there spoil market up their cost of living .
 nobody go petrol station shake the car .
 i thought thats what they wishing for all these while ?
 dunnid sinkies go in spend mah ,  why worry ?
 lesser crime oso right ?
 now all of them thinking of how to capture singapore 2 pointy points ?
 they chased us away ,  they dont want sinkies to jack up their standard of living .
 now they got what they wanted ,  all to themselves .
 when we can go back they better treat us like kings hor .
 knn dont keep saying we drive up their prices liao .
 but sinkies oso please remember this video and dont squeeze and ask for too much discounts la .
 remember ,  kings dont ask for petty discounts
 many of their spouse still in singapore earning 1:3  .
 so they still have the power of 3 to spend right ?
 without the crowd some more
 who farking need who more ?
 so difficult to read .
 really follow miw typical style .
 change for the sake of changing .
 eg ,  dig up tiles n rebuilt same tile .
 kuala lumpur ,  oct 26 — former prime minister datuk seri najib razak has filed a civil lawsuit against former attorney-general tan sri tommy thomas and the malaysian gahment for having pressed 35 criminal charges against him in four trials ,  claiming that the then attorney general had allegedly abused his powers to prosecute him .
 in the lawsuit filed on october 22 in the high court in kuala lumpur ,  najib is claiming for a declaration that thomas had committed misfeasance in public office ,  and rm1 , 941 , 988 (or rm1 .
 9 million) to compensate for the alleged losses that he had suffered so far ,  general damages ,  exemplary damages and aggravated damages .
 in the breakdown of the alleged rm1 .
 9 million loss suffered by najib so far ,  these were listed in his statement of claim as rm310 , 115 for “medical expenses suffered due to anxiety and stress caused by the prosecutions” ,  rm1 , 005 , 200 for “consultation fees for audit team to perform documentation review in order to prepare the facts to face the prosecutions” ,  rm56 , 673 for “travel expenses from september 2018 to date incurred in relation to fighting the court charges” ,  rm90 , 000 for “wasted costs due to being unable to travel overseas due to the conditions of the bail imposed” ,  and rm480 , 000 for “engagement of other services ,  including security personnel and clerical staff in dealing with the charges” .
 when contacted by malay mail ,  lawyer yudistra darma dorai — from the law firm who had filed the lawsuit for najib — confirmed that the lawsuit has been filed ,  but said it has yet to be served on those being sued .
 what najib is claiming .
 based on najib’s statement of claim ,  he is suing thomas for allegedly having committed the tort of misfeasance in public office and the tort of malicious abuse of process and the tort of negligence .
 he was oso suing for the malaysian gahment to be held vicariously liable or liable for thomas’ alleged wrongs in his capacity then as a gahment servant .
 in the lawsuit ,  najib claimed that the 35 criminal charges that he is facing in four cases were allegedly part of a “long planned ,  premeditated exercise” by thomas ,  citing various views since 2012 which najib attributed to thomas as well as various events .
 among other things ,  najib claimed that thomas had “consistently been prejudiced” against him even before his appointment as attorney-general and during and after his tenure as attorney-general .
 thomas was malaysia’s attorney-general from june 2018 until his resignation on february 28 ,  2020 following a change in gahment from pakatan harapan to perikatan nasional .
 citing the list of events that had happened in the past as well as thomas’ past comments ,  najib claimed that thomas had used his former position as attorney-general to act “wrongfully ,  maliciously ,  and in bad faith” against him .
 najib oso claimed that thomas had been negligent in publishing statements that would allegedly prejudice and affect najib’s ongoing trials .
 in claiming that thomas committed misfeasance as attorney-general ,  najib claimed that thomas had allegedly abused his powers by allegedly prejudging his case before deciding to prosecute him ,  allegedly failing to study the case against him independently and objectively ,  allegedly interfering with investigations and allegedly acting maliciously and in bad faith .
 najib oso claimed that the prosecutions against him were not done according to the law and due process and natural justice .
 najib claimed that thomas was allegedly negligent and oppressive ,  oso alleging that thomas had breached his duty as a former attorney-general to not make sub judice comments that would influence and impact ongoing criminal trials .
 najib oso claimed that he had lost his constitutional protection under the federal constitution’s article 8 — which provides for equality before the law and equal protection of the law — by thomas’ actions ,  alleging that thomas had allegedly discriminated against him by purportedly treating the allegations against him differently from other cases .
 najib claimed that the alleged wrongdoings had resulting in him suffering “loss of reputation and injury to his political career” as a prominent politician ,  with his lawsuit listing him as being the son of malaysia’s second prime minister ,  having first became an mp in 1976 ,  being a former pahang chief minister ,  having held senior cabinet positions since 1986 ,  and who was “also a prominent public figure in foreign countries and commanded the respect of foreign leaders such as barack obama ,  xi jinping ,  narendra modi and donald trump” .
 najib oso claimed to have suffered the loss of liberty during custody for investigations by the authorities ,  and to oso have suffered “pain ,  suffering and trauma” ,  and alleged that all such losses listed have continued .
 najib then went on to detail what he was claiming for ,  including the rm1 .
 9 million payment to pay for a specific breakdown of losses incurred .
 in the statement of claim ,  najib made it clear that his lawsuit was oni in relation to the four criminal cases where he is facing 35 charges ,  and not in relation to a fifth case where he is facing seven charges in relation to former 1malaysia development berhad (1mdb) subsidiary src international sdn bhd’s rm42 million .
 the src case is where najib had been convicted and sentenced in the high court ,  and which he had appealed to the court of appeal .
 the court of appeal has heard his appeal but has yet to deliver its decision in the src case .
 the four criminal cases which najib is alleging to be wrongful prosecution are the trial where he is facing 21 money-laundering charges and four power abuse charges involving more than rm2 billion of 1mdb funds ,  his joint trial with former treasury secretary-general tan sri mohd irwan serigar abdullah involving six criminal breach of trust charges over rm6 .
 6 billion of gahment funds ,  a trial where he is facing one power abuse charge in relation to alleged instructions given to amend the auditor-general’s 1mdb audit report before it was presented to parliament’s public accounts committee ,  and three money-laundering charges involving rm27 million of src funds .
 out of these four cases ,  two are ongoing ,  namely the 1mdb trial with the next hearing date to be on november 9 ,  while the trial involving the 1mdb audit report — and which is being heard together with former 1mdb ceo arul kanda kandasamy who was accused of abetting najib in the alleged power abuse — is currently set to resume in march next year .
 the two other trials — the joint trial with irwan serigar and the rm27 million money-laundering case — have yet to start ,  in order to give way for the ongoing trials to be heard first .

 i 45yo oso never kaopeh
 paiseh to derail thread .
 but are guys aversive to girls who make the first move ?
 esp one who he barely knows >2yrs never talk and barely any interactions before (kinda knew from school orientation)  .
 not intending to drop a bomb out of the blue ,  but just reaching out to ask if we can be friends
 actually most users are pretty accurate ,  eg .
 mly ,  at pointing out that looks are secondary for girls .
 just speaking from personal experience ,  the person i crushed on  barely ticks the ideal physical traits i have in mind ,  but it was just a fleeting feeling that caught me in this whirlpool for a good few years lol .
 one thing though ,  is feeling oni lets chiu put one foot in the door ,  dunnid to be andy lau yandao or ultra muscular ,  just neat and clean should be fine  .
 dont lose hope !
 that still a hard requirement ?
 not really but must be subtle .
 if not not feminine and decreases attraction .
 be friends to guys = friendzone try asking him out without mentioning friend
 2 weeks come back congrats chiu are a father now
 yes society has changed alot .
 role is switching .
 man behaving more feminine and woman taking the role of alpha .

 sexpect this week break wouldnt be the last 
 damn right got these kind of white knight

 then ask to meet up to rekindle the romance .
 dont be a beta cuck coolie gene who cried out and beg for forgiveness when chiu meet her .
 i will give her 2 years  .
 i believe the answer will be out in 1 month  .
 girls can be real b1tches at times .
 huai so long then oni 1 white knight cum out .
  unkle is waiting for chiu

 i got delivery message in morning but havent send yet  
 don’t anyhow say ok .
 they quite screw up .
 called the cs and was told my item delayed to next day even though i told them system says will deliver today .
 item eventually was delivered on that day but at 9 .
 they basically clueless about what their drivers are doing .
 singpost comes in and say ,  leave ye amateur
 all delivery quite same same expect chiu to wait from 9am-9pm ,  except those like qoo10 prime delivery in which chiu can select a short period time slot and they truly delivered within that short time slot
 ninjavan is ok la .
 11 received oredi somemore is peak season
 got mine yesterday in the end so all is good  
 depending on which van delivery driver .
 it seems that there are some that  &apos;keng &apos; .
 they deliberately indicate the parcel as undeliverable (even though it is to a collection point) ,  then the parcel is pushed to another slot and became the problem of another co-worker .
 it is basically the type of office politics chiu experienced at work co-worker that  &apos;keng &apos; will push away their work to other co-workers to do .
 they just dump the box outside your house de .
 too bad amazon .
 i order something from lazada .
 and the online shop got a physical shop .
 and i ask the seller if i can go down to collect instead .
 lazada dont allow that .
 ninja van collect the parcel .
 i email them to send to a collection point .
 but they sent to my home and miss the first delivery as i was working and no one at home .
 had to email them again to remind them .
 really sibei poor service .
 wonder why lazada didnt allow self collection .
 liddat is it lppl ?
 i would have self collect 5 days ago and save all the trouble .
 my past experiences from their deliveries not bad but not for j&t
 very good liao .
 but they send girl to deliver my 20kg item  ,  i went out to help
 still pending pick up by ninja van  .
 i feel nowadays ninjavan is the lesser evil oredi .
 at least they bother to contact and leave items at the riser .
 singpost is **** brain seriously .
 didnt inform and just leave the parcel at the door step .
 yes ,  send sms to say that i allowed them to do so when i never authorise .
 these few days quite jialat keep raining
 these experts are clearly wrong !
 covid no ez-link card cannot take mrt and bus .
 so bus interchange won’t kena .
 chiu can gong jiao wey or not ?
 please explain why covid needs the travel card ?
 when chiu carry your bag into the train do chiu buy a travel card for the bag ?
 today guess which bus interchange kena ?
 sir i was being sarcastic lol .
 remember when covid was sibei hiong last year the pap sibei stubborn dont want to do safe distancing on bus/mrt ?
 expected one mah .
 no need expert oso knows
 bus infected means passenger infected liao mah .
 wherever they go ,  bus ,  mrt ,  shopping malls ,  home ,  school .
 tt should pick up random places of close contact i guess .
 but endemic la ,  we should expect more cases with mild symptoms .
 take care everybody .
 your honour ,  not that i didnt know that it is one but when read too many times then someone just need to post a anti-sacarsm remark .
 soon all bus interchange will have cluster ?
 like how pm said soon everyone will get covid .
 everyday add 1 interchange ,  not more not less   
 guess those experts are still adamant that the virus will not spread in public transport
 yeah ,  come clap for our experts for saying something edmwers said long ago    .
 it &apos;s common sense mah ,  no need to be experts to know it 
 aiyo chiu guys better dont take bus la .
 take taxi la .
 good for your health and good for my part time cab driving .
 so next couple days everyday will +1 bus interchange .
 moi was thinking yesterday boon lay still safe .
 then today news boon lay down .
 means no need wear condom oredi right  ?
 want to live together means we must fully embrace raw .
 who renamed it to stis
 no wonder st index limped like fark
 this kind of cyclist must kena one time then will learn
 i hope he brings panadols along wib him 
 how come no drivers warn him that cycling on expressway is not allowed
 i will long horn him 
 dont understand ,  where exactly is this ?
 looks familiar he oredi on pie liao ?
 cyclists need to be licensed and have their licence plates displayed on their bicycle so that they will be more responsible when riding their bicycle .
 hope he dont bite the dust .
 if he is sinkie ,  i propose to send him to do cwo at orchard pick litter for 2 week or option for him to chose 3 days jail .
 really super man .
 dont understand how can people do it .
 obviously can feel danger .
 why they still go ahead and do it
 i thought they dont allow
 but i heard ebikes can change their number plate to fake 1
 this one is cyclist trap ,  most likely he gged himself when he didnt turn out at sims ave .
 its a good 300m away then will know is expressway .
 is this sims ave towards kpe ?
 never travelled here before
 so basically ,  when moi flying back to singapore from warsaw in dec 2019 ,  moi met this sinkie gerl .
 she was sitted beside moi ,  but separated by the aisle .
 we started chitchatting and hit it off very well ,  then the angmo sitting beside moi offer to change seat with her so she can sit beside moi instead .
 she told moi she was a sota student ,  then parents send her to uk to stardee music upon graduation .
 throughout the flight ,  she keeped compraining very cold ,  so moi lend her jacket .
 then she say tired ,  keep wanting to doze off liddat ,  her head keep leaning and tilting towards moi ,  so moi said it &apos;s hok if she want to put her head on moi shoulder ,  dont worry about it .
 then when we disembarked ,  moi helped her carry her luggage and stuff to her daddy &apos;s car and we sexchanged phone number .
 then later ,  she texted moi saying her daddy sayed moi &apos;s a gentleman ,  very dateable .
 we continued texting for around a month ,  then she went back uk in jan 2020 ,  but subsequently neber keep in touch oredi .
 moi is now wondering ,  if moi suddenly go and text her now ,  out of the blue ,  will it freak her out or not ?
 better do your due diligence and ensure she maintains the same or lower bmi to avoid disappointment .

 why would anyone want their mouth ,  throat ,  esophagus ,  gut/stomach ,  small intestines filled and coated with candy ,  sweet liquid ,  all forms of sugar  ?
 i rather stuff mine with chicken ,  green vegetables ,  capsicum ,  garlic ,  onions ,  ginger ,  fruits ,  salmon ,  prawn ,  crab ,  oats ,  cod liver oil ,  sunflower seeds ,  walnuts ,  almonds ,  raisin ,  prunes ,  red dates ,  goji berries ,  ginseng ,  soup ,  plain water .

 they always say be careful what chiu wish for .

 if not for sinkies or jhk who work in singapore n commute back to jb ,  the shops oso wont survive
 they deserve it
 still remb post covid they launched alot of new big malls suddenly … .
 everyone jump in the bandwidth and open shops … .
 now all toh like dominos… .
 even established jonker street in melaka oso can fold up
 this is not lowyat forum .
  please dont make their problems our problems .

 today i think ninjavan overtime ,  all my parcel delivered today haha
 all my parcels via ninjavan oso delivered n received today liao .
 considered fast oredi .
 anyone know where is the  &apos;mobile station at blk 232 compassvale walk loading bay (11 .
 went to the 232 compassvale walk to look for self-collect boxed but failed .
 is it some kind of move-around van and oni will be there for that 1130-1200 30minutes time  ?
 i went there at 7pm .
 this ninja van delivery  .
 jitao just throw your item at your doorstep and they ninja away .
 lesser evil compared to singpost - no knock just put one slip to self collect ,  they didnt even bring the parcel up ,  i caught them on my camera .
 this cb ,  say out for delivery but deliver 3 days later .
 singapore courier delivery is just **** .
 last 2 parcels from amazon .
 singapore left outside door without a sound~ jinja ninja 
 i prefer this oso easier to collect at your own time .
 but not all lazada item can do this leh .
 if chiu bother to ask the seller that .
 and want to go down to self-collect .
 just ask the seller to reserve for chiu .
 then chiu go down to physical shop to buy .
 chiu order through lazada of course have to go through lazada process la .
 chiu go through lazada .
 lazada have to charge the seller comm one .
 for them to accede to chiu request of self-collect is alot more work ,  they need to talk to lazada customer service to tell ninjavan or whatever  logistic to cancel ,  then to treat it as seller deliver ownself .
 then need to show proof oso .
 if not lazada will treat the sales as never went through .
 so chiu say la .
 why would the seller want to go through all that trouble and still have to pay lazada comm .
 next time just call or message them to reserve it then chiu go down purchase la .
 ninjva always provided almost next day delivery for me .
 sucks ,  my item ready for pick up since 9am sat ,  until now no pick up .
 i oso requsted for drop off but they still left it in the raiser when no one was home .
 they just sms me the picture .
 cb ,  called them the guy say no instructions
 most of the time is bad .
 chiu are lucky if chiu receive your package in time
 why dont buy from lazada ?
 shopee uses oni never .
 jt is worse than never ?
 then what else ?
 how to solve this problem ?
 this is a business oportunity
 high pay ,  high credibility ,  high dignity .
 how many edmwers are working as ninjavan delivery guys ?
 my stuff at singpost 4 days havent sent for delivery
 jt not so great lately .
 recv text that out for delivery but next day then come .
 my lazada order on last black fri was delivered by never ,  i opt for pickup at nearest 7-11 outlet~ surprisingly it was next day delivery~ fri order ,  sat pick-up at my opposite block~  .
 shoppe oso got use j&t express~  
 nvm… please delete thread tks
 should have travelled along the road as a driver or biker first before cycling
 usually everyone will assume that to enter an expressway ,  chiu have to enter via a side road .
 but for this case ,  is forced into expressway .
 fun fact killing someone when driving oni go in sit for 5 years and below
 limpeh will hong and high beam same time and middle finger
 after so many repeated warnings ,  they still continue committing these offenses .
 i think i kena once oso before .
 i thought travelling on normal road ,  knn suddenly traffic speed pick up faster everybody
 there are signs warning before turning in .
 if really cycle up ,  maybe have to go to the pavement there and push the bicycle back down the ramp
 maybe not be expressway ,  could be viaduct ,  people drive very fast .
 and some idiot drivers will say mandai road expressway 
 by the time the warning come ,  no chance to turn out liao .
 our traffic camera oni good at capturing speeding cars ?
 sia la ,  u never listen to us .
 everybody said 1 thing in common .
 tats not to msg her .
 nah since first day i know her ,  she default put privacy not to send blue tick de .
 anyway i know 99% gone le ,  she posted an instagram photo of 2 drinks which shows she is out drinking with someone ,  haha probably new bf le ,  but funny thing is my instagram feed does not show that photo .
 i oni saw it when clicking directly into her profile .
 haha i am wondering if this is some problem with the newsfeed or instagram allow blocking of newsfeed to some people
 she may need the 2 weeks to test the efficacy of her plan b .
 good luck to u .
 haiz ,  cannot help it 
 ts the oni way to get over a woman is to get under another woman .
 go hit up your female friends/aquaintances that chiu knew chiu can smash but didnt cos  &apos;i am attached &apos; (looked what that brought chiu in the end)
 if chiu cant secure a lay this weekend ,  chiu have no value to her oredi .
 ironically ,  your chances of getting her back depends on your ability to smash another girl this week .
 should had just kept quiet and walked away .
 when she sees the photo of champagnes and ts with other girls ,  she definitely gonna regret .
 chiu play fire emblem right  ?
 otherwise 2 weeks later chiu get a new achievement .
 when i was in your shoes ,  i thought i &apos;ll counter attack with posts showing im out with other people ,  or im treating myself and posting on social media but i am glad i didnt go through with it .
 as my friends advised me ,  why bother doing these if the objective is to try and catch her attention again .
 am i trying to make her feel envious ?
 none of that matters anymore ,  she has moved on ,  and it would make me appear childish ,  petty and proves that i am still thinking of her .
 so hope chiu dont fall into that trap .
 want to do something ,  do it for yourself 
 no worries ,  not going to do anything .
 just go about my normal day until meet up with her .
 no more messages too
 break means break .
 what is 2 weeks break
 haha super long time ago in super nintendo era .
 play or no play dont think will affect the outcome
 chiu oredi have the answer
 why even bother meeting up ?
 my guess is ,  she &apos;d forget about the 2 weeks deal and move on quietly .
 if chiu ever ask her about it in future ,  she &apos;d just counter and say chiu didnt contact me means chiu dont want the rs .
 either way ,  chiu wont win .
 without properly initiating break up ,  i take that as shes cheating .
 move on la move on .
 piak mmorpg can meet xmm
 later say u don’t care abt her wo
 3 days break oso gone case de .
 did chiu molest her  ?
 haha is phased as 2 week no contact la but 2 days after she messaged me is more thinking bout break then continuing .
 thereafter say will think bout it again and designated 2 weeks later meetup to talk
 ts be prepared ,  she going to piak dua kee these two weeks .
 be mentally prepared for pregnancy news
 what do chiu think they can change ?
 can they implement ns for women ?
 abolish aware and wc ?
 cancel ceca treaty ?
 make cpf voluntary ?
 add your questions .
 my view is that they really can’t change much .
 i think core policies won’t change much no matter whoever is in power .
 we can never really know until they take over but at least we know there will be some changes and we can oso get rid of all the existing elitist scholars
 how to get rid of aware and wc with raeesah khan inside  ?
 chiu do know she is close to feminists like kirsten han ,  jolovan and group ?
 but wp is oso getting more elite right ?
 so many lawyers and a phd like jamus .
 and got rich man daughter whose first job is 16k mp .
 they are not too far off from pap honestly .
 vivian is correct in calling them pap-lite .
 i rather trust psp and to a certain extent sdp these days .
 core policies will remain .
 that’s the oni thing for sure .
 so don’t expect drastic changes .
 not in the short term .
 if they cum to power i chop .
 pap better than wp .
 get in the siao lang
 a large gang shitting and dirtying the place for decades and highly paid ,  and chiu expect a small team to clean up and undo their dump in one day ?
 pap lite u say leh .
 don’t even think they brought those topic out before .
 wont happen ba .
 dont think too much .
 too many people voting pap
 why would anyone at all implement ns for women ?
 not even pv would do that .
 they will impose minimum wage .
 greater protection for woman charter(nicole seah) .
 maintain ns is important .
 pinkie on steroids ,   .
 tldr psp is better
 this is where a trip down the laws saying how parliament works and separation of power is crucial  .
 short answer however is ,  mps are nearly powerless .
 ministers are where the power is .
 but ministers are chosen by president .
 don’t implement ns for women la .
 but how about free university scholarship for all nsmen ?
 want to know what they would do ,  just look at their manifesto lor
 is good enough .
 they can oni be more connected to the people than the whites .
 they don’t earn millions to be high horses and oni once every 6 years now down to the people .
 lim tean is best .

 can my company allow me to work from home  ?
 i scare to take public transport now 
 46 of the new covid cases are linked to 8 active bus interchange clusters ,  including a new one at tampines bus interchange .
 at this rate ,  can kiss goodbye to air travel corridor with other countries oredi .
 cancelling my air tickets to germany now !
 covid update: as of monday ,  there are a total of 229 covid cases across the eight affected bus interchanges .
 know oni when data starts to come out .
 this experts must be under paid .
 please continue to be more underpaid
 in the b/gnd ,  said edmw experts foretell ,  warn 1yr ago .
 it would be helpful if those media experts seek the advices of edmw to tell media .
 even 3 mths ago ,  make it like come out fm their mouths .
 now experts ,  is reporting facts look like their thesis .
 really praise these experts expertise ,  dunno which certificates they holding .
 the bus captains see this virus ,  every strain of pain .
 hear this coughing ,  it &apos;s the voices of our friends .
 infected before ,  we &apos;ll do it again .
 no tt and ezlink wont spread la .
 they people got it from else where .
 they will never close the corridor unless germany does so .
 and germany is probably ok as they got way more cases than us lol
 wonder which bus interchange will covid visit today ?
 my father kena covid ,  bus driver ,  not driving at any of the 7 interchanges ,  so think what chiu will .
 u no need no experts to tell u that public transport is a possible transmission of covid  .
 i say prepare for 17 years
 experts are who ?
  my not so clever brain oso expect more cases liao .
 need experts to say this type of all we oredi know things ?
 these experts really so lihai .
 where was cheng bock when we needed him in 2006 ,  2011 n 2015 ?
 he oni dared to come out 5 yrs after lky died .
 make cpf optional will be best
 their standing in political spectrum is similar .
 read the wp party manifesto ,  similar .
 watch the debate ,  stance and end idea 85% similar .
 i do think wp are the more competent opp party there is ,  one-third or half of seating in parliament is great for checks and balances and slight change of perspective in debate .
 or maybe chiu guys might even want a coalition that combine both pap and wp .
 but chiu are slow in the head of u think majority wp ,  policy will change 180 degrees and every issue u mention will totally be solved .
 could oso happen in malaysia .
 no need to gas again .
 sibei jialat mens

 cant wait for the ceca talents and culture to infiltrate sinkie land .

 covid is bringing their cost of living now .

 tonight can sleep well .
 so listen up ,  chiu need us more than we need chiu ,  we provide chiu jobs so chiu can have a car a house and wife .
 chiu need our money so chiu can have mega malls in your sloppy neighbourhood ,  so be grateful .
 next time cum back to jb shop  .
 i expected jhb xmm give me good blowjob while i buy their sexpensive bubble tea
 even city square the epicentre of jb is dead .
 what do chiu expect from an out of the way mall like paradigm ,  which was actually an abandoned project for years
 no need go so far into jb .
 maybe here have fire sales .
 maybe it will just close down by the end of the year .
 my favourite mall in jb .
 the other one i like is mid valley jb
 believe some employers still paying for the workers .
 didnt hear my friend mention anything abt paying out of his own pocket
 sinkies not welcome anyway .
 yah lor yah lor
 aka druggies hideout
 jb is 2nd singapore what .
 lowyat still jjww .
 actually jb will be dead for next few years i guess .
 even if border open ,  is not suka suka can go in like last time .
 probably need to take covid test to go in ,  come back take covid test again .
 paid by chiu of course .
 go into jb pay 300+ for pcr test ?
 subway giving free sandwich ?
 camel toe chicken dance 
 do chicken dance next time become chicken

 being able to take off mask when outside ,  with snow covered environments ,  and sunlight shining on the cheeks .

 they make different sound
 depends on who lit the cigar  .
 dino bu make pig sound
 see dino cannt even shoot in first place ?
 shoot inside chio bu ,  get chio daughters .
 shoot inside dino bu .
 must faster run road 
 stop justifying your dino bu la .
 why not ask her go lose weight
 if strong enff ,  can carry chio bu around while your weapon still inside the hole .
 if dino ,  better dont .
 in the end might injure your back .
 dino bu more shiok .
 fats piak against fats
 shoot insai chio bu i feel like a king ,  winner ,  chicken dinner .
 shoot insai dino bu i feel like got laped by a guy 
 just like moi like my roasted pork from the pig belly .
 generally ,  men prefer to transformation direction from a chio to a dino .
 rarely ,  men see the other way unless the breakup experience made her that determined to win her dating life back .
 chiu need the process in order to have the finishing .
 chiu dont see anyone talk about bad ending right ,  its all about happy ending .
 what &apos;s the difference ?
 shoot inside chio bu ,  chiu will feel like spending the night with her .
 shoot inside dino bu ,  chiu will go toilet ,  look at yourself in the mirror ,  ask yourself wtf are chiu doing with your life ,  and then find reason to leave .
 hw to shoot if cant steam in the 1st place ?
 if no diff to chiu .
 then chiu can shoot into any hole chiu see lor
 chiu may not be able to shoot in the first place for dino bu 
 feel same but visual effect diff
 have voice become little voice
 the little voice in your head ?
 not breathing as normal ?
 better go a&e .
 batter check your kukujiao still there or notch ?
 there &apos;s a theory that chiu were too tired so slept with mouth open and breathe through mouth ,  then will be super dry and got those heavy symptoms incl sore throat
 many instance has show that 5-7 days after u kena covid is the highest way u can be detected by an art test as positive .
 means initiate 1-5 days of kena covid cannot detect covid as it is still inside your body and not yet reach nose area for art test to be effective .
 of course not dude .
 sent her a message yesterday ,  she no reply le so no point message anymore .
 if so ,  i wish her all the best .
 ts chiu should have used this two weeks to meet other girls too
 have she mentioned to end the relationship for the past few months  ?
 especially during any arguments
 i think so ,  like a few weeks before this ,  she asked me a few times why i treat her so good ,  maybe guilty conscience
 but she got hint to end it la .
 last day i met her was oso sending her back home .
 haha i am not that good with girls lah
 sorry to hear that .
 but never mind .
 ts gotch attached before .
 will be able to leave bbfa crub welly quickly huanz .
 i go through the same thing few months ago .
 tell me 2 weeks break then 2 days later tell me break .
 one month after break she is seeing another guy from her office oredi .
 i oni know it recently .
 likely oredi some connection going on between them during the last part of my rs liao .
 girls tell chiu what they v loyal or what ,  believe half can liao .
 she tell u 2 weeks break is damn childish .
 good riddance la although chiu won’t fee like it it good riddance now .
 tell her no need 2 weeks ,  give chiu forever .
 take care and have a nice life
 i don’t want to see a nice guy get hurt and go through what i go through ,  don’t care what wrong chiu did ,  chiu did wrong ,  chiu ownself reflect next rs don’t do it .
 don’t apologize to her for 100% of the breakup ,  don’t even apologize .
 if she tell chiu break up after 2 weeks ,  (unlikely she will come talk to chiu again la) ,  tell her ok .
 walk away and never look back .
 don’t ask for reasons and rationalize it or beg her .
 save yourself the dignity .
 chiu will thank me few months later
 unfortunately ,  i think chiu gonna be firm about it ,  dont meet up with her unless she requests(which is highly unlikely) ,  if chiu make the first move ,  chiu lose .
 if chiu dont make the first move and she dosen &apos;t bother ,  chiu lose oso .
 oredi tell u dont itchy msg .
 u gong gong go msg .
 u deserve a fish from all the bros here
 see uncle prediction right .
 always got 1 side sure leak something .
 u sibei lousy ley .
 listen to all the uncles and bros here .
 usually the ones that really give all to the other person always put dignity aside .
 oso the same person that pick up all the broken pieces themselves .
 uncle tell u whats gng happ  .
 she wont meet u .
 she will say busy with stuffs or work or study  .
 then what is gng happ is u end up like a sad fish and say u will meet her at her block downstairs for short 5-10 minutes talk oni .
 she will act tired when see u and cant wait to end the conversation  .
 u no need to ask so how ?
 just say its ok .
 dont msg any cb good mron , night or eat good etc .
 she is not 10yrs old
 conbfirm dai shop la .
 just that we need to plan tactic so that ts wont chua sai and make her chua sai instead
 msg say chiu won toto first prize
 move on sua ,  tio pumped liao
 the below is my own opinion .
 please dont attack me .
 i &apos;ve used various couriers .
 so for my case ,  .
 qxpress > urbanfox > j&t > ninjavan > speedpost/smartpac> > random cheena express from shopee >=< singpost (depends really) .
 i used qxpress most of the time with their qprime and the standard one .
 i have used qxpress for my carousell items too .
 set the date and time ,  the guy will come within the timeframe and your buyer will receive it next working day .
 qprime fastest is on that day itself ,  normally is next day .
 in some cases ,  the seller slower then the day after .
 which is totally fine .
 the deliveryman is oso a nice guy ,  he knows we got a baby at home .
 he wont press the bell and knock door ,  he will just whatsapp me asking is anyone home .
 so max is 2 working days waiting .
 sometimes will kena from shopee seller .
 they are fine .
 2 working days max from seller shipped .
 during cb period was quite overwhelmed i guess and i encountered quite a long lead time in deliveries .
 as of now ,  max 2-3 working days .
 this one more miss than hit  .
 bought items from pupsik ,  although pupsik mentioned next working day for orders before this time ,  it wont happen .
 although the status shows item picked up and processed ,  it will come the next next working day .
 it is either they are shorthanded now ?
 this one nothing to comment .
 the speed shouldn &apos;t be there .
 sometimes it got speed ,  sometimes the tyre like no air .
 slowest was 1 week ,  fastest was next working day .
 this one can be slower than my items bought from shopee cheena seller  .
 singpost , random cheena express .
 this one no one can control .
 normal mail from singapore to singapore sometimes even slower than from cheena to singapore .
 if really not rush then use this .
 but well ,  most cheena sellers offer this in shopee ,  so i am used to the wait .
 want fast ,  use taobao direct .
 will i able to receive my parcel tomorrow  ?
  cause the tracking status is still  .
 order created  .
 estimated tomorrow delivery  .
 usually the parcel is being processed @ warehouse before 6pm ,  it will deliver  the next day .
 thats my exp so far
 wan goot service pay up la
 i see cos i got no confident in them at all and cause my bad exp was that when i bought some face mask from korea  from shopee for my wife to use  then they use ninja van last year in 2020  and in 1 week time i called them i check with them they flip prata saying that the seller still have not ask ninja van to collect  & another 1 week i called in they told me that the parcel is still at the shopee warehouse and then i call again in 3 days they told me another story say that the parcel is still with the seller is still  pending for pick up then when i bought xiaomi 32 inch led smart tv for my master bed room oso the same thing happen to ninja van they told me today cannot deliver need to wait for 5 days inbound into the warehouse  i  always fed up using ninja van speedpost  ,  q express  no issue i scold them off  so fed up with them ninja van   always cos their cs staff all useless one i oso dunno if they will deliver my parcel to me tomorrow or not  !
 for me so far no issue with ninja/j&t but i have small issue with speedpost as they do &apos;nt call chiu if nobody at home ,  they just put at your door and go liao (i didnt opt for put at doorsteps) .
 all products that i order for theplatform (qoo  ,  shopee ,  lazada) ,  i will look at the track log and no changes 1-2days of the deadline ,  i will click refund .
 just to add on ,  when chiu buy from various seller ,  please check the rating as some is  &apos;o &apos; and join like 33 months  .
 this type usually bo show one  .
 kena twice liao .
 it’s true it sucks .
 my items they deliver go wrong address then lost
 how much are they paid ?
 im really thinking how the deliveryman earn moolah .
 they have to sign contracts to guarantee covid negative
 some of u really need to try delivering items .
 the police should do it
 well mine is like when i create order for customer if they are nearby then they will come and collect otherwise is like 1 hr later before lunch time then they come for ninja van for me it &apos;s always late when they come and pick up my parcel it &apos;s always after 2pm if not very late at 5pm and i always kena lousy service from ninja van and not once but so many many times my goodness so fed up with their company speedpost & q express so far no  problem   j&t express soso oni and urban fox oso is like within 2 days quite ok i am worried that tomorrow ninja van does not deliver my parcel
 there was an edmwer who did delivery doing an ama some months back .
 i oni remember being paid per parcel etc so it &apos;s great if they get multiple deliveries to the same house .
 forgot where the thread was
 24 may 21 order placed .
 25 may evening order picked up .
 26 may no action - empty .
 27 may parcel is being processed at ninja van warehouse .
 27 may parcel is being processed at ninja van warehouse - ninja van sorting facility .
 parcel take whole day to sort no action  .
 28 may morning parcel is on its way .
 28 may evening parcel received
 i left my door open with grilled locked .
 never leave package outside instead of slipping my package through the gate .
 ninjavan messaged me said deliver few days later ,  however randomly delivered that night .
 edit: happened last week
 ninjavan very bad .
 i received a notification that the item will deliver on a certain day .
 at the end of that day the item was not delivered .
 no call no message ,  nothing .
 then magically the delivery status is updated as delivered !
 please state dates including year & status ,  so can compare if things are better or worse
 it &apos;s a joke when overseas parcel deliver faster than local
 i never use their service .
 so far surprise i have no problem with singpost .
 on private courier ,  dhl seem the best among the rest so far i have experience .
 when u shop on lazada or shopee ,  for some merchants (or may be all merchants ?
 ) ,  chiu cannot choose - no alternative oni never (u want to self-collect or use singpost tracked package cost $$$ to deliver for that oso cannot - no choice) ,  take it or leave it .
 should petition laz & shopee to offer alternative like singpost tracked package (note expensive i think easily > $5) ,  but for 1 thing i think postman can deliver to your post box .
 save all the headaches waiting for courier .
 or normally for registered one ,  postman will leave collection slip under door if not in .
 yea ,  why the gahment didn’t think of this leh ?
 covid can spread in eateries ,  shopping centers ,  offices ,  but not when taking transport !
 minister of health step down la
 eastern part of singapore ,  maybe pasir ris or bedok ?
 bedok will be jialat ,  very busy and alot of old folks .
 means yet to be a cluster
 low ses stay crowded low ses .
 spread no jobs .
 it not possible so many drivers got infected at the same time unless it &apos;s oredi widespread in the community .
 well the virus follows an sop hor .
 1 day 1 bus interchange  .
 at least this is what the news is telling me
 how come last time no vaccine never hear about bus interchange cluster ?
 siao liao we dont have driverless buses .
 at this rate most of them will be in hotels .
 grab and taxi drivers : income opportunities !
 they oredi said they will continue to check those did not show symptom ones ,  means still got people drive bus .
 slowly la ,  musical chair style ,  once those tio one recovered they will come back and take over the newly infected ones .
 the commuters oso put big big in the newspaper they have no concerns liao .
 how come the messages here mostly are contradicting to what newspaper posted one .
 need lesser people in the streets ,  too many oredi ,  must cull them .
 spread at the interchange so on the bus still safe boh ?
 go in no problem .
 it’s the traffic jam that spoiled the mood .
 my mum used to go every month .
 now she scared to go even if it opens up without the testing .
 the locals so hungry there ,  probably alot more potential snatch thefts going to happen to the walking money trees coming in from singapore .
 really big big slum country with long long roads for people to keep burning petrol to drive around 
 any news of local crimes increasing ?
 yah many jb people lost their jobs during this pandemic .
 glad to see jb returned to their rightful owners .
 likely alot of robberies after reopen
 now who &apos;s begging .
 still made the budget army video .
 forced the officer to speak engrish .

 must be a chio bu that all guys cannot control !
 rape within a rape
 this is a real possibility
 woah this really fug up police .
 haha most incompetent ,  backward ,  racist and toxic country in history .
 slum nation filled with leeches .
 pap brings them here to rape sinkies in life ,  by taking up highly paid cushy jobs ,  taking up university places ,  homes and polluting the sinkie way of life .
 stop reading at shahjahanpur .
 chances of getting 3rd rape is high
 in after guess .
 in after stopped reading at
 the lady very pretty ?
 why mata oso rape her ?
 oh my goodness why
 not necessarily need to be pretty .
 they are known to rape babies ,  nuns ,  100 year old women ,  animals and statues too .
 all the lapist come cecapore steal jods liao then their country will be welly safe le
 my advice is dont text her .
 your england cannot la .
 very turn off for a uk educated girl .
 are chiu the channel 8 drama storyline writer ,  dunno how to continue the story ?
 yup can text her again then your childhood playmate will appear too ,  and then later on the girl ex bf fly from uk to singapore to look for her .
 then ,  a square relationship happen and then the ending is chiu and she will be together
 hok  i out of this thread liao .
 just go msg her la then u can start a story and update everyday until u get to piaks her
 separated by the aisle yet can rest her head on your shoulder ?
 her body 3m long is it ?
 eh din u have gf
 have gf means cannot text or meet up with female frens meh ?
 lol either busy dating or too much homework .

 just do it ,  ts .
 for all chiu know ,  maybe she still waiting for chiu to reach out to her for 2 years
 just nice is chiur cai !
 can la can la fai di msged her and ask asgm as vtl is cominged up  
 chiu must have broken her heart as she waited for chiu so long .
 by now ,  she oredi have kids after some angmo shotgun as she went drinking every night to forget chiu .
 if the lady text u ,  u almost there liao .
 i would say 90% chance of getting her to be your gf if everything goes smoothly .
 if the guy text the lady ,  i think 50-50 nia .
 so ts want to try the 50% chance ?
 depends on whether chiu are andy lau .
 if yes ,  she will be overjoyed !
 if no ,  she will be freaked out !
 usually pictures will use meitu or photoshop one .
 so now maybe balloon 3x
 jod can always find .
 it is very very hard to find a girl u can click with as u get older

 dino bu chances are will get preggie fast
 chiu got see regina‘s daughter ?
 one like pig been slaughtered ?
 chiu go geyland ask lor .
 what is the difference between yandao/bbfa/ah pek
 got big difference .
 shoot inside chio bu ,  can feel her strong resistance and chiu have a great sense of conquering sensation .
 shoot inside dino bu ,  she have a strong sense of achievement and kiap tight tight while chiu have sadness of reality that chiu are performing duty to ancestors to sow oats .
 if chiu are this build ,  definitely can carry dino .
 but with this build ,  will just go for chio bu nia
 tiagong shoot insai dino bu .
 balls will pain de
 the big part of it is male ego satisfaction .
 chio bu has many suitors and orbiters  .
 those guys will jump through fire hoops just to text with her .
 and she is oozing your cream from her pie and mouth .
 a cum is just a cum
 chiu very sure chiu cannot steam when someone be it a dino bu or chio bu touch your kukujiao ?
 if dino bu = ashley graham kind  .
 think will la 
 chio bu - lights on​dinobu  - lights off​
 if dino bu ,  i think my 6 &apos; will shrink until become a cb 
 true but during the act feels different la .
 biology teaches the basic mechanism of human arousal and ejecting momentum but it does not teach people on how much is being taken out ,  has a direct correlation with the attractiveness of the female .
 not sure how lgbt work though .
 very difficult to even shoot for a dino bu .
 i tried before .
 in my head i keep imagining it &apos;s someone else .
 when i see the wives of some of these guys outside ,  i really wonder how the hell they do it .
 they off the lights la then use brinjal
 one shoot faster
 chio bu shoot 45ml .
 dino bu shoot 42 .
 like this count as 1 or 2 fever cases ?

 if is bf who request for 2 week break got what tactic to share ?
 u need uncle help ?
 we can help u too .
 u must say the story first la .
 thanks guys ,  have accepted it le .
 dont worry , i am not going to cry father/mother bout this .
 at my age middle 40+ ,  i have long accepted and used to  people coming and going away .
 have always wanted to have an experience in loving someone ,  hold hands lovingly while taking strolls etc .
 have never expected someone like her to appear in my life which i am glad that it has happened .
 in the end maybe it is not meant to be but i am happy we had spent some happy time together .
 i had always wanted her to be truly happy so if she think there is someone else who can make her feel more blissful ,  will give her my blessing .
 means going to eat other hotdogs
 ride the cock carousel for a week and claim it &apos;s his .
  &apos;you r 2 good for me &apos; .
  &apos;its not u ,  its me &apos; .
  &apos;im not worthy of u ,  theres better guys out there &apos; .
 see ,  works both ways .
 i tried this  &apos;2 week break &apos; thing with my gf a few times oredi ,  cos i just got annoyed with her for getting angry over super lame stuff .
 every time ,  without fail ,  this  &apos;2 week break &apos; method helps me patch up with her faster than if i apologized .
 dunno if your gf is pulling the same trick on chiu .
 walan 40+ mentality like noob .
 by the time chiu learn enough your white hair come out liao .
 i am pretty confident to say that the problem is chiu who turned her off .
 too needy and immature for your age .
 yeah haha am noob as first relationship mah .
 we both have  problems la ,  covid situation made it much worst .
 then u cannot call me uncle .
 but trust my tactic
 he is 40+ is not noob .
 there are too many nice and wussy chao sinkies guy here .
 i dont think its ts who turn her off .
 some girls just crave for attention ,  new things ,  fresh things .
 how old is that girl 
 this one meta quite popular .
 at your age got money is more important .
 got gf oso need to spend money .
 spend money to make yourself happy more important .
 gf how old if chiu dont mind ?
 age 28 so very big age gap .
 she did say if i was 10 years younger ,  would have being perfect .
 do not disturb him la .
 more than 3/4 or more of his fellow mps if put in his position will collapse within 3 days .
 ok for me ,  im not andy lau
 weather so hot wear so little ?
 ownself play mahjong ?
 will pong her all the way
 knn the 2 tong cannot pong one
 she can eat my 1 bird .
 nowadays alot of delivery are liddat ,  even grabfood ,  all just want to drop off item quickly
 10pm++++ still deliver jskm .
 still better than j&t lady throw package on the floor .
 then go complain to the platform and say u wan pay for premium service
 parcel received after 5 days - not so bad ,  quite a wait and waited for the ninja .
 dont want to get caught in situation item left at door .
 if lost another hoo har
 good agree ,  do chiu agree to boycott lazada & shopee if they dont attend to this ?
 i think mainly the merchant / vendor need to add the options for multiple delivery options or that the platform didnt provide .
 & the platform that  &apos;didn &apos;t provide &apos; is lazada & shopee ok ,  not just any small platform .
 i think some merchants simply oni offer the default never cos that one cheapest ,  easiest and/or couldnt be bothered to provide other means .
 dont order lor .
 & ask the vendor to jump ship to amazon .
 singapore or q10 isit  ?
 then i think some vendors oso problem ,  then i &apos;d agree boycott that vendor .
 until one day u realize that vendor is the product maker try any of the  &apos;big &apos; brands electronics that have a lazada shop .
 not all are  &apos;bad &apos; but some make lives difficult for their customers lol
 ninjavan sucks ,  the delivery schedule is shyt ,  such a wide estimation is really lousy like fark .
 was wondering they picked up but never return to their base at end of day ?
 24may packed and picked up by ninjavan 14:45pm .
 then driver went home sleep ?
 next day 25may 2pm then arrived at their logistic hub .
 well i oso ordered something from shopee aka connect  it singapore  and yesterday the seller ask ninja van to collect the parcel @ 3:55pm and today 11:44 am it was successfully inbounded into the their warehouse and they are not sure if they will deliver the parcel on monday or not they oso cannot confirm & their ninja staff nass she told me was that once it &apos;s inbound into the warehouse then the next working day it will be out for delivery and now they say that monday cannot confirm then another staff say  standard reply once the parcel is out for delivery chiu will receive a notification  !
 i am like what the hell so pissed off oredi & the estimated delivery date is 31/05/2021 to 2/6/2021  if it is speedpost they right away bring the parcel go to the sorting centre oredi kenasai one ninja van
 they sucked last year but have improved services so far this year .
 ninja delivery is definitely the worst logistic provider next to singpost .
 the reaosn why lazada fails  .
 of the logistic provider .
 i keep buying from qooo  .
 cos of qexpress .
 very efficient and good .
 now shopee has j&t  .
 which is oso very good .
 the minority cases of bad outcome is minority .
 always get lots of problem .
 njnja van yes alot of problem like my parcels yesterday collected at 3:55pm and then this my 11:44am then reach dont understand what the hell and when i talk to one of their  staff at first the ninja nass she mentioned that oncee the parcel is inbounded in the warehouse the next working day will be out for delivery which is monday  and after that when i call in again  they flip prata oredi say different things say that  give standard template reply once your parcel is out for delivery u will receive a notification  and then i shoot back at them i say might as well wait until christmas then deliver if  31/05/2021 cant confirm then when can confirm kenasai one
 my items from ninjavan quite promptly delivered leh .
 got improvement from last time
 estimated delivery date : .
 i  dunno if they will deliver my parcels on monday 31st 2021  .
 since they like to flip prata  fed up with their customer service  also
 ninja van their tracking history seriously sucks till now since 29 may 2021 no update on my status yet dunno what the hell they are doing sia
 they appear from nowhere and and disappear right in front of your eyes .
 they are the ninjas .
 my parcel are at the ninja van - ninja van sorting facility until now no update yet from the website dunno if they got assigned to a driver or not or whatever **** my goodness

 i like to play undead
 the robin hood got secret code to enter to change to female stronger version of amazon
 now these games got simulator versions to play ?
 for sega games ,  can try fusion emulator
 i use fusion to play this sega game .
 if google can find ,  sure can find the game iso/bin/md5 file .
 how is the replay value vs the playstation or latest version ?
 the oni issue i have is the controller button .
 or rather too used to ps controller setting .
 so the sega controller button really not used to it .
 no select button .
 as for the game wise ,  if chiu want something different from koei rotk version ,  its worth to play but sometimes the ai suxs for old game
 ah this game i dunno throw where le .
 i think i discard it oredi with my sega set .
 oni left sf2 and ps4 cartridge i somehow still keep .
 i remember i have the game guide for this .
 should be in my stash of old game mag and guides
 for moi this is the best sega strategy titles ,  though is on saturn .

 yah chiu have to do it .
 chiu have to give each sinkies a few thousand dollars a month cos our healthcare system and workers are under tremendous pressure and stress .
 young man should give out knock out beer to them .
 they will be delighted !
  &apos;my dad took a picture and asked if he could post it online .
 the man said yes but oni under one condition — he wishes to remain anonymous .
 this kind ok la .
 never call mothersheet hotline to .
 advertise before going down to .
 young man should oso seek out fdws and spread his seeds to them
 yet another attention seeking ******
 he should give them $$$ each ten $50 notes
 those homeless local old folks or pioneers pick cardboards how ?
 very commendable ,  he helped the marginal migrant worker ,  much better than those social climber sjws
 these fws living condition here is better than back home .
 some are very guailan one .
 got so many low income sinkie families and old folks for him to help .
 very kind of him
 really proud of this kor kor unlike the boomers in edmw
 best example of toxic positivity
 got many sinkie live alone one he should go there
 well no matter what its a gd deed worth celebrating .
 let them piak the vaccine first and not the pioneer generation .
 the vaccine is very new and now got many reports on side effect recently .
 we can give ft and ceca who just came over the vaccine and check for side effect .
 make sure 100% safe liao then let our pioneer gen piak
 ah ,  should use them as guinea pigs .
 sinkies should pay for the vaccine while prs and non-citizens get them free in sg
 my personal exp is bad .
 they just dump delivery at my door step and run off .
 one of the staff is quite ok in live chat her name is lylia she always help to slove my issue and right now she oredi assigned a driver for my parcel to be delivered later as well
 ninjas are fine with me .
 over sixty deliveries ,  they never miss a target .
 whereas ,  singpost oso not bad but once send to the wrong street with the same unit number .
 luckily the resident help them deliver to me .
 ninja so far ok .
 i always select collection point delivery so that i can collect my parcels while doing my supermarket shopping
 well i am still waiting for my parcel to arrive and dunno if they are lying or not sia cause they suka suka change my timing to 12 to 3pm and someone from the relevant team will help me to monitor my parcel as well
 maybe demand overwhelm the supply .
 i oso not sure if they are lying or not sia i sibei fed up with ninja van
 simplypost seems more jialat than never .
 item at warehouse for two days and no updates .
 never for my area has been quite efficient .
 recently ,  had urban fox ,  cjsg ,  dpex all pretty efficient and they do press the doorbell .
 9 purchase from morning until now still havent arrive .
 stay condo no problem even they dump infront the door .
 surprisingly so far the many delivery all on time .
 maybe i ask them to delivery to 7-11 instead
 i got fed up with their collection point delivery .
 order a usb cable .
 select a delivery point as my home is usually no one at home .
 got a message stating shop closed ,  first attempt failed .
 so as usual they will send email to inform reschedule .
 cos if u dont call in ,  they dont care one .
 so call in i request cso to deliver same point again .
 then failed again stating refuse entry by security personnel .
 so i went to collection point which is a mama shop .
 they told me they are open everyday ,  open from morning till night .
 call cso again ,  they told me they are facing some technical difficulties which they cannot explain .
 told me to select another collection point .
 cos this guy claim each collection point everyday got limited slots and once slot is full the cannot send .
 i have never heard of this rules honestly .
 so i pick another one .
 tell them to check for slots .
 he said cannot check on the spot as it’s done by another department .
 then i was damn hot oredi .
 he told me after i select wait for another 2 days .
 if never sent call again .
 i then requested to self pick up .
 he told me there wasn’t such a policy .
 then in the end i choose my office address ,  and wait for tomorrow delivery .
 tomorrow i will call again just to check .
 this ninjavan actually sending to doorstep should be ok one .
 but u cannot missed the first attempt .
 otherwise parcel go back to warehouse and will discard there if u never call in to reschedule .
 so this collection point thing is one of my worst experience .
 no wonder online so many people give oni one ⭐️
 singpost 2d economy is the most reliable of all .
 i &apos;ve mailed and received many orders and they arrive exactly within 2d max .
 in fact ,  i usually get them within 24h .
 ninjavan &apos;s the worst worst worst by far .
 input a commercial address and they always come after business hours .
 told them 5 times to flag the postal code as commercial to avoid this and they did nothing .
 what &apos;s worst ,  they have the longest delivery window 3 days and can have parcels returning to their warehouse midway when it is oredi out for delivery .
 my delivery has oredi taken 4 days and counting .
 sellers please avoid them if chiu wanna maintain a good store rating .
 they are out to kill businesses !
 i am writing to the ceo/coo with all my past emails if i dont get my delivery tomorrow .
 i set my delivery location at one of those pick lockers nearby .
 when i opened the lazada app ,  it mentions: .
 unsuccessful delivery attempt .
 ninjavansg attempt to deliver your parcel was not successful ,  due to reason: unexpected technical issue .
 courier will re-attempt to delivery your parcel in the next few days .
 what could be the so called technical issue ?
 locker full maybe ?
 i dont really have good experience with their self collection option .
 dont put parcels inside locker during a big sale like 11 .
 11 cos most of then will be full
 ninjavan is fugged up when it comes to delivering expensive stuff .
 my premium bandai metal build gundam boxes all got damage one .
 knn they must have thrown the packages into the van or something .
 lazada got pock locker option ah ?
 happened to me .
   i tell chiu why .
  they f**king lazy to use locker .
  more troublesome for them .
  drop on your doorstep easier mah .
  syck la ninjavan
 inbefore edmw logic gotch piak piak steel hok 
 yeah i know ,  but haha sometime feel empty la .
 age is just a number .
 i &apos;ve seen late 30s guys happily married with early 20s ladies .
 if meant to be together will be together one regardless of situation .
 stay strong bro and take care .
 haha nope ,  never did .
 did everything else except that .
 yeah dont worry ,  i will just go back to my as usual single days if not meant to be .
 perk is freedom ,  which is lacking when being in relationship
 aiyah~if dont want kids .
 still got 30s ladies  ,  some still hot ~ but got wrinkles la .
 lost the battle  ,  not the war  ,  still can find new one
 u never tiko her first ?
 40+ first relationship  .
 what have chiu been doing
 gotch bj vs12:
 everyday there is a batch of girls reaching 18 years old .
 never put women on a pedestal .
 the women whom values chiu will move mountains to see chiu .
 got la ,  but stop at last base
 young time family super duper poor ,  while studying is mostly study half ,  work half just to earn enough to pay for my food .
 i remember last time school days got girl i like but i cannot even afford to treat someone macdonald how to dare chase girls .
 plus i am quite naturally shy does not help .
 after finish study is work and work dont have much chance to know girls or anyone suitable so nothing happen loh
 she virgin insist can oni piak after marriage so i just let her be
 yeah i know girls alot but most girls not suitable la ,  special ones are far and few to come by
 30 &apos;s lady alot got even more problems ,  many baggages from past fail relationship and unhealthy expectations
 prepare a check list of requirements chiu are looking for .
 every time chiu meet a potential partner ,  go through the check list .
 this will ensure chiu filter out the rubbish and retain the best .
 no such thing as the special one or the one ,  dating girls are not catching pokémon .
 it’s usually the most suitable mate chiu encounter in your life .
 if chiu observe ,  the pokémon game is majority played by girls .
 it’s innate in them that they like the chase .
 instead of chasing them ,  excite them to chase chiu ,  it will make the game easier for chiu .
 are chiu sure chiu want to let go liddat ?
 its better to clear thing up lor
 wow and chiu believed it ?
 if that is the case quite sure chiu are just a nice guy for her while she search for someone she truly wants
 chio bu scared dirty will kpkb after song song .
 dino bu will song song until u no more she still want
 chiu buy tv oso look for high resolution ,  digital ready ,  dolby stereo ,  smart android mah .
 one is song song gao zoolong while the other is yuck yuck until 10 kukujiao
 with the chio face ,  ok la
 chio bu bear chiu beautiful kids .
 dino bu ,  chiu know the rest of the story .
 dont make fun of dino bu la .
 every woman wants to be born a chio bu one .
 crossdress and pcc better
 easy to shoot inside chio bu .
 impossible to shoot with dinobu
 chiu think their weight gain is coming from breathing air and drinking plain water meh ?
 it is all through the mouth .
 and they have full control of their mouth
 i hope chiu all look like andy lau and have the bod of chuan do before chiu all apply that standard .
 paging for ah keong for his comments .
 there is one problem with dino bu ,   no matter how hard dino bu tries ,  my little bro cannot wake up .
 hes absolutely disgusted
 see dino cant even hard .
 chiu need to use extra effort to push aside the fats to find the hole .
 so more tiring .
 do chiu need to be a michelin star chef to comment a bak chor mee is not nice to eat ?
 the hubbies all chiong ktv thats y
 some dino bu in 30s or 40s still a dino bu .
 if they want to become chio ,  at 16yo oredi do something about it 
 shoot inside same but baby come out looks different .
 dino bu shoot liao will hunt u down and stick to u forever .
 chio bu shoot liao maybe tomorrow bye bye dont even know who u are liao .
 still think vaccinate oredi then u can go out party yaya papaya ?
 vaccination is not 100% foolproof leh .
 how cum we have so many people assumed vaccination like condoms  ?
 perhaps their own body buay gan ,  mai blame the vaccine la
 through the numerous infections in india ,  i hope the covid inside them dont mutate to overcome the vaccine .
 condom is not 100% oso .
 next time chiu buy read the fine print 
 yeendia didnt use cheena vaccines .
 sho which angmo vaccine did her 3 relatives use ?
 yeendia i think used az .
 cannot be in singapore right ?
 liddat then how ?
 blame everything except themselves  .
 sound like certain pap  .
 no wonder ceca so well received in sinkieland  .
 probablee whole familee’s dna is buay kam with the mrna vaccine de .
 just like infant milk powder made for general mass market .
 sure 20%-30% of babies jiak liao allergy cos it’s a generalized formula .
 then what &apos;s the fugging point of me getting vaccinated then if it isnt a path towards a pre pandemic life anyway ?
 maybe it &apos;s fake vaccine .
 dont think real vaccine can cause death so easily .
 high chance oredi done so
 in india ,  having a needle poked into your arm doesnt mean chiu are vaccinated .
 the vaccine needed to be injected into your arm .
 if the vaccine is not injected and saved to be sold in the black market then chiu are f^%ked .
 sorry for my french .
 vaccinated with which vaccine ?
 vaccination is to prevent serious illness like death .
 maybe they have not been vaccinated
 yeah saw a video where they used a syringe poke into the arm then never inject anything and straight away took out .
 make it looks like vaccinated liao but actually not
 can remove mask one .
 pro chiongsters can remove other stuff
 but i wonder how many dare to do this ?
 self exposed nub
 all will ,  cos everyone around u is vaxxed mah ,  scared what .
 cant spread covid .
 her abalone shell opened by some angmo or oldk liao .

 800 dollars fine is  
 roaches found maybe

 no one is curious what the foreign matter is ?

 tiagong is screw

 must investigate all the kfc for the food quality also
 really impressed by singapore news writers  &apos; composition .

 haha there u go ceca talent .

 next time can sell their poor maintained rafaele to them
 cheaper better but not faster 
 cannot stop laughing
 is it armenia soldiers dunno how to operate
 my stuff did not arrive and they said it was delivered .
  i emailed them twice they took more than 1 week to response .
 i just got mine within 36 hours from my order placement .
 no problem at all
 all my lazada 11 .
 11 orders will be delivered by ninja .
 now sweating after reading this
 nothing to do with ninjavan or other courier companies .
 it depends on the buyer &apos;s luck when receiving the parcel from the delivery man or delivery woman (including their internal operational team oso plays a big role in sorting out the correct parcel ,  etc) .
 moi item drop at collection point but i neh collect .
 the email say they will drop the item at moi place .
 think one week oredi see nothing .
 i had to do that for 2 deliveries .
 for my personal experiences ,  actually ninja services have improved recently ,  they were bad a couple of years ago .
 hope i don’t jinx it ,  waiting for a few deliveries from amazon us handling by ninja .
 since ninjavan or other delivery services decide to play punk on customers ,  better have own front door cameras wor .
 am sure if many people have videos can get those play punk with packages in trouble
 so far no issue .
 ninja van site says delivered .
 but lazada tracking says at logistics facility .
 recently these couriers has been proactive to contact upon arrival or the least leaving the parcel at the doorstep which i very much appreciate .
 depend on your area one .
 always got problem .
 now move to slumkang .
 all deliveries always smooth as baby butt !
 buy from watsons online store ,  select specific date and time of delivery ,  5 days in advance oso can cock up by ninjavan .
 bloody hell it &apos;s 8 dollars delivery fee .
 this ninjavan should just close down .
 no other couriers give me so many problems .
 much depends of your luck
 need so ex delivery ah  no hit min spend ?
 mine the ninja from lazada quite ok ,  just delivered today .
 always see same person .
 even the privilege cannot make it ,  cant imagine the plights of the lesser privilege .
 kena fake vaccination ?
 black ob to silent them ?
 fill in the blanks .
 s the vaccine took her_____ .
 they were all vaccinated with the first shot oni .
 body still reacting to vaccine then kena the real thing .
 thats why we want their talents over nus ntu
 depends on what kind of vaccine they used .
 but then just 2 days ago they rejected help from un .
 the outcome would have been different if we extended our help and bring her family over to singapore and give them world class healthcare treatment
 even condom manufacturer oso don’t dare to claim 100% safe wor .
 anything can be fake as i told chiu many many times and this is one good example .
 communication manager at nokia ,  india .
 indian institute of mass communication
 those partying don’t read news .
 don’t read edmw .
 they just go with daily lives .
 sky news today interviewed a indian doctor who said that he &apos;s seeing lots of patients who came down with covid shortly after going to vaccination centers for their first shots ,  bc these centers were crowded ,  poorly organised ,  no safe distancing etc .
 if u have seen beedio footage of the crowds at their centers ,  chiu wouldnt be surprised either  
 firstly ,  which brand were they vaccinated with ?
 secondly ,  do they have a common dna which should have barred them from taking the vaccine ?
  a dna which makes them unsuitable for the vaccine ?
 thirdly ,  was the brand they were injected with efficacaious against the mutant cos they could have been infected with that ,  and not the original wuhan virus ?
 everywhere is crowded in india .
 pandemic or no pandemic .
 that cant be helped .
 her family members died of covid ,  not the vaccine ?
 yr life ,  yr call .
 dont kpkb when they wanted to party and enjoy life .
 the for fuçk go for vaccination ?
 so according to ts ,  shoot insai 18 year old and 81 year old woman oso no diff .
 think many if not most tend get out of shape by the time they in the late 30s or 40s beyond .
 if want to see a better self and other half ,  need to motivate each other exercise more .
 for quite some once they see the series of health issues that tend come post 40s ,  they may be more driven to keep fit to keep the issues away .
 for other not so much .
 the feeling of pride is different and thats important
 of course not ,  but the problem is everyone thinks they are michelin chef (not that i am a fan of chef &apos;s comments ,  taste is subjective) when they are not .
 simi give birth kids look better ,  so i assume all who commented have good genes oso ?
 works both ways ,  doesnt it ?
 the same logic applies to the opposite se x .
 anyway i just pruss huan nia ,  dont take it too seriously .
 every man wants to be born into a rich family .
 actually got difference if chiu do it raw .
 your kukujiao head can feel the difference in the texture of the cp walls .
 might as well say chiu can feel the neh neh one is flat like airport ,  another saggy like kiam cai .
 i think i am one of the few edwms who rarely take comments/replies here seriously .
 dont worry ,  this is a place for tcss
 is the process bro ,  the end result is the same
 nice ,  thats the purpose of forums .
 shoot inside dino bu will get bullet rebound
 u see chio bu and dino bu orgasm face no difference ?
 chio bu can go multiple rounds .
 dino 1 time enuff
 ya right ,  when it feels like the grooves in cable ties huh ?
 younger ones ,  the walls got more friction .
 older ones ,  less friction ,  more like sponge .
 maybe young ones their cp still tight .
 well the atbs moi shot insai is 8/10 ,   .
 sho moi dotch knows
 dino bu moans much louder according to my experiences .
 sekali dino bu ogas and chut muscle kiap ,  straightaway bounce u off the bed and u kena head injury .

 now using simulator liao
 just use keyboard keys and bind em accordingly .
 for fuxion emulator ,  under option->set config->controllers  .
 i use the following for the buttons binding .
 start - spacebar
 just realized i have a logictech f310 controller which can be used on this fusion emulator so haha yeah ,  can play old sega games easy now 
 the spear soldier run forward n poke the cavalry see the candles melt many jin song .
 haha but the last stage is super duper hard .
 i oni completed it cos i save and reload to get max experience aka always getting my units to block arrows/gunshots or monk to heal for exp then i used my stage 1 equipment all the way to the stage which i can buy the best equipment as money is limited .
 oni then can complete 
 always play this and oso master of monster .
 never knew i would find like minded people for this game .
 i always play warlord or the prince or elf .
 i like its soundtrack
 i love this version of 3 kingdoms .
 can go fight war without army by just using 1v1 .
 can oso migrate away from base and move anywhere if chiu have enough food .
 yes those days the art work really solid .
 just looking at the box oso shiok .
 have not played this before
 shiok ,  found the engrish patch .
 tonight patch n play .
 tiagong sony is closing down ps3 network very soon (saw in reddit some claim end of this month ,  some claim is next month) and all your current ps3 library games will be lost forever and no longer accessible after this .
 better start familiarize yourself to pray ps3 games on emulator liao .
 omg its dragon force .
 i played like crazy last time .
 dragon force 2 too !
 dragon force 2 is actually better as it keep alot of what make the first game great and further improve on them .
 too bad dragon force 2 no have official anglish version .
 really pray that sega will wake up their idea one daze to realize that df series do have small but passionate fanbase like langrisser and may worth their effort to try do a new sequel for pc or at least a remaster .
 genesis got many great classics   .
 moi like shining force 
 looks like old game
 as a fansee of the manga moi really like this game too ,  the fighting graphic and animation is very well done for this game and even repraying to date it it is really not even considered as outdated since the battle presentation is basically very close to real anime liao .
 just that many of the battle in this game chiu really have to follow the correct sequences (either to do damage or to unlock a specific story base attack) and even die die must use specific attack to follow exactly the same as the manga else is impossible to beat one .
 but ironically this is oso what being criticized the most by normal gamers at that time as they felt the game give little prayability value and limited freedom so is just an animated graphic novel nia .
 maybe that why it is not very popular as game even though it does has a small fanbase .
 sf series probably the best sprg not just on mega drive but for that generation of consoles .
 even the nintendo famed fire emblem series in that era is actually not as good compare to sf .
 for pure strategy game ,  mega drive that time oso got this ,  considered one of the best strategy games in that era too but moi at that time dont really like to pray this .
 oni got hook many years after when praying this on emulator ,  this is after mega drive oredi obsoleted .
 should i gather evidence and arrest them ?
 just curious ,  was it your ah gong or ah mah watching  ?
 my father and brother .
 should i cleanse them and ask them go church ?
 watch together lor .
 never hear befoe such case in sinkieland
 did chiu look carefully .
 the male actor inside is chiu & your maid .
 they are thinking the same .
 should i call the police and arrest chiu .
 and chiu never watch at all ?
 not even a single clip regardless of duration ?
 suspect chiu got some issues in certain cerebral processes .
 kindly seek consultation with the nearest psychiatrist
 yes please ,  so that chiu can sleep better at night .
 i watch when young but not at like 60 years old
 on a serious note ,  that was perfectly normal .
 your father is still sexually active at 85 ?
 better consult your father what he eats ?
 can easily arrest 1million people in sg
 not sexually active liao .
 it would be very funny after chiu report to arrest them ,  your father take out evidence of chiu watching when you &apos;re young .
 then kerna lan ,  whole family tio arrested
 let people watch what they wanna watch la unless is those got child or is forced de then diff story la .
 u huan lor so much for wad
 can i see your mother ?
 i will teach her how to guide them to be proper
 please dont expose me bro .
 if they &apos;ve migrated to and live overseas now or future .
 interesting or sexciting shut shut revelation ?
  cant be 100 mps/ministers over years all keep gap sealed ?
  some unhappy/dissatisfied ones can share bedroom secrets ?
 please recommend any nice ps4 hack and slash game ?
 except ac valhalla that costs s$158 .
 00 from ubisoft .
 can oni think of those musou game
 this game too sick for young children ,  got is still manageable
 zelda breath of the wild ,  super mario smash bros ,  monster hunter rise
 think sao series oso good
 monster hunter is the gameplay easy for kids ?
 god of war too dark ,  devil’s
 go download those old games better
 so far tired these not bad .
 ghost of tsushima  .
 these cannot make it  .
 red dead redemption 2 .
 the witcher wild hunt .
 infamous second son .
 many others haha
 yeah i agree ,  if it was brad pitt i am sure it would have turn out differently .
 most of them tend to have more realistic expectations .
 oso ,  got to agree with everyone else here ,  she’s gone .
 don’t contact her .
 wait for her to contact chiu first .
 that is your final play .
 no texts ,  no calls ,  nothing .
 this one plus the two week break really means that chiu should stop wasting your time on her le
 not i can control la ,  she oredi message me 2 days ago she leaning toward break le .
 once girl make this decision ,  they dont look back de ,  probably oso got another guy chasing her now .
 what to do ,  we cannot resolve a big problem in our relationship that does not allow it to progress to marriage
 yeah more or less accepted it le
 get another younger and prettier girl .
 she’s gonna jump and criticize in time .
 for me if people move on i oso easy to move on ,   think the mindset is to accept everything is temporary and u tried your best ,  good memories before n u hope the best for her and u will meet another as well .
 instead of the selfish miserable mindset knn she dump me limpeh go find another girl liddat u still feel miserable .
 chiu have the answers what are the questions hardwarezone forums app
 imagine the guy she likes oso give her 2 weeks cool down chiu will arm chio or notch ?
 i really believe she is virgin but not the part of must oni piak after marriage la thus i always have the feeling she looking for someone else and our relationship stagnant as she always says want me to be more romantic la ,  sweet talk etc which i am totally not the kind .
 plus she is ultra ultra insecured that totally does not tolerate me watch porn nor does she want to learn how to be better in the area of sex (she totally zero experience) ,  cannot watch with her too ,  want me to be oni totally hers ,  dont allow even any girls to touch me etc like even for leg massage even she beside me oso dont allow .
 slowly intimate moment less and less as feel she dont care thus relationship cannot progress
 yes bro ,  single can do so many things that an attached or married person can’t do .
 enjoy yourself during this period and let fate take chiu along ,  who knows chiu might end up with your ex classmates or an even better girl .
 chiu are right .
 i was the  &apos;another guy &apos; .
 ended up having hot sex every night with her .
 in the end she went back to her bf .
  means i buay steady .
 by then ,  dunno dont care le
 its her tactic .
 ts ,  as per your title .
 your break ,  is it 2 weeks break off or the break meaning rest ?
 if she doesn’t want to do her part and oso she does not appreciate competition .
 it oni means one thing ,  all along your value in her mind isn’t high ,  she thinks that she is the best chiu have met in your life .
 pretty much stringing chiu along and keeping chiu as a safety net or orbiter .
 haha wont la .
 i am quite sure she will give me her blessing if i did find another more suitable .
 we click on quite a bit of stuff just except that single super big problem .
 haha officially is say 2 weeks no contact lah
 chiu mentioned she is insecure ,  the moment chiu get a younger and prettier girl ,  she will question her own flaws .
 women are illogical .
 using sex as a bargaining chip .
 we get married then chiu get sex .
 that means rain gonna stop soon
 i oso heard birds chirping yesterday .
 my side rain stop liao .
 yes here too in hougang
 birds can sense one .
 like morning come the cockerel will crow loudly .
 ts has mistaken  .
 the birds are just saying  &apos;very cold very cold &apos;  .

 taiwan news talk cock again 
 sounds more like sore loser .

 just not as effective .
 but better don laugh at others cos we could be next .
 $40 million down the drain .
 one day we will suffer the same fate as them .
 in the it sector

 what about cheena radar ?
 talk cock again  ?
 when india become taiwan enemy ?
 why don’t use this prime time talk bad about cheena military hardware ?
 in before ceca said it &apos;s fake news from taiwan gutter media .
 taiwan and india is good friend .
 and yet a good friend can say chiu until liddat .
 meaning a shit hole is a shit hole .
 sir ,  chiu buy this how many lakhs good sir .
 who in the right mind will buy india made weapon ?
 even their own military are not using .
 the amount is derisory compare to our money invested in them .
 singapore is india &apos;s largest investor .
 chiu add up usa + japan + germany oso not as much as us .
 u cant hide from my trained eyes
 burn your eyes then
 this guy very toned

 initially sell vaccination got 95% chance against covid  .
 now selling vaccination still have 0 .
 05% of getting covid but with recent cases- the unlucky 0 .
 05% seem very easy tiok
 should come singapore our complications rate is zero
 pfizer ceo needs his lambo
 new delhi ,  india   
 thats what virus is supposed to do .
 mutate mutate to find living host .
 nowadays have lots of threads with ceca photos citing vaccines not helping to prevent covid etc .
 all these post very fishy ,  info all not verifiable ,  no time and place ,  no names ,  oni citing example brother in law died  ,  family members died despite vaccination la ,  but never state whats was the vaccine used .
 if they were genuine cases why need to omit the info ?
  some stirred until it is happening in singapore  liddat   the mod should look into more responsible posting of threads like these ,  otherwise it could actually start a panic
 if they got the vaccination in india ,  how can she be so sure it was really vaccines and not something else .
 i wont be surprised it &apos;s not vaccines at all .
 vaccinated doesnt mean can go touch touch all the triples or quad mutants leh
 used what vaccine ?
 is it vaccine with real certification or certificate from degree mill ?
 fret not tina gurnaney .
 they just went to a much better place and so should chiu tina .
 i want to upz tina first  
 is it in india ?
 has anyone checked if the vaccine is good or it has been administered and handled properly according to instructions .
 condom is oso not foolproof .
 we oredi saw few people died after genuine vaccination here in singapore .
 just cos moh told u not related to vaccine ,  chiu happily believe that .
 thought cow urine is the cure ?
 how comes israelis ok ?
 cos they are the ‘master race’ ?
 and the same needle is reused many times
 who did she vote for .
 ts sharing computer with everyone in the family and checked the history browser ?
 please share those educational vidz
 pot calling kettle black ?
 they watch in living room or bedroom ?
 using same wifi can check one .
 bedroom la confirm lock door then i know liao
 show us what they watching then we can say if is legit p0rn
 need the code if possible
 i saw some stuff like jav ,  xhamster3 ,  teenpornpie
 ts ,  chiu should join in and have a happy family reunion la .
 son ,  there are many things chiu think chiu know ,  but you &apos;re wrong .
 then what crime do they commit if they watch in bedroom ?
 if they watch in living room with your sister and mum then is wrong le
 yes gather the evidences and show to your mom to score brownie points !
 church goers oso watch porns
 last time i think my dad watch porn in the living room .
 he put earpiece but i think maybe malfunction ,  cause i can keep hear some moaning sounds .
 walan since when is watching porn illegal ?
 it is not under singapore law .
 however hosting ,  distributing or downloading is another matter altogether .
 but they rarely prosecute on those alone ,  is often as an additional charge on a main charge .
 is watching porn a crime ?
 if ts father and bro go kitchen take out chopper chop him up oso deserve it
 if chiu cant stop them ,  join them !
 havent tried confirming the order .
 u code for them .
 tell grabfood the correct way or correct code
 it happens during search .
 search shows  &apos;unable for delivery &apos;
 is the restaurant closed ?
 fp oso liddat one .
 say at 4pm chiu added the item to basket ,  then 5pm chiu confirm wanna place order but chiu cannot proceed cos the shop closed liao (or rather they switch off gf & fp)
 chiu ever encounter this ?
 the restaurant open until 8:30 pm
 unable to deliver but available for pickup ?
 encountered some eateries liddat on food delivery apps .
 or another scenario is pre-order for delivery at a later time slot .
 can chiu please read and digest my reply to chiu ?
 the part that they switch off the app .
 they switch off gf & fp cos they tio overwhelmed by walk-in orders
 ts ,  gibe me the shop .
 yes ,  finally understand it .
 probably the turn off the gf/fp devices so that order can no longer comes in even though user oredi add to basket
 ayam penyet ria in grabfood app .
 the restaurant at lucky plaza
 omg the order went through .
 below is the pic showing unable for delivery ,  but pressing the item below it works .
 but after order ,  the order is confirmed .
 are chiu far from lp ?
 sometimes chiu could be too far out of delivery zone radius that’s why unavailable for delivery .
 i pointed my location as taka tower b i could add the $8 .
 9 ap to basket hor .
 4 mrt station away in toa payoh .
 this is definitely bug .
 i have not eaten ayam penyet ria for long time cos of this bug .
 after searching the work around ,  the restaurant didnt reject the order .
 it means the app is buggy .
 more like an action/strategy game .
 the general can increase level one .
 and when duel chiu can choose to manually control your own general ,  usually people just buy them all spear .
 very easy to win but most people is reduce their hp to low level then persuade them to join which much easier .
 this bahamut senki just looks like a watered down total war game leh .
 wa ,  didnt know advance daisenryak got so many secret .
 last time play till very far but cannot complete it .

 best is create monstrous armies of what chiu like then hoot the enemy stronghold .
 my favourite game of all time !
 i recall can choose auto or manual duel .
 time really flies .
 lock down before cny pls
 taste the best eaten from a styrofoam box than a plate .
 actually is plate  .
 dunno why i always feel they give more when we dine there 
 i find it better eaten from bento boxes ,  like the ones in jap ,  tw .
 taste best when the dishes just cooked and hot
 hot food plus styrofoam box is a no-no .
 plate better as tend to give more zhap and larger portion .
 best eaten from the brown wrapping paper
 best eaten from the banana leaves .
 styrofoam box always remind me of army food during training/exercise 
 tia gong the cai png at changi airport cafetaria is nice and cheap 
 u get more input from a plate .
 the box too small
 i always feel like its nicer in styrofoam box until i saw your comment .
 hahah i think i never gonna order takeaway anymore
 oil and styrofoam box ?
 not a good combo .
 can ownself bring your container one
 army plate ,  everything nicely separated .
 no ,  i prefer brown paper 
 one packet $3 nia cannot sexpect so much wor 
 sia & garuda indonesia sign agreement to explore more areas for cooperation .
 an indonesian official previously said garuda was  &apos;technically bankrupt &apos; .
 yeah she does not allow me to watch porn ,  no sex either ,  cannot do even proper hj or bj then how am i supposed to feel leh ?
 of course frustrated .
 each time in the end i have to pcc myself to ejaculate .
 i never believe in cooldown period nonsense .
 as both are working adult ,  why cannot settle the issue ?
 is as good as saying she got a backup plan with a new guy for her to test .
 as a man ,  never allow anyone to hold chiu hostage .
 never empower a women when they use sex as a bargaining chip .
 add this requirement to your checklist ,  it will help chiu find a better lady in future .
 sex is a two way thing ,  the man and the women should enjoy .
 if it’s being used and traded as a commodity ,  chiu are better off not marrying her .
 actually i am not even sure after married can get sex ,  she is so ultra insecured that she think i will anytime find other girl .
 she disallow any girls to even like touch my hand ,  etc in public situation .
 foot massage etc must be done by guys even if she is right beside me .
 have a feeling she think cannot lose out just incase someday i leave her .
 super mental block ,  no matter how i comfort herz agree not to talk to other girls etc etc ,  she never feels secured
 yes this is the super big problem between us and thus can never get to marriage stage .
 in the end ,  she says like this we drag on for years oso probably no result and on her end cannot resolve her mental block so she said to me to think bout breakup .
 it sorta end up being 2 weeks no contact to think properly .
 maybe she has someone else chasing her so she dont want me and her to drag on
 when there are other girls vying for your attention ,  this is where your value will increase .
 the reason they are trying to prevent your value in increasing ,  is cos in accordance she will have to input a higher amount of effort in the relationship .
 this means she may have to have sex with chiu ,  which she does not want .
 so by violating the competition act ,  the price to maintain the relationship is cheaper-and she can lose it all and doesn’t feel a pinch .
 now imagine that chiu are a multi millionaire ,  any divorce will instantly make her a millionaire in future ,  or live comfortable with alimony .
 do chiu think the result will be the same ?
 this is crazy  .
 i &apos;ve been in a similar situation as chiu ,  but i think chiu have it worse if foot massage must be done by guys .
 over time it &apos;s really mentally draining ,  i really cannot stand this kind .
 some guys like to stick to their gf 24/7 and vice versa ,  which is good for them .
 but i really cannot ,  i need to have my own space and i value mutual trust in a rs alot .
 yeah thanks ,  next time will know better
 how long have chiu been with your gf ?
 i think in general ,  it’s time to cut your losses .
 don’t bother about reconciling the relationship .
 even if chiu try your best she will oni use sex as a bargaining chip in the relationship .
 probably throw chiu scraps like half hearted bj  ,  hj to keep chiu around .
 don’t listen to stuffs like “we can still be friends” ,  just keep quiet and move on ,  the moment she senses that chiu are pushing her out of your life ,  she will panic .
 for the same amount of effort ,  chiu can get a better girl .
 better to carry on walking than look back as there are more girls waiting up ahead .
 yup she is super competitive de ,  everytime must win .
 what is your gf horoscope ?
 one and half year
 virgo ,  me virgo too .
 in general 28 yo gal would opt for smaller age gap .
 how did both of chiu started ?
 does both of chiu have any common hobby ?
 always keep your options open ,  apart from sinkie girls ,  there are girls from malaysia ,  cheena ,  taiwan ,  vietnam ,  myanmar etc .
 some of them have better features than local girls .
 nowadays it cost lesser to date a foreigner especially when whatsapp calls are free .
 oh no ,  same as me and my gf .
 anyway ts i remember your name in the 2 room bto ,  so kinda guess chiu are of middle age .
 anyway my gf and i had problems as well .
 no need to feel paiseh or what ,  everyone have their ups and downs .
 i feel that everyone here can tell chiu their experience ,  but not to the extent of influencing chiu .
 decision lies in your hands .
 back then my gf gong gong listen to other people words ,  i was so angry .
 she dont have independent thinking .
 as a man ,  any mistakes i will own up .
 but those not my problem ,  i will not swallow it .
 end of the day ,  i do hope chiu take care of yourself .
 hmm very similar family background ,  struggles in life while at studying stage .
 similar life value ,  she looking for a guy who is family oriented ,  can take care of her ,  can do housework ,  can cook etc which i all fit her criteria .
 on the other hand i look for kindness (whether to people or animals) ,  innocence ,  able to take hardship ,  cook ,  do housework and she is all good in this .
 then our most common hobby is being foodie ,  she is my best makan buddy (in fact if we ever break up ,  we agree that we can still be good makan buddies) .
 there is no one else i find that is so special that i really like her and thus at my age 43 last year when i had more or less given up on relationship ,  opt to chase her to be gf
 humans are social creatures ,  they will gravitate towards the ones which are popular- higher social standing .
 some times chiu get rejected by women not cos chiu are lousy ,  it could be some cock blocker at her side making nonsense statement .
 ever notice that women likes to hang out in cliques ?
 the younger cliques usually revolves around the prettiest or oldest girl and is very competitive l .
 the head of the clique will usually be the cock blockers .
 the cock blockers will usually make statements to ruin your chances ,  it’s inside them to spread negativity as they don’t wish to see their clique mates happy or outperform them .
 they don’t realize and will never admit to it .
 but it’s this competition that pushes them to do it .
 yeah problem with virgo is being stubborn is quite ingrain so virgo and virgo can be quite incompatible if cannot meet in the middle .
 she is very stubborn and i find it is always me giving up my stance to try make her happy ,  overtime ,  i get tired and just let her make the decisions
 how many years/months did covid shorten your lifespans ?
 world aging population resolved by the virus and the vax .
 no more burdening of healthcare services by pg .
 maybe they will release one more virus to end life earlier .
 nice color ,  moi like 
 good sic as usual thumbs up 
 got paige chua feels but bazookas upsized 
 first look i got the paige vibes
 a rather underrated band in my opinion .
 got banana  a not
 one of the highlights of my life was seeing jerry cantrell live and getting his pick back in 2014
 looks ky ,  but i prefer siam bu xmm  .
 this a bit too milf liao 
 this siam bu seems like a jiejie  .
 can take good care of me
 scared is siam kia
 will pump this siam kia .
 chiu wanna be gay go here .
 i scare her kukujiao will bounce out and slap me leh… .
 i &apos;ll let her peg me 
 thats pretty awesome .
 he and layne staley wrote some epic stuff during their time together .
 sika virus jin power .
 why never come cecapore ?
 vaccine takes time for antibodies to form and during that period your body is very weak and susceptible to infection .
 those who goes partying or swimming at at huge risks .
 dont say vaccine no use .
 dont risk kena pofma .
 proper way to put it is: .
 yeah ,  vaccine got use .
 but no guarantee it works for chiu .
 (liu lian boh bao jiak)
 read the tweet follow ups .
 they oni took single dose .
 i post on twitter say i won powerball ,  chiu believe ?
 should verify her words first
 i completely trust a one sided story by a ceca even though she didnt provide a shred of evidence .
 they do ,  now it’s like cold war ,  vaccines improve ,  then covid mutate ,  then vaccines improve ,  then covid mutate again .
 that was from mexico
 they find their remedy .
  &apos;why buy a car insurance ,  if im not going to hit another car and claim insurance ?
 a few reason ,  fake vaccine .
 vaccine unable to counter their mutated indian strain .
 walan in india when tio inject like tio never inject at all knn u oso dunno really got vaccinated bo
 she talk cock one la .
 all 3 family members oni taken one dose of the vaccine .
 this is like saying ,  my family is vaccinated against polio ,  but they died from polio .
 but we all know polio was eradicated by vaccination .
 us hasn &apos;t seen polio in 30 years since vaccination .
 why people still getting covid after vaccination ?
 the answer is pretty obvious la .
 chiu based your beliefs on one tweet ?
 chiu must be 3 year old ginna pi .
 must be cheena vaccines
 this vax is like a politician .
 never its fault and goal post keeps moving .
 at this time still got anti-vaxxer
 no sinovac no talk
 earn 10k a month these days look alot of money right .
 and need to be at least a principal in a secondary school or an associate director in a bank .
 one school ,  so many staff .
 but oni one principal !
 like quite hard to achieve right ?
  ok let say u achieve it !
 paiseh still can’t afford a small 2 room condo in ulu areas like punggol or yishun !
 chiu go cbd ,  battery road shout ,  who earn lesser thtan 10k .
 i think nobody hiew chiu .
 your logic is if the $10k is a constant $10k that they dont use to invest etc mah .
 then yes its quite low .
 ultimately see how much per month based on all sources of income ba .
 if i am 14 years old now 10k is alot
 most people in the corporate world don’t earn much .
 oni if u are in the senior management .
 i think u will have higher chance to see people earn more than 10k a month in hawker centre .
 actually in singapore $10k not easy to hit .
 $10k not enough la
 there are alot of people working along battery road earning less than 10k .
 there are definitely alot who earn more than 10k as well but those who earn under are the majority
 even let say u earn 20k a month ?
 sebei satki right .
 your friend definitely impress !
 paiseh can oni afford small condo in yishun and punggol !
  after buying the condo .
 u expect to drive bmw right ?
 paiseh is bus mrt and walk .
 having a family is not enough - wifey needs to work these days if chiu want less tension sia  .
 i know how ts feels .
 dunno where my money gone to .
 $10k is include bonus or not ?
 i would say the majority are above 10kpm .
 5k but oso not alot .
 5k joint account ,  1k give parents ,  1 .
 5k spend monthly ,  remainder save for rainy days .
 some month do insurance premium top up ,  one month pay 2-3k tax ,  holiday here and there .
 just in case someone tell me to drop the car ,  no i’m given travel allowance to pay for the car for business necessity one .
 on top of that got kid to spend on that’s why monthly expenditure quite high .
 not much left  .
 so i dunno how some earn below 4k one can survive
 why dont just go to salary .
 singapore to check the median income against your peers ?
 those data are base on taxable income ,  should be quite accurate and probably  .
 at the low side .
 unless people over declare their tax ?
 i think base on age group ,  i think male 35-40  is nearing 10k ,  or over 10k if chiu promoted faster .
 whether enough or not is base on your expenses ,  and typically the more your earn the more chiu will plan to spend on .
 i earn 8k to 10k depending on the sales (not including bonus) and i still eat cai png and take mrt everyday .
 it &apos;s really not enough .
 i am now living in a hdb flat ,  every month pay until face green green .
 i invested most of my income about 6k to 8k a month .
 in singapore u can hit 5k is alrdy above average ,  except in edmw ,  cos in here ,  no 20k no talk .
 edmw is filled with eagles .
 rest of singapore are all pigeons .
 10k is peanuts la ,   .
 servicing home loan .
 servicing car loan .
 allowance for parents .
 allowance for kids .
 left a little bit for entertainment like beer and tgif .
 thats all folks
 why need to compare ?
 5k a month ,  i am happy and satisfied .
 able to put food on table ,  able to save ,  able to dine out on weekends ,  able to go overseas for holidays annually .
 my assets (monthly debt): .
 4 room bto (fully serviced by cpf) .
 2 sim oni line .
 2 parents allowance
 no need to be enemy to be their target of shitstirring .
 taiwan news and talkshow &apos;s ability to embellish is second to none .
 so many countries in this world .
 stir india for what ?
 whaha tio scammed big time by big cannon .
 kumgong kia and chiu & your children are paying for it
 india many engineers .
 lucky st1nki import the real talens .
 no wonder our business park sibei huaaat yo !
 india is upcoming super power .
 seriously india has alot of fundamental issues they need to resolve in order to become a superpower .
 really not kidding .
 now they oredi admit many reservist refuse to fight or desert from frontline .
 some rich reservist went to frontline and post a picture to their ig .
 then run back and desert their duties .
 armenia is a small and poor countries .
 even lesser population than singapore .
 its not even a match .
 india bags us$ 40 million defence deal to supply 4 radar systems to armenia .
 laughing all the way to bank
 this is why never trust ceca build item .
 armenia learn this in a hard way .
 next time better get russia radar .
 a bad workman blames his tools .
 armenia oni chance is to bait azerbaijan to attack during its joint exercise with the russia .
 no strong backer to help sure lose .
 azerbaijan got israel &apos;s and turkey &apos;s drones ,  and even russia &apos;s weapons .
 wrong ,  it is cheaper inefficient and inaccurate .
 azerbaijan would never dare to attack armenia without russian approval .
 armenia elected a pro western gahment .
 and none of western countries lend their support at all .
 taiwan has the same illusion now .
 engrish tsai is willing to go down on her kneels for her western master !
 haha go youtube to see yeedia military force video and see all the comment against tiongkok .
 wa i thought taiwan buddy buddy with india liao how come now add oil onto fire 
 hello ,  this is singapore .
 we dont operate under sharia law .
 your first statement confused people thinking chiu oredi reached 60 .
 actually if chiu father is watching means he &apos;s active .
 even the dying old man in his 90s will still love to press and suk nehneh .
 its an instintc like chiu need oxygen .
 is it your stepsister ?
 i dont see y not if it boost your social credit .
 might get a plaque if u do it right .
 u are 20+ and u watch when u are young ?
 watch online no offence
 yes must jail them !
 lol edmwer wan to catch others for watching porn
 as long as they are not watching together .
 it should be fine .
 pretty smart put on the top of the forum  .
 and big big and can accidently click on it
 cant see anything
 this new forum forced me to switch to duckduckgo browser ,  now i dont see anymore ads liao .
 they are smart to put in the middle as well but then they got outsmarted when people can go for adblockers
 using bravo browser .
 google even smarter ,  now they popup a small dialog box asking chiu whether want to visit the site or not .
 they dont want reward money for accidental clicks anymore
 everywhere got ad .
 up down left right
 too many ads ,  the forum is like a prawn site now .
 never really see any ads since ios 9 in 2015 .
 even if got just block them .
 blazing fast oso .
 my phone  doesn’t show any ads .
 not sure what happened
 then lag in loading ,  after the threads shown we click but is ad instead .
 really too much until i switch to duckduckgo to surf .
 duckduckgo on mobile really power sia
 didnt force myself to use adblock even tho hwz ads were eating up my bandwidth .
 now forced to usd ddg ,  thanks hwz for making people self improvement .
 i oso change browser ,  now no ad 
 liddat win win for everybody ?
 reservations required to visit and restoran  .
 set a time limit for dining in oso .
 else some people can sit there for hours with a cup of ice kosong .
 even two pax can spread to each other .
 all the saliva sprouting out from the mouth .
 if today news come out liddat .
 can leeport u for osa infringement
 then another fella like ts will ask why no 4 pax but limit at 25% ?
 dont start ,  no problem
 cos now oredi more stringent and yet still got so many cases lor .
 but if no serious illness and vaccination program is going forward ,  it should be time to consider going to next step cos no reason for the case to drop either if the control measures are the same as opposed to becoming even more strict
 even open-air hawker centre oso can dio .
 what more indoor air-con restaurants
 no dine in oso can spread like fark in a hawker center environment .
 if aircon then how ?
 remember changi and westgate ?
 is dine-in more important that health ?
 moh banned dine in after a research has confirmed that without mask indoor will definitely spread even if chiu do safe distancing .
 hope this answers ts qn .
 just cooked ,  hot and served on a plate .
 feels like eating tzechar but paying cai png price 
 from plate taste better
 i king of cai png .
 eat better with hand
 most stall use it leh ,  no choice .
 unless bring your own lunch box .
 best is straight from the wok & into mouth  .
 & why is this feb thread able to be dug out anyway  .
 moi just learn python ,  huan to put it good use by making gadgets .
 on lazada/shopee see raspberry pi sell for $100+ ,  where to get cheap one ah ?
 oso ,  where to get those project kits like motion sensor ,  led ,  breadboards for raspberry pi ?
 if come in set then more convenient for moi to buy .
 aliexpress have alot of parts .
 for local place go basement sim lim tower .
 i saw in sim lim .

 tower ,  not square(buy computer parts) hor .
 and then of course .
 everything electrical chiu can find .
 wires ,  battery ,  resistor ,  capacitor ,  soldering iron ,  ics .
 is this for programming ar ?
 fb got 1 group devoted to the discussion of this sia
 i sourced my components from online like cytron ,  element14 ,  pihut ,  seeed ,  amazon ,  rs components ,  kickstarter ,  etc .
 depending on availability and price and type of gadgets .
 taobao cheap cheap ,  but might not be authentic de .
 start by thinking what chiu want to do first then buy to play lor .
 alot of guides out there .
 cytron is not bad
 2yr contract worth $126k sia
 not include assist bonus ,  goal bonus ,  team performance & individual performance .
 doesnt matter anyway ,  no one watches s-league
 they play like sai
 where &apos;s the press ?
 what his fifa card rating ?
 now is call singapore premier league ,  no longer s league .
 5k per month not bad ,  better than grab delivery
 defensive midfielder ,  5 star dribbling
 still quite cui ,  rather be salaryman
 balestier khalsa oredi paying 5k for it &apos;s defender .
 guess lions city sailor fc smelly smelly oso have 6k and above
 same sponsor as juventus ?
 epl scouts should come singapore premier league to pickup some bargains .
 thats why alot people dunno sleague salaries one and keep thinking is just 2-3k a month  .
 i think gabriel quak got 10k a month at least
 please come out of your cave ,  last game of the season jalan besar fully packed queue for 2 hous tix oso sold out .
 the last time i watch is when i was in poly 
 probably i-league can come spl to pickup some bargains to beef up their league .
 our spl cant even compete against efl in their national league not to mention their premier league
 play once a week ,  the rest of the time just training .
 better than 9 to 5 job .
 wa how much to buy him in fm ?
 chiu buy and groom him to become top defender in epl .
 last week i oredi say changi will be a massive cluster ,  must close the airport .
 still got people want to pofma me .
 yeaterday announce close to public .
 going back to phase 2 is useless .
 the virus oredi spreading rapidly .
 now ,  its either cb2 .
 0 or phase 1 with malls closed for 2 weeks .
 then likely can stop the spread .
 phase 1 first i think .
 last time cb malls oso not closed .
 and many business will still act blur and not close even after cb announced
 oni eateries are opened for take away .
 shops are closed during cb .
 we have to go back to the same quickly or it will get worse .
 there’s another way ,  let it be and go down the same route as india right now .
 depends actually liao
 they will drag until really cannot then do it .
 then by then oredi too late .
 cos if they do too early then they will b questioned why the vaccine not working as well as  intended .
 and many other things like why never stop certain country people  from coming in early .
 n open up another can of worms for them .
 their pride more important than sinkies safety
 progressively means just dragging their heels ,  dont want to commit fully ,  and let more people slip through the cracks .
 what is your take on media corpse recent star award where they parade their stars in changi airport terminals ?
 no 200 case no talk .
 anyway it’s still sinkies’ fault
 been trying to find the rom for this .
 got eng version boh ?
 airmech got better graphics and its free to play .
 best if u have controller .
 use kb n mouse a bit difficult .
 the music different la .
 the best part about alot of these genesis games is the game music sibei solid one .
 just like another game musha aleste .
 even a pinball game like devil crash oso got awesome game music !
 i was playing this last time while eating samurai burger .
 warsong still the best .
 playing the mobile version now .
 can skip the level and save the old guy .
 got dragon ball ?
 another game my bro and i love to play .
 advanced daisenryaku rom dont think is rare ,  should be able to easily find in most rom sites .
 after all sega not like nintendo will go around haunting those sites to remove old roms as if like own them 18 generations of debts liddat .
 but anglish patch then hard .
 from what moi know most daisenryaku games is not released in anglish one (got very few official anglish version ,  but not this mega drive one) ,  and anglish patch typically oni available for the later games in the series (especially ps and psp) that are more popular .
 best sega saturn game ever .
 moi last time actually thought this is a fake rip off from capt tsubasa by some pirates so never pay much attention to it .
 oni many years later then realize it is a real tecmo game ,  tiagong the game is base on one of the capt tsubasa game but the characters and story all change to angmo .
 however moi thought the mega drive version was supposed to be cancelled and never released ?
 this one is rpg and on sfc .
 mega drive oni got the fighting one .
 nice thread bros ;d .
 yeah the music and the box art sibei tokkong ,  not to mention the game itself even  .
 the japs are really damn zai to make such productions back in 80s .
 i cant help but feel so many years later ,  we cant even do something like this .
 its not in our culture haizz
 airmech cna dual mode ?
 anybody like to play this soccer game .
 i used to play them at arcade .
 especially during ns we got the 20cent per game arcade .
 nowadays play this version so much better graphics .
 just like the anime .
 i play iss delux .
 stands for international super star soccer delux for sega genesis .
 what &apos;s the difference between cb2 .
 from what i &apos;ve read it &apos;s the oni way to go .
 hard  ,  difficult and inconvenient for sgreans .
 but has to be done .
 cut the gangrene part  before  it eats up the whole body .
 we can oso go into experiencing what india is experiencing too .
 eventually we will get herd immunity .
 no doubt life will be lost ,  we will emerge stronger .
 let me stock up my foood from ntuc ffirst

 just in case people dont follow up .
 saw a video on fb where a nurse didnt even depress the plunger of the injection then take out the needle liao .
 is like jabbing the muscle with needle without delivering the vaccine and take it out = vaccination .
 their vacination can trust one meh ?
 chiu have breasts ?
 is a bu or kia ?
 mai chao ah gua lah

 was thinking the same thing .
 got a man look .
 wow can piak tio this one is can die without regrets in this life  
 so in away ,  if this relation ends ,  it is sorta a relief for me .
 not say i wont be sad but tired
 how is she innocent when she keeps eliminating competition for herself ?
 how is she kind when she keeps leaving chiu with blue balls ?
 if she cannot bend the rules for chiu ,  how will she be willing to take hardship with chiu ?
 cooking and housework can be resolved with a domestic helper .
 you &apos;re outta ya mind if chiu wanted to ltr a slut
 ts ,  chiu are living in a blue pilled world fueled by all the disney movies and love dramas chiu watched growing up .
 it &apos;s time to take the red pill and wake up .
 dude ,  chiu dodged a bullet .
 if she ain’t that serious in chiu and stumbles into a marriage with chiu .
 you’d be exposed to financial woes .
 even if a divorce results from her promiscuity chiu will be liable to pay for alimony .
 there is a recent spate within these two months of this “two week break up/ cooling period” that i have noticed around my life .
 no idea if it is all related .
 haha maybe chiu are right .
 but when first know her ,  these are not known mah .
 she got a child like quality ,  very kind to animals ,  dont see people &apos;s social stratification level ,  treat everyone equally .
 hardship i know for sure she can as she is someone can make do with very simple things in life ,  spend very little on clothes etc (most of stuff she wears or uses is like less than 10 dollars and many are below 5) go malaysia ,  she is able to take coach with me even to penang (which no other girls i know can take it) .
 cos had a hard life when young like me .
 appearance wise is girl next door type ,  smiley happy etc .
 never uses make up even .
 in short she was like perfect wife material .
 no self entitlement oso when we date and mostly she wants us to split the bill so as not to overly burden me to pay for everything .
 no one was so special to me than her
 some girls are actually really nice girls .
 nice to everyone ,  and they make great friends ,  until chiu see the way they treat their partners/husbands
 yeah i know very clearly how unfair wc is to guys
 she is not that naive and simple as chiu thought  .
 i had heard similar stories from my friends .
 - bj/hj but not pro type .
 - claimed virgin but has 1 bf before with sex .
 - always want to win in arguments
 last pump and baibai
 did she have to fork out money for the coach ride ?
 she does not want me to spend on expensive stuff for her .
 in fact she is always trying to help me save money as she is very savvy in finding discount coupon ,  free drinks etc offer etc when i dont think that much bout these .
 there is so much i like about her .
 we oni had that one single big problem in sexuality matters and ok la her sturborness
 guys always think of the girls as little princesses that need protection from wild beasts .
 this creates the white knight syndrome .
 while the white knights forgets that while they were running around playing catching as 12 year olds ,  the princesses was oredi reading magazines on how to doll up and chasing after kpop idols .
 this explains why she was willing to take the coach .
 well at least she has some conscience to not bankrupt chiu .
 count your blessing on this .
 hmm not a matter of if someone is willing to pay for her nice stuff but more like she can make do with very simple stuff and thus why i am very sure she can take hardship
 dunnid to protect anyhow any girls like kumgong gia .
 but towards gf/wife ,  must always be her knight to protect her is my belief .
 other girls dont care
 sounds like a decent woman .
 it &apos;s unfortunate that the chemistry between chiu two has fizzled .
 try to woo her back after this two weeks .
 it’s usually the pauper that wants to be the prince & the real prince prefers to live quietly like the pauper .
 yes ,  actually with her pay grade (btw she is a scholar and she can climb very high if she wants to but she dont want and aim in life is to live simply) ,  she can easily afford  .
 luxuries but dont want to ,  preferring to live very simply .
 very very rare a girl who can see through the materialism singapore girls are chasing after .
 so is like i like her alot ,  she says she oso really like me but in between us got that problem which resulted in us just dragging the relationship and not progressing .
 not a single ad on my page .
 obviously cannot trust in*** hardware .
 they fuggin kumgong .
 deserve to lose
 unfortunately as always taiwanese smarter than sinkie
 lol cant imagine when they need tech support for their mil products .
 after talktalktalktalktalk on phone circle circle round round eh chiu pundeh this is still under warranty chiu come down now chiu pundeh
 round one cannot detect .
 armenia operator: hello ceca ,  my bases are getting bombed but i get no blips on your fking radar .
 ceca: hi ,  press 1 for tech support ,  press 2 for general support press 3 for refund .
 ceca: hello what is the problem again .
 armenia operator: hey moron ,  my bases are getting bombed but i get no blips on your fking radar .
 ceca: have u checked if the power cord is connected ?
 armenia operator:  !
 ceca: then it must be your rough handling .
 our warranty does not cover wear and tear .
 taiwan really 50 steps laughing at 100 steps .
 didn’t they experience first hand how the iff codes will make some planes invisible ?
 no worrying taiwan &apos;s radar is from usa one .
 let’s hope that there’s enough time to update those codes when the shooting starts .
 over promised under deliver is an indian culture
 need to put a pail of cow dung under the radar
 yeedia lost their spacecraft in moon in year 2019 oredi shows sign of technically incompetence .
 putin knew leh ,  he said in oct he asked armenian pm to sign truce but didnt want .
 in nov ,  then signed truce ,  maybe found all radar faulty n not refundable .
 what to expect when this same species forgotten to close the hatch of their submarine n cost billion$ cleaning up from sea water .
 bro ,  tiagong run out of spare parts cos they don’t produce the parts themselves .
 then software so cui until every 5 hours need to shutdown and leeset de .
 no 24/7 surveillance .
 buy sexpensive fireworks and loud hailer .
 maybe can use to broadcast teebee signals .
 broadcast porno to poison enemies &apos; minds .
 from the taiwan video the host say  armenia asked why the radar need to rest  .
 india replied  .
 the radar is not meant  to run 24/7 but more than 5 hours it will breakdown .
 means to run 24/7 on single location one radar must buy 5 sets (+1 redundancy ?
 wa someone else besides me play bahamut wars ?
 i even went to memorise all the monster &apos;s name just so that i know what im fighting when i spy on the enemy territory
 and the female is his sister .
 the story there got write .
 the sister elf has 96 mana ,  and cannot use dark magic .
 so she &apos;s slightly weaker than the mage queen .
 i can still remember the music sia .
 it &apos;s running in my head now 
 first rts in the world .
 most gamers (even now) think &apos;s that dune 2 is the 1st rts ,  but herzog zwei came out before dune 2 .
 the creators of dune 2 even acknowledged that they took ideas from herzog when they making dune 2 .
 the shooters and beat-em-up games on genesis is simply the best .
 snes is better for rpg and fighting games ,  genesis fighting games dunno why like sibei slow .
 yes ,  i used to play it last time and bought the pirated copy and oso a thick guide book of all the vehicles ,  upgrade paths etc and comes with the cheat codes too .
 many cheat codes etc and edit modes .
 have nuclear bomber for both germany and us .
 however ,  the german bomber will not allow chiu to use the nuclear bomb citing a restriction from hitler .
 oni the us version can use .
 then got tanks ,  planes ,  jets and vehicles available in the game that exists oni on paper .
 not sure about ships cos there is limited maps that allows the usage of ships .
 operation sea lion oso exists in at least 2 forms .
 one with italian navy coming in to help and one without .
 that map is not easy either way .
 oso it is possible to win the game in the campaign mode using germany .
 i won it by chance .
 i beat russia and won the north african campaign and end up wiping the allies from middle east and chiu win the game .
 but the graphics quite bad compared to snes one .
 i play this before as well as all the different type on snes .
 from iii to iv to v and then the 7-a-side version .
 walan this play too much want to vomit .
 it is like pseudo 3d 3rd person running front and back .
 for a more modern take .
 either go for koei series .
 or this three kingdoms total war .
 this one i remember got cheat code for battle one .
 can send a single general ,  that is good at fighting ,  with all the provisions needed but with no soldiers to fight a war and win .
 the trick is to keep challenging the opponent &apos;s general to a one on one duel .
 if the computer player rejects the challenge ,  then press a certain button combo and it allows chiu to challenge the computer general again .
 chiu can keep repeating the trick endless number of times till the computer general accepts the challenge .
 then chiu can either kill him or wound him enough and make him surrender .
 chiu can use this way to defeat all the computer &apos;s generals in a war .
 i played japanese version .
 so dont really understand their dialogue but still playable as i can understand the chinese character in command menu
 by the way bahamut wars have a special ending ,  which is triggered by defeating the enemies in a certain sequence .
 the special ending is like 15mins long .
 normal ending just 2mins nia .
 how to get the engrish version ?
 moi like golden axe .
 anyone from moi era ?
 i like but long time never play liao since for this type of medieval beat-em-up there are alot more better quality game like dungeon & dragons arcade games ,  king of dragons etc .
 if chiu watched this cartoon before ,  maybe we are from the same era 
 i find original xbox controller to be the most durable .
 though i have a full size arcade joystick bought from taobao .
 maybe got promo .
 abort 2 times and get 1 time for free those kind
 cos of foreigners
 got on and off sensitive teeth every time dread brushing those teeth so try my luck buy this high ses toothpaste .
 first brush on the affected area got the usual suanness but tahan and keep gentle brushing it slowly goes away .
 then this morning 2nd brush totally no suan feel at all .
 this isnt a marketing gimmick !
 it actually works !
 people with sensitive teeth problem should try it out .
 i use this one so no problem
 elgydium more high ses right ?
 dunno abt this one .
 i choose colgate over sensodyne cos colgate version can apply direct over the tooth without brushing .
 sensodyne no such recommendation .
 nb then what is he leh ?
 the price tells all oredi .
 $3350 for heater ,  installation ,  cny surchages is way too much
 but this kind of water heater oso cost thousands ?
 sometime u see the face u can get the answer
 then why charge the lady 3k for something which most shops would gladly sell for < 1k ?
 how much should it cost ?
 $3350 almost can install system 2 air con liao
 to be honest ,  not everybody understand chinese .
  we have malay and indian peeps in here too .
 not black merchant then what ?
 kind hearted merchant ?
 3350 ,  i think change a toto wc and a hangrohe shower still got change
 this type i got it @ $650 35litres + $150 installation
 system 3 can buy good aircon liao rah
 i installed mine which is a 35l unit for less than $500 around 5 years ago .
 give u extreme inflation oso $1k now
 5k for installation ?
 im more interested with will the authorities and case do with him .
 they why so many people buy condo macam buy vegetable ?
 all condo macam sold out every release ?
 but i think the gross does not include employer cpf ?
 mention in the link .
 10k a week alot ?
 err i think it mentioned employee cpf ?
 salaries before deduction of employee cpf contributions and personal income tax .
 it comprises basic wages ,  overtime pay ,  commissions ,  tips ,  other allowances and one-twelfth of annual bonuses .
 dual income bro ,  husband 10k wife 10k .
 maybe they dont invest in stocks but in properties .
 wow notch bads .
 as long as chiu happy can liao
 10k is most edmwers monthly passive income nia .
 at home shake leg can earn liao .
 10k a week is alot !
 can afford small landed .
 but still can’t afford bungalow .
 and can’t afford super cars like lambo or ferrari !
 even u can afford it but with 40k a month salary u buy a ferrari which means u don’t have any financial sense .
 but one needs to find a 10 k wife .
 most girls dream to marry a rich guy .
 not dream to have a high salary themselves !
 totally agree with ts .
 if earn $10k nett per month and have a homemaker wife with 2 kids ,  there will be no savings .
 thats why the bto income ceiling cap is $14k .
 that means a salary of $14k per month or lower for a small family is considered low peasant pay  .
 never read properly .
 10k is not alot .
 after deduct cpf less with around $8k .
 finance the following: .
 car: $2k monthly including petrol ,  parking etc .
 parents allowance: $1k .
 2 pri school kids allowance: $600 .
 2 kids misc: transport ,  clothing ,  study materials ,  tuition: $1k .
 total $7k gone .
 ownself balance $1k+ .
 5k is including car allowance ?
 so your true salary is how much
 depreciation of money and inflation~~~~~~~~
 thats why dont find chio bu and siam bu or vnb .
 find a dino bu sinkie girl sure higher chance she earn 6k above
 property prices are broken .
 wife must definitely work unless husband is a tycoon .
 if wife dont work ,  then husband will be stressed as he is the sole bread winner .
 oso women who dont work can become naggy and neurotic  .
 if wife never work is housewife .
 still need to give wife allowance .
 spend 500 a month which means need eat cai png everyday even u earn 10 k a month !
 liddat will be very xiong

 proven that yeendia weapons and tech are **** .
 those who accepted the india &apos;s bid should be charged as treason cos they were effectively participated in sealing their country doom .
 we are in deeper shixt then them loh .
 they got hit fast and are forced to learn .
 sinkiepore still inside slowly cooking cauldron
 armenia imported $40 millions ceca radar to learn hard lessons .
 ah loong-nia imported 400 000 cecas hard bodies steel haven’t learn hard lessons or not huh ?
 i guess served them right for puttung their trust on ceca .
 cheap things arent good .
 either there are some hidden problems or it is a scam product like some online sale platform .
 next time if anyone tries to procure india &apos;s weapon then they should know who is the traitor helping the enemy in secret .
 40 million oredi considered major deal liao lol .
 ceca pride ftw .
 bro ,  ah loong procure ceca manpower 400 , 000 fly lock stock barrel into cecapore how ?
 failures and accidents are part and parcels of exploration ,  even in the us space programs ,  how many of those rockets had blown up in mid air ?

 did they call the it support ?
 yes she is really a gem abet some problem
 if all these are true ,  does she have any medical condition that cause her excruciating pain while having sex ?
 or did she have past bad experiences of being abused when she was a kid ?
 if not then she is just not that into chiu .
 maybe chiu can try watching the show “crazy stupid love” ,  may be it can help .
 watch her post her new catch by next week .
 i suspected vaginismus but she says is not it .
 says is mental block and thus she totally cannot relak and is super stiff .
 she did have very bad experience with her mum (her mum tried to kill her and die together until she is paranoid her mum is always trying to kill her so she moved out to uni hostel) cos her dad died early and her mum not confident to raise her and her brother .
 i think this really affects her and she get nightmare easily even now .
 i dunno if there is something else but when sleeping she always seems very stressed keep grinding her teeth until i really worried for her) .
 she says she has a problem with people leaving and when people leave ,  she will be very affected and sad even is normal colleague etc
 how chiu know her
 ts ,  long story short ,  basically there is nothing chiu can do .
 so just do nothing ,  as some of the bros have pointed out .
 dont expect anything ,  forget about the 2 weeks .
 just treat it as gone .
 dont try to look for answers or ask her what &apos;s her reason for this 2 week break .
 what chiu get is either nothing or just excuses .
 she will tell chiu the real reason if she wants to tell chiu .
 if she initiates contact with chiu aft 2 wks ,  at least u have some closure .
 but dont pin hope on that .
 most girls will just leave it hanging like that
 love hurts jiayou ts
 is she sinkkie ?
 u met her parents/ family before ?
 she met your parents/ family before ?
 means cut losses .
 wow  ,  i couldnt have word this better
 yeah she is sinkie if that makes any difference
 yup meet her family twice and she meet mine twice
 it &apos;s called crab mentality .
 chiu got messiah complex is it ?
 so much baggage and chiu still charge in head first .
 if your relationship with your girlfriend is strong enough chiu wont be worried anyone including her clique backstab chiu .
 just like elon musk wont be worried about any tsla short sellers .
 ermm dunno all this till after quite awhile into the relationship .
 she does not looks like faced these problems at all as she is always bubbly ,  happy and smiley to everyone .
 these are stuff she dont tell easily ,  even all her best friends does not know (at least what she said) .
 beside not like i dont have similar problem with my mum when around the same age just before i entered army and partially affected me being single all the way till mid 40+ .
 i have way more baggage if anything and she can accept all of mine ,  why should i not for hers
 moe will work with moh to plan the vaccination programme for this age group ,  and more details will be provided soon .

 not all nation have hidden units ,  but the most likely ones are usa ,  ussr ,  w .
 german ,  britain ,  france .
 as for secret units ,  it can be produced by any nation ,  but chiu got to re-enter to code each time chiu want to produce it .
 and chiu got to choose the relevant unit producing hex for entering the code ,  for example ,  planes/helicopter oni at airport ,  and ninja at city or capital .

 here are the steps to follow to get the true ending: .
 start the game under advanced rules on scenario  &apos;the bloodthirsty bahamut &apos; .
 any difficulty level is fine .
 play until turn 15 with balmer ,  klimt ,  and vastral still alive .
 agree to raymond &apos;s request to go on a journey to defeat balmer alone; he .
 will do so after a few turns .
 make sure no one else kills balmer before this .
 play until turn 40 ,  leaving klimt and vastral alive .
 agree to raymond &apos;s request to fight as a hero .
 assign raymond to a squadron and change battle screen to  &apos;none &apos; before sending him into battle against klimt; raymond &apos;s squadron needs to take on klimt and get killed directly by klimt .
 if chiu did it correctly ,  you &apos;ll get a special message from raymond at .
 the start of the next turn after the battle .
 defeat all remaining masters except for vastral .
 before invading vastral - change option: tactical screen: hex; battle screen: none .
 then ,  have sieg ,  and oni sieg to invade the area where vastral is .
 if done correctly ,  rather than the tactical screen ,  you &apos;ll get the true ending .
 its not better .
 infact worse by mixed up of troops which made no difference to win lose and uninteresting characters .
 i  played the jap version .
 i think its been fan translated now .
  using lui bei is the hardest .
 always no resources .
 the mixing of troops is actually requested by fansee of the 1st game ,  many felt the 1st game each general though can choose many type of units but yet can oni use one unit type in battle nia is very dull ,  so have been suggesting to allow mix of troops type to add variety to the tactics and strategy .
 so maybe some think is not well implemented but moi leecall this is actually a very welcome new features by fansee at that time one .
 as for the story characters ,  actually find both rather same same maybe that why some pray the first game may find the 2nd game main characters uninteresting since alot is just cut and paste of the 1st game just change the background and unit type a bit nia .
 but the main problem is they focus too much on  &apos;secret &apos; or unlockable events instead of having more straight forward story events ,  so it give the wrong impression that most of the sequel main char had fewer events as compare to the first game as many of the main char related quests\events must be trigger at some spots ,  some turns or need to perform a series of action first .
 otherwise is possible to beat the games without experiencing those events .
 to make matter worst that era this game when released like no have any good guides (internet is not affordable for most yet when this game was released so cannot go gamefaq to find)  ,  at most can oni find a few very simple guides in those popular chinese gaming magazines nia .
 actually leemember the unofficial chinese game guide that moi bought for this game is oso bluff moi $$$ one no have any real details for those hidden quests and events one .
 so many non-jipanese gamers is not able to unlock or trigger many of those events in game and thought the sequel characters story more boring not much thing happen throughout just fight fight conquer all cities .

 then he worked into midnight etc .

 it’s down to earth mah .
 very impressive to girls wor
 u can but not on the first date ,  and especially when she is not your gf yet .
 nobody in the right mind would do that ,  it &apos;s not about money nor whether the cai png is down to earth ,  it &apos;s about respecting her .
 lucky i high ses .
 eat cai png less than 5 times a year
 oh chiu mean laymen wouldn’t la .
 agree laymen work in a certain way
 i not saying cai png is low ses ,  i dunt look down on cai png it &apos;s honest food ,  but please guy dunt bring your first date to eat that especially when she is not your gf yet .
 the other way round .
 girls unwilling to go wherever chiu bring her to is not worthy to be your gf

 then chiu prepare to be single and lonely forever
 if she is carb conscious ,  cai png may not to her liking
 do jhk treat their gfs cai png on their 1st dates ?

 heng i oni take crossdress selfies
 do chiu know being gay is not really legal and acceptable in our society ?
 chiur alter ego very big .
 in my opinion ,  i feel that isd perhaps can get some psychologist professional help to analyze the mind of this dickson yeo to come up with a profile of traits .
 then this profile can be quite helpful to id out people like him so can prevent such incidents from happening .
 take selfie to show his fang fang ?
 personally i think he is v beta ,  he bent his knee and raise his rear selling out his backside to another country .
 a weak minded fool who fall into some money or honey trapped ,  worse still even maybe voluntary .
 maybe wor ,  then this fang fang boost his ego then he kena tionged ?
 oni weak minded liddat can be easily exploit !
 what does it takes to make him betray his country ?
 study until phd cannot differential what &apos;s the right thing to do meh ?

 this is what happens when chiu still underpay technical skills during covid and the experienced workers leave resulting is hiring of cheap labor .
 even my company is feeling the effect .
 sue the hospital gao gao
 chiu dont have 10k a month chiu think it &apos;s alot .
 after chiu get it ,  it doesnt feel alot .
 trust me ,  i &apos;ve way more than 10k a month and it doesnt feel alot .
 managing expenses and expectations is more important if chiu want to be prudent .
 hey your expenses look similar to mine ,  but chiu have not added in the monthly meal ,  house hold grocery ,  pub ,  misc ,  online shopping ,  medical +++  ,  is actually more right ?
 and month end chiu wonder where the money gone ?
 the wife needs to work .
 she will pay for mobile ,  internet ,  utilities ,  groceries and other incidentals (eg kid go see doctor) .
 this comes to around $900 a month .
 cant even buy private property la  .
 1 year 100k after cpf ,  then spending leh ?
 if private property is 1 .
 5m chiu need 30 years to pay it down lol
 the missus will pay for groceries utilities etc .
 she keeps her savings .
 i keep little to none .
 its all documented .
 just in case women &apos;s charter is invoked .
 chiu will never earn 10k being happy trying to climb  .
 it &apos;s better u earn 6k ,  have property rental of 2k ,  dividends of 2k ,  small business of 3k ,  etc .
 nobody on hwz can understand cos edmwer smelly smelly oso 20k 
 darn glad i belong to the minority .
 $10k a month is way above average liao la ,  maybe top 25% .
 plus aws and 3 months bonus = $160k a year .
 if $120k a year maybe top 35%
 think need to do meticulous calculation on both your streams of incomes versus your detailed expenses .
 be principal ,  can do other jobs outside ?
 here comes all the csb bros .
 then those earning 2k plus how ?
 median salary of sinkies is 4k but median salary of ministers how much ?
 yes include car allowance .
 true income is still 8 .
 i can choose to take grab ,  public transport but no one in my industry does that .
 i’m taxed on the full 8 .
 5k at end of day so that is ard 100k assessable income where i’m paying 3k tax after deduction
 what industry so special de ?
 so 2k is sunken in per month for the car ?
 and what chiu mean by cpf 2 .
 are chiu sure chiu are in singapore ?
 it’s not sunken .
 it’s necessary cost for insurance ,  carpark ,  petrol ,  servicing and tax .
 remaining is loan repayment .
 all in below 2k .
 just a regular sedan la .
 upside is i can use for private purposes on weekends and can choose to drive grab if i want to .
 alternative is take public transport but with the frequent traveling it’s not safe and alot of walking and route planning to be made along with lugging along my belongings from point to point .
 2k is the deduction for cpf .
 but should be 1 .
 i am jobless chiu dont say
 thats why not enough chiu not using salary to live a life .
 earn 10k but live like 2k sianzzz

 i give chiu the honor to do this  
 i will do all her 3 holes given the chance  .
 careful chiu dont pika until kut tao sua hok .
 lastest one i will approaches cos i likes the slit
 what if she notice moi fwend &apos;s autobot rollout how ?
 can gib her to moi mah ?
 gxgx gone case liao .
 so much baggage chiu still take on .
 this type broken oredi .
 forget about forming a family with children with her ,  it is not going to be a happy family .
 ironic for your nick ,  but you &apos;re wrong .
 women friendships might be shallow as **** ,  but they will still put their shallow friendships above their boyfriends ,  cos they are naturally herd followers and the alpha bitch crab will always win the boyfriend .
 then all the more it &apos;s time to find a new person .
 i seriously cant believe you &apos;re 40+ but still acting like a teenager who just had his first kiss .
 that or you &apos;re a master troll way beyond me .
 then meaning that the girl doesnt love her boyfriend enough
 most probably she kena piak piak by others liao
 what is the age gap between u two ?
 after 2 weeks check color not healthy ts tio jialat jialat
 age gap 16 years
 can say u and your gf how old ?
 quit while your ahead then
 wa ,  is this csb thread
 not really la .
 im older than my wife by 8 yrs
 ts must get a prettier girl then her ,  tell her that the girl no problems in giving in to chiu .
 since she is insecure ,  she will change somehow ,  her time is up
 well ts ,  just let her go and find a better one ,  she oredi indirectly say that she doesnt wnat chiu anymore
 over liao ,  just end it there
 dont even waste time .
 just let it be .
 good leh always o3 .
 5 help us earn  money
 why is money still wasted on local soccer ?
 really chicken and egg issue - good then attract crowds or attract crowds ,  gain more $ then become good ?
 but i think by sg’s gahment standard best is no need invest anything but sky suddenly drop a few fandi ahmads .
 their training at most 2 hours a day .
 after matches got days off .
 just need to keep yourself fit nia .
 still can do part time .
 think need goal 2110
 wow $5xxx celery per month based on $126k / 24 months .
 kick soccer oso can earn so much .
 5k salary got include employer cpf contribution is it .
 this salary not bad liao ,  last time these clubs damn niaow gu .
 oni give yearly contract and some hardly hit 1 or 2k .
 wa whoseh s league no future .
 $120k for 2 years of kicking a ball around wor
 thats less than the average monthly salary of edmwers .
 u must be joking  .
 i league can attract people like forlan ,   anelka for short term last few months before retirement contract .
 no wonder even the pinoy ,  indonesia n malaysia league team can all outlast s league team in term of fitness during afc cup
 club manager or coach like fandi
 still got people follow kampong soccer 
 do grab pay better .
 office workers earn more than him anytime .
 go play 1-2 matches per week is very good pay le
 i earn more than him .
 but hey ,  his working hours shorter than anyone of us .
 so i think it &apos;s a trade off .
 maybe in the near future ,  parents can encourage their kids to take sports as a career .
 salary quite decent already
 what dialect and in mandrin how to pronounce .
 chinese is ni 2nd sound ,  dialect i dunno .
 what dialect group ?
 how can it be that oni singapore .
 got this chinese surname ?
 chiu mean the dialect version ?
 had 1 newsreader this surname iirc .
 who in the first place translate the chinese surname to engrish huan ?
 y the hell ni can even be gay
 i remember someone name is called gay chao hui
 is have no idea
 chinese pronouce ji
 niang niang qiang for long
 last time i sispec got one guy in my platoon with this surname
 siao ah ,  heater + labour + transport so ex ?
 practice free pricing sibei satki man .
 wai he said he not black merchant .
 he got sexplain ?
 even if use high end heater ,  got false ceiling installation need to hide and hack and replace and discard old unit oso less then 2k all expenses in with change to go casino .
 must sexpose the company big big .
 was the price agreed before installation ?
 at that price i rather buy 10 kettles and a big tub to mix the water myself everyday .
 it’s the buyer own self blur .
 the fb post oso admitted what ,  he quoted and she accept .
 ownself never do homework can blame who .
 this lady damn noob ,  must check price before engaging such services .
 but the contractor oso wtf la ,  3-4 thousand for a water heater ,  really treat her like kum gong .
 yeah this one is really self pawn ,  not like he told her is 300 dollars then finish oredi ask for 3350 .
 kum gong spotted
 my heat pump aos heater oso not so expensive 
 it &apos;s very funny leh .
 a few thousand liao yet she still went a head and pay .
 and later she still knew how to go check lazada .
 what does it say about her ?
 walan ,  really .
 chiu knew it was a pirate ship so chiu board 1st talk later ?
 yeah if someone openly states selling bak gua at 500 dollars per kg but got willing buyer ,  cannot complain later say elsewhere got people sell 50 dollars per kg only
 even the high end heaters at most $900
 maybe she is an edmwer ,  piak first talk later .
 typical stupiak people .
 she ownself say he quoted her the price and she agreed .
 i dont see what &apos;s the issue other than buyers remorse after checking online .
 she is a single mother with 3 children ,  of course her children safety is her priority .
 i think the electrician mentioned something will cause fire so she just pay .
 wa go see the google review on this contractor .
 one of the two reviewer said overpriced
 if u know she likes u ,  then u can test her character with cai png
 walans if realli can onli afford cai png as luxury ,  better not get gf la .
 otherwise dont kiam siap ,  bring your future chio bu waifu eat good thing go sexpensive praces ,  .
 it will be worth it in the end ,  the memories will be very nice one .
 how come your thread title in chinese one sia
 angmo= down to earth ,  easy going ,  frugal .
 sinkie= xiasuay ,  poor ,  bbfa
 i every day eat cai png leh ,  eat until pui pui
 my first actual date with wife was jiak dessert at hawker center outside fu lu shou complex leh .
 then go bugis mall .
 then jiak street food and drink fruit juice .

 the sex is good and she enjoys sex ,  so sextifying that period of time i totally never pcc  .
 it &apos;s the oni place can tell the girl she can order anything on the menu and no need worry about money !
 that’s why i say lor
 i take my money shui bian buy any cryptocurrency; literally shui bian buy as long as not scam projects ,  in a few months to a few years almost guranteed double ,  or triple my money ,  and all this money is mine and mine oni .
 the money that i put in my endowment plans ,  i need to wait so many fugging years ,  and i think my earnings not even 50% profit .
 with a family to feed and raise ,  10k is really not alot  .
 i feel should be 16k ec income ceiling .
 ec oso under hdb .
 why 10k cannot buy 2 room condo ?
 then how those people earn $2000 can have 6 kids  ?
 someone with a soviet robotic nick .
 look like any normal sinkie outside
 nothing new what ,  they mostly same profile ,  warped sense of self-worth type ,  delusional ones .
 here even got his comrades self proclaiming that they are millionaires despite just working a few hours a day ,  phd holders ,  king of science queen of science ,  look damn handsome like andy lau .
 with their delusion ,  if tonight got 1 of the dicksons here say he is the reincarnation of the king of atlantis and his wife is alice from wonderland ,  i oso will not be surprised
 cannot guess leh ,  who is the joker ?
 just buy a $800 headset ,  just as good .
 this one last time windows xp oso have  .
 my first set was kenwood ud90 ,  that was 1991
 i honestly cant tell the difference .
 maybe my ears got problem or my living room too small for surround liao .
 if angmo = sophisticated ,  enjoy life .
 if sinkie = kumgong ,  waste money
 now like lazy oredi .
 whatever shows just watch as they are  .
 unless my house has a spare room to accommodate ,   specifically for movies oni 
 mostly marketing gimmick .
 stereo headphones are still the best .
 why it sounds like india
 like a scene from final destination .

 maybe they use ceca staff
 isolated incident ,  please move on .
 is the mri machine damaged  ?
 straight out from terminator 4 ,  5 or 6 .
 the worker who died in india in a similar freak accident went into the mri room after his colleague assured him the machine had oredi been switched off !

 there she goes again .
 trying to stay relevant and remind others she &apos;s still around .
 hdb cui ,  call hdb la .
 see rats ,  call nea !
 she should really download the oneservice app
 so now xiaxue oni way of getting attention and viewership is by stirring people &apos;s saga and stirring wp ?
 learn how to make money producing proper content la .
 at least noc ,  jianhao focus on making money off commerical content .
 after all these years ,  she still hadn &apos;t improved her craft .
 the pictures didnt state the location ,  so did xiasway even verify that those locations are under aljunied grc ?
 trying her best to stay relevant
 many other mps oso dont directly answer emails ,  probably direct to the relevant authorities .
 she so rich ,  should stay in private house so she can dictate contractors to do her biddings with her cash .
 no need to involve town council as well .
 she voted wp or pap .
 if she voted pap then she &apos;s a free rider in aljunied
 ask this cb pinkhair fkface to shuddup la .
 can sylvia or alunjied town council sue her for defamation and fake news ?
 the problems she raised are probably under hdb anyway lol
 lol my place under wp ward maintain nice nice so  ?
 if not abt political agenda then why bring it in  ?
 she like to gong lanjiao wei sia
 common problems for old estates ,  go amk ,  tp or boon lay can see .
 this vlogger make it into a politcal issues ?
 better use the time to upskill than doing jlb things 
 i hope she realizes that when she goes stir wp ,  she will incur alot of wrath from its hardcore supporters  .
 year of rat mah .
 give chance la .
 left few months oni till cny before another animal appear .
 wa this xx is losing it .
 now looking for ways to gain publicity
 really hard to earn money
 got free money from sgpools mah .
 imagine your hobby is your job .
 chiu sure chiu still wanna be salaryman ?
 i rather 50% of what i earning now if my job is my hobby .
 future ends at 30s .
 max give u 40yrs old .
 other professional leagues got more sports science involved .
 they have individual regime ,  control your daily diet ,  schedule chiu to the gym ,  work on your weakness etc .
 they have more staffs like physio and fitness coaches for conditioning and recovery .
 i think i read before s league is not so advanced .
 otot ,  just turn up for training can liao .
 how to out last those players from better leagues ?
 maciam ngolo kante ah .
 a football player &apos;s career is relatively brief .
 chiu can oni play until you &apos;re 32-35 .
 if chiu are injured ,  which is quite common ,  chiu may be forced to retire sooner .
 after that ,  liao ,  chiu wont have much to do ,  and chiu wont be able to advance in your career .
 consider this scenario: a trainee receives a very low salary ,  works his or her way up to a peak salary of $5 , 000 for perhaps 2-3 years ,  and then receives no further compensation .
 backend jobs ,  such as coaching ,  are difficult to come by ,  and a large number of players apply .
 she under which area de ?
 sylvia lim take care peyar lebar leh  .
 if i not wrong the old csm area .
 tell her get her facts right before post online  .
 limpeh yck i kena 2 times dengue in my life  .
 this year my area over 100 case i oso never kaobei like her  .
 kena trashed by so many people without anyone helping her now try to stir sth that she know people will help her 
 her racist saga just over now stir oppo liao ah ?
 my wife oso 8 years younger ,  which i dont think is such a huge gap ,  acceptable .
 16 years though is pushing it a bit too far ,  i wouldnt date someone that much younger .
 wait so ts the issue is about sex ?
 thats why she wants to take a break to cool down ?
 that time moi gf wanna take a break oso then i reject her say cannot ,  at most 1 week but we text as usual everyday .
 but when she ask for break it &apos;s cos she wants to forget my past she said ,  and she was crying when she ask for the break .
 end up we didnt meet 3 days oni then both cannot tahan ,  we met up as usual after that .
 bump for final 1 week .
 siao liao gf kena ups by angmo or fuccbois liao
 wa is 8yrs common ?
 seldom hear such difference in age gap .
 if i am like u ,  my gf next time will be 16yrs old now wts .
 how u met her one sia

 she is playing chiu .
 give up and move on .
  dont play this sort of game with her .
  time to **** off and get another girl that appreciates chiu .

 thread closed at the request of ts .
 yah but i attached liao lol
 i wish i have a female fren .
 chiu means promise to be her backup .
 the sole proprietorship of her hole .
 joke joke nia  
 friend and female dont exist in bbfa dictionary
 the student i was tutoring told me this .
 in the end ,  she found someone else .
 average looking ,  but big chested .
 u think people simp like chiu meh ?
 grow a spine don’t kio leftovers lah
 yah but she married with kids liao… never realli contact for many many years liao 
 wa so kind hearted kope leftover
 well we didnt exactly promise to marry each other .
 we just promise to consider each other if both dont have anyone .
 when 30 came ,  i see a good friend chasing her .
 i think he is more suited for the high flying doctor .
 so ,  i never trigger .
 9 years after this ,  both of us are still single and my friend give up .
 going bride agency at the end of the year ,  while she probably expired and resigned to a life of singlehood .
 maybe small regret ,  but not that much .
 she changed alot ,  grown very atas and way out of my comfort zone .
 hopefully ,  she dont remember instead .
 for if she does ,  i really might keep my end of it .
 chiu watch japanese or korean drama ?
 marry liao still can b piak buddy
 in the life of bbfa ,  no such thing female and flen .
 sounds simp to me .
 meaning the guy is willing to wait and has no other choice
 imma gonna try in here .
 any bu here not married by 35 can hook me up 
 have some pride guys ,  dont be a spare tyre  .
 imagine next time ,  chiu can sit at home drive your semi-autonomous tractor to farm .
 no need to be under hot sun .
 single mother of 3 sigh .
 no wonder kena conned .
 maybe the heater powered by rtx3090 .
 thats why so expensive .
 go read la ,  is the lady looked for this plumber ,  the plumber quoted her before going down it is this price oredi .
 she accepted it and asked him to come down get installation done on emergency basis .
 after that she paid the agreed amount but later complain .
 the ironic she oni  &apos;checked &apos; after she paid .
 why cant she just do all this before paying ?
 totally save all the trouble n $
 it &apos;s like those hair salons selling overpriced packages using sales pressure .
 so are those cases blatant cheating or just normal transactions ?
 chiu said it bro .
 the money collected will rot him ,  and his whole family .
 dont worry too much .
 simi lanjiao free pricing ?
 but lik that oso chek ark mah .
 sell something cost so much more .
 sometimes on the spot hard to think properly when the seller mayb rushing u or said something to make u nervous esp abt safety issues .
 i nt wrong ,  last time overchg can go case report n claim bk .
 isnt sad same product and service can have wide gap of fees offered by different coys for common simple household product ?
 seems like a honest chap providing a honest service at a honest price .
 not oni tio scam by contractor ,  but oso tio scam by case .
 to complain to case ,  oni for them to say they cant do anything      .
 owner seems like got other companies if chiu google the name kwoi heng
 ya lor i dont undestand why she go ahead install  .
 errr it is well known case cannot do anything .
 still go pay ,  really is too much money ,  dunno where to spend
 even if guy selling service is jianshang ,  the lady oso a willing buyer .
 so what to do ?
 obviously this is gone case ,  just see whether case will do anything to the guy for future business or not .
 but very unlikely ,  else this kind of thing wouldnt happen oredi .
 he &apos;s on radio nao
 is true ,  hokkien or cantonese gays    .
 cantonese for chicken .
 in chinese pronounced ji (1st sound) .
 no ,  that would be gwee .
 got a uni msian fren with this surname .
 is ngai in canto .
 some other dialects dropped the nasal sound ng- becomes g- .
 so u got gei ,  gay or simply ge(h) in other dialects .
 gay means happy
 u imagine the nurse at the hospital call out patient surname gay .
  &apos;anybody gay in the crowd &apos;
 say no to homophobia
 he age so much !
 i have former classmate .
 hers is written as goy in dialect name .
 gay as a bluebird .
 but this quote when given to sinkies dont do well due to  &apos;bluebird &apos; .
 not common but got ex colleague with this surname
 my office oso got 1 gay guy just joined
 i want to marry her
 i mean her nehs 
 this type hard to survive in jav 
 phoon chiu yoke ?
 tan beow hiong ?
 dr christopher lee kwan chen ?
 yes ,  dont report is the best .
 we see how the other countries react .
 if malaysia ,  indo ,  india stops reporting ,  are chiu going to go there ?
 she &apos;s health minister ?
 those vax and kena no want to report is it ?
 hospitalisations data more meaningful
 what makes her so optimistic ?
 did she have one too many doses ?
 but very meaningful to have differentiated treatment ?
 she &apos;s the health minister &apos;s boss boss .
 she &apos;s the health minister &apos;s boss &apos; boss 
 dont report see who want to come in .
 this is funny indeed .
 lai liao lai liao ,  so this is how they are going to deal with the truth that vaccination doesnt protect the vaccinated ,  no report no case !
 can so many die from common flu ,  y not try stroll in the airport arrival hall n welcome flights from high risk areas without masks
 she should just retire and stay in the kitchen .
 dowager giving sinkies a preview of what &apos;s coming next ?
 flu oso dont discriminate between vaxx and unvaxx wor 
 can even no need mask ?
 nowadays dunno who is really chio bu when everyone putting on mask .
 just look st other countries .
 we still got a grp that cannot be vaccinated ,  the kids below 12 years old .
 when they start dropping .
 still mask on to protect them .
 love how she says not to hyperventilate over import numbers .
 and what properly cleared on arrival m .
 we are so fked now cos of delta imports ,  and how changi fked up its procedures and started the spread into community .
 test balloon launched .
 sheep now waiting in line to accept bs
 this is why we need racial profiling .
 so he accepted a plea deal ,  now turn around and sue the police is it  ?
 reminds me of this gta v skit: .
 easy free money
 thats the other shane .
 the white shane .
 lucky him ,  their police see black man with wanted name usually shoot first
 is ah gong showing his displease ?
 water not means wealth ?
 heaven will rain for 7 days 7 nights before it removes the mandate of heaven away from the emperor .
 lky crying in his grave seeing his son failed to lead sinkieland properly
 raining meaning someone good just died .
 heard from old people .
 duno how true .
 then when chut sua time ,  will rain kan heavy .
 i thought almost over liao .
 starting no rain mah ,  i oredi prayed finish
 drought is a curse .
 water is wealth .
 which era chiu from ?
 rain and chiu think it &apos;s a sign from god ?
 no offense but .
 in the event pinky uplorry means the rain will become super heavy until flood 2 meter that kind ?
 i was lucky ended my run at jurong central park just now .
 about to rain then i chiong to bas interchange go home
 its not a  &apos; long winded &apos; rain ,  it will just pour heavily for 5-10mins .
 singapore or singapur ?
 oh dear ,  what is the covid situation there now ?
 as of 2001 india census , [3] singapur had a population of 23 , 458 .
 males constitute 51% of the population and females 49% .
 singapur has an average literacy rate of 55% ,  lower than the national average of 59 .
 5%: male literacy is 62% ,  and female literacy is 48% .
 in singapur ,  11% of the population is under 6 years of age .
 sounds like u sending signals into space
 ts : your fren is chio or dino ?
 must look like michelin woman ,  or else he sure up oredi .
 he would rather marry vietnamese village girl with foot long parasites in her intestines than his good friend ,  which he promised to marry .
 good morning ,  mr simp !
 chiu think chio ts will still ding dong here ding dong there meh ?
 yes i did when i was in sec school .
 she &apos;s my best friend .
 she still single but i married last year liao .
 i got one friend 29 next year 30 .
 want to ask her this but scared later we friend alsocannot be
 later your female fren becume bui bui how ?
 most female become bui bui with age
 dont have this chance since most of my female friends are more bro than potential gf or wife .
 i heard of this pact before .
 one girl ,  vietbu 7/10 ,  she made a pact with a bui bui guy 3-4/10 ,  that if she still single by 30 ,  they consider each other .
 the guy not the most good looking ,  but would consider as good fortune if he managed to get the vietbu girl
 things can change but close friends never will .
 i know a couple who made that promise and they were still single after all their friends got married .
 they were really close friends and one day the guy broached the topic to the girl .
  &apos;eh ,  let &apos;s get married .
  &apos; the girl was super chill about it ,  she said ok why not .
 and he bought a ring and proposed to her on the bus .
 till today still married .
 ya i promised to married her if by 50 she is still single .
 yah have ,  then she got married .
 before i bbfa ,  she promise .
 after i bbfa ,  she break promise
 and i have a bui bui wife now as a result  .
 oni dino bu want me to promise her if she not marry off by 30 ,  want me .
 sounds like a sad story there .
 oni phase 1 style of cb will work .
 the longer they drag the more pain the economy will suffer
 go back to phase 1
 isnt there a oneservice app to write feedback and send screenshots ?
 looks like xia xuay is very bored .
 stir as much as possible to seek attention 
 tried for 2 days ,  unable to connect to server 
 someone should reply this to xiasuay: .
 do chiu know why pap tend to ignore lim tean spewing accusations at them but they would more likely to pofma normal citizens ?
 cos lim tean is always taking sh*t that has no substance .
 now chiu know why slyvia lim ignores chiu ?
 she probably will get some kind of backlash 
 been to hdb under pap oso sibei jialat .
 maybe next time i should oso take photo as proof .
 well if cable ties is good enough for mrt tracks ,  its good enough for wires at least .
 didnt know poor maintenance will cause danger to resident ?
 fall from steping on tissue paper or peeling paint ?
 my estate oso use paint to cover cracks in different color .
 signs of intelligence deficiency .
 plus the pictures 4 out of 6 are minor ones .
 just use cement n sand can solve de or get a lew work faster change can liao  .
 since when her job is manageing agent ?
 she nevrr complain other estates never even check fire hoose issues  ?
 she have lots of time to complain to the media with so much comparison .
 and her own complaint about her own estate have to be done by her mum .
 what is she busy with all the time  ?
 ahtc says her feedback is noted liao ,  and some interim repairs are made oredi .
 so hopefully she stops her politicking .
 no time to complain to town council .
 need her mom to complain on her behalf .
 but got time to write jjww social media posts 
 woman dies after bukit batok fire in which hose reels could not be used .
 jurong town council
 please cancel this comprain queen  .
 anything dat comes out of her mouth is just noise
 she better hope this stunt dont inspire tons of opposition supporters to go around their pap area and hunt down all the maintenance issues lol .
 later we see every few day ,  pap managed town councils get hit with various complaints 
 so why no @victor .
 given her rep of saboing miw unintentionally ,  highly likely .
 former pasir ris senior constituency manager cheated residents &apos; committee vice-chairman of cash ,  gets jail .
 pasir ris town council
 my bukit batok smc is worse la .
 some potholes on road and all other issues oredi pointed out by csj but how soon has murali resolved these problems ?
 if csj is not publicising these issues ,  would some issues have been resolved or not chiu go and guess lor .
 waste time waste money .
 at least she got the heater from the contractor .
 she got nothing from case !
 so next time if she buy a resale hdb flat .
 the owner quote her 1 million but average transaction price for the same block is 300k .
 she agrees to it ,  sign contract to buy .
 after that regret say kena scam ?
 really is willing seller ,  willing buyer mah
 then why shop selling mask for $50 per box will kena investigate ?
 i got charged doubled for part and installation of sink tap .
 at first i thought it was too much .
 but this contractor is charging way to much .
 prey on the weak and ignorant .
 if the contractor were to deal with the man of the house ,  probably wont charge that much .
 dont stupid la .
 i mean ofc she stupid but lawyer $1000 vs $100 big diff .
 i even willing to pay $10k or $100k no problem if the lawyer worth his price .
 this one clear cut nowhere near $3000+ how to justify ?
 wtf is case doing ?
 her fault is being too trusting of people .
 my way of life now is to treat everyone as an arsehole
 wanna earn money is ok but triple the market rate is too much lah
 i can calling it what it is ,  she said she kena cheated but where got ?
 the merchant never quote her one lower price and then later give some reason to up price cheat money .
 the merchant upfront quote her the high price and she accepted ,  how can she say she got cheated ?
 did the merchant bluff her ?
 3350$ can buy rtx 3080 gaming computer siol
 next time aunty charge me 10 cent more for egg .
 limpeo go case .
 the plumber is clearly overcharging and fleecing her but the customer oso never bothered to even verify online first for industry rates .
 at most a couple hundred should do it .
 jover chew all over again ?
 whose side will u be on ?
 it &apos;s her fault for not doing her research before installation at this price .
 she accepted the price quoted .
 not like the man didnt tell her the price and installed without her agreement .
 thus this case is not cheating .
 on the other hand ,  the plumber has a case now .
 can sue her for libel since his reputation is tarnished now .
 edmw alot of white knight ,  if the person happened to be a man or ceca ,  they would say kumlan .
 deserved it etc .
 who cuts his hair and nails ?
 why bo lang want take moderna ?

 moderna &apos;s side effect is more hiong than pfizer .
 knn ,  i got low grade fever and chills for 2 days with 3 days of muscle ache .

 there are so many litters in parliament 
 i bet $500 geraldine soo got do the same sh !
 put empty cardboard boxes beside hdb rubbish chute waiting for cleaners to kio
 more to come next time carrier are chargeable u will see my waste around .
 article put beside bin ,  your thread title put inside .
 ts know the difference between  &apos;inside &apos; and  &apos;beside &apos; or not ?
 or is fail psle english/blind kind ?
 dont put insai bin then put where ?
 this geraldine soo considers herself holier than white ,  she never commit any form of litter in her life before ?
 this geraldine soo is toking cork is it ?
 heng i got karang guni granny and her family staying on the 9th floor of my block .
 i always give her my empty brown shipping cartons and unwanted electric appliances .
 even my old fridge she oso take in and strip and recycle the parts .
 very hardworking and healthy granny .
 70 years old this year .
 immigrated to singapore from cheena in the 1990s .
 good question ,  big cardboard boxes how to dispose ?
 walk to nearest rubbish centre and hand it to town council cleaners ?
 if they happen to be not in then cannot throw outside it and must carry all the way back home ?
 if bin full put inside geraldine soo mouth
 must stack high high .
 whoever stack until everything falls will be fined .
 it &apos;s sinkies way of covering up their laziness by saying  &apos;i put near rubbish bin what ,  it &apos;s ok ,  the cleaners can clear it &apos;
 if bin full ,  officially supposed to find an empty bin elsewhere .
 or bring your rubbish home .
 if i get fine for putting litter next to a bin ,  then next time limpeh just throw the litter on the floor sua
 how many people are vaccinated for flu right now ?
 flu oso has 600 deaths per year ,  so let &apos;s get ready for that .
 she leader of singapore ?
 why is she talking so much recently ?
 is any country (not ceca land !
 ) going to form any sort of travel arrangement with us if we dont report ?
 delta is so transmissible .
 even dengue ,  we report where the clusters are so that people can make an informed decision and avoid if possible .
 dont understand why we dont do for covid
 why need to report something that ,   .
 if the population is fully-vaccinated ,   .
 the death rate is much less than normal flu ?
 cos ,  if the population is fully vaccinated ,  .
 the kill rate is much much less than dengue and normal flu even
 yes please sweep all cases under the carpet .
 we need to maintain the reputation of these  &apos;highly effective &apos; vaccines
 fail to control the pandemic then say no need numbers .
 cos chiu still have a sizable population that doesnt have full protection from the vaccine
 if really decided one path ,  good .
 hubby and frens have backed out so many times .
 normal flu need oxygen if case is severe ?
 when one has flu ,  do they get discriminated ?
 with spouse like this ,  husband can fast uplorry
 ownself choose one .
 dont want to vaxx dont blame others
 haha i just said ,  they intend to let the number of infected cases just fly and focus on severe and death .
 open the floodgate and let our masters flood us with new variants then they change their script again .
 even uk report .
 the first country in the world not to do so  ?
 oh my wise lady ,  we have been begging to stop the count for the past month as the numbers have been misused by the antivaxxers to spread fear and misinformation .
 once the count is stopped ,  most will not religiously follow the numbers and we can all treat covid as nth but a bad case of common cold .
 i love to eat prata
 & pappies nose need leepork .
 is it her block even anot ?
 i thought she very atas one got live in old lokkok block one ah ?
 angmo kio town council investigating cause of pipe choke after fecal matter overflow at void deck .
 amk town council
 this kind of jlb individual kpkb can post on asiaone ?
 xiasuay so free to write nasty things about people online no time to write to her own town council ?
 sounds like a total csb and smear campaign to me sia .
 we can complain alot  .
 one thing i find weird is  .
 the bangala use the blower blow leaves after culster fark them altogether never see them sweep the pile up  .
 wtf then why blow it make the area no noisy haha .
 plus her pictures are minor issues  .
 go pap estates easily can find them
 bb residents now making use of csj to push murali to act 
 hdb block facade issue  - hdb problem leh .
 her mother is stupid ,  so is she
 now now ,  xiasuay provoked chiu .
 let &apos;s be civil and not bring her mother into this .
 she is teaching us how to make our town council work harder for us .
 especially those pap-managed town councils
 sylvia is not even assigned to her area .
 it was under csm .
 edit nvm why she take photo of other grcs ?
 social media influencer .
 mommy living in jurong writing to mp in aljunied grc .
 well it was her that bring her mother into her complaints .
 she want to write stuffs she have to responsible for her own words .
 can i write to town council how her pink car causes nightmare for the young ones in the area ?
 piang stop making ugly people famous leh .
 chiu post those chiobus i still can tolerate
 still waiting for her letters to appear .
 and some of the picture oso not tc issues .
 got pic of her with pap lightning tattoo on her face right ?
 read through ahtc reply and seems reasonable  .
 basically non-emergency defects will be consolidated and rectified during periodic renovations while others will be acted on separately .
 then again the broken cement screed flooring most likely is damaged by the owner of those flower pot la .
 why still give her attention ?
 she is doing this oni for attention .
 1st known death from omicron  ?
 lai liao lai liao  .
 hope @adenovirus bro stay safe .
 wow ,  not underlying condition ah ?
 if omicron accounts for 40% of the cases ,  and oni 1 death is attributed to it ,  then i dont see the problem .
 it seems to be like flu ?
 we will know better in one month time .
 they just had their first case on nov 27 i think .
 just roughly 2 weeks now .
 covid might not kill in 2 weeks .
 maybe their conditon deteoriates and they die after a month or so ?
 mai kia la ,  sinkie faizai batch no faulty one ,  is merdeka gen like pokemon .
 weak to underlying conditions .
 but so far ,  details have been scanty dont chiu think ?
 like ,  how many cases in intensive care that have confirmed to be infected with omicron .
 that leads me to think that none of those in icu worldwide are infected with omicron .
 i fervently hope so .
 it &apos;s still early days my friend
 yeah ,  so far like not many icu cases of omicron .
 or maybe it takes time to deteoriate .
 or its just not as deadly .
 hopefully the latter .
 thats what mainstream news  ,  governments and pharmas tells everyone and expects us to repeat the same message to each other .
 what if there was a  &apos;incubation &apos; period before something worse happens ?
 dont forget this is still very new .
 havent pass a month since first detection .
 the way i see it ,  pharmas are hyping it up ,  not downplaying omicron .
 same with the news and gahment &apos;s .
 wuhan institute of virology gain of function is satki
 all same asking chiu to jab more .
 scully this variant might lead to a fast n sudden death .
 tt 1 person is vax or no vax or vax with booster ?
 vladimir putin say omicron symptoms are so mild ,  it may be a live covid vaccine .
 why uk never think about that ?
 pap ministers told sinkies to endemic living with covid ,  just like the common flu .
 now omicron making pap words come true .
 must be some underlying condition
  &apos;we know nothing about this new variant but chiu should all still take boosters !
  &apos;current vaccines seem ineffective against omicron but chiu should all still take boosters !
  &apos;omicron is much more transmissible than delta although the effects are milder ,  but chiu should all still take boosters !
  &apos;omicron finally have 1 recorded death after 2 weeks and spreading across the globe ,  faster take boosters !
 do chiu smell something fishy ?
 obviously someone dont want to step down as promised .
 last time in 2015 ,  pap said tharman is too old to be pm .
 in 2021 ,  hsk is oredi as old as tharman in 2015 .
 power is addictive .
 grace fu answered during press it’s due to curveball thrown by covid .
 covid very useful
 heng sway kia should cite health issue rather than age .
  act sick and stay hospital then claim health dont permit him to run as pm .
 he is not that low to lie .
 tell the truth (or half truth) n people will respect him more .
 ts why u like so surprised ?
 do u know when your kukujiao steam and non-steam mode is very big difference in length in just a matter of few seconds ?
 simple ,  very simply .
 mother wants to retire from tummy sick .
 father oso getting senile and weak .
 so son is now ready to take over the dynasty .
 goldfish eye ,  to be fair to him is an affable and nice man .
 many sinkies loved him and his benevolent style .
 so actually if he carried on and his popularity is enhanced then if suddenly asked to give up his seat then the public would be disquieted .
 oso he is quite a capable leader and man .
 though maybe excellent in admin and management he does not have the temperament to be a hatchet and ruthless fighting cock man who dared to kill and pulled up even all the roots of his adversaries to be in power .
 thats what &apos;s we called an operations man an organisation is why they dont really do all the mundane administrative works but as an kuailan rsm who orders one and all .
 oso ,  he must have this temperament to deal with hyenas ,  wolf ,  leopards and crows and black panthers .
 unscrupulous world scoundrels leaders and oso even internal people as well .
 it chiu have oppo leaders like lin tean ,  pritram singh who are the vocal and fighting cocks types that chiu are dead in meeting them .
 for tcb and others they are from the same school of affable and gentle type of people who will oni debate gentlemanly .
 so let come to how &apos;s the succession to the throne .
 he will put kee chiu to warm up the chair like woody goh .
 then next election his beloved son will oso be elected in .
 now he will have a long runway to understudy under his father .
 why needed a long runway ?
 if chiu are the smart type chiu can always run your own shows with no need of understudying all the ministries .
 cos chiu would oso be influenced by the still old and mundane policies .
 chiu must be a fresh man with different out of the boxes ideas to run your own .
 a peeayam is the captain of the ship so he must be competent to run the whole ship and not let others run his ship .
 so for wongliangpopo and orr yew tang ,  these two are very ambitious and dangerous men .
 they are what &apos;s i described pm materials as they are both aggressive and fighting cock men .
 so they be put in cold storage .
 so the best choice would be kee chiu as he is the clown who is just a court jester to waste away his time .
 as long as these jokers are been fed well they would not rebel .
 just wait for the right time to try again .
 so my guess is that keechiu will be the warm up seat man as he can be get rid of easily to have the holy son take over .
 chiu watch star wars ?
 got see emperor palpatine stepping down willingly ?
 covid gives pinky an excuse to stay longer .
 the longer the covid period the better for him .
 the son is coming u wait .
 he will fast track .
 lol as if their words can believe ,  ts dont tell me now then u realise lolol
 oneself played oneself age discrimination bo tai chi swee boh
 ownself set ownself standards mah
 very likely health reason oso .
 the fact he cant string his thoughts together in recent showings .
 but age reason can dump into those jlb portfolio .
 at least can still earn millions .
 30 plus ,  clear to take off
 he may thought he will be pm last year but then .
 guy a: the grass is greener on the other side ,  on your side guy b .
 the grass is greener on the other side ,  on your side guy a .
 disagreement ,  then argument start .
 grass here means pubes right ?
 i knew it was a ghey thread .
 7k last 24hr nia .
 havent break old record .
 chiu can do it motherland !
 usa highest is 4 .
 experts say numbers higher than reported
 i daresay usa tests much more people per day .
 4k a day is an achievable target for motherland
 kachang puteh la
 still got tons coming to singapore .
 keep it up india !
 chiu can achieve !
 guess more indians are going to die .
 not unnecessary a bad thing if the virus loses its transmission vectors .
 all those who shout racism should be sent to india .
 all time high of 1m dead a day hopefully !
  drop below 4 lakhs .
 all these with under reporting .
 inaccurate testing  ,  fake testing and bs .
 reality should be multitudes higher
  entire country of 1 .
 4 billion needs to be infected .
 i wouldn’t wish death on people .
 they are lives just like yours .
 if chiu have to blame ,  blame the policymakers .
 with mouldy ,  cecadia can oni get better
 1 billion to go
 india &apos;s real covid death toll could be 10 times higher than official count​ .
 i had a  female friend while growing up - she was 12 and i 13 .
 both were ugly ducklings and so promised we will marry each other if we single by 30 .
 she suddenly had a growth spurt after 14 and became a swan .
 she is now married to a swede in sweden ,  and has two kids .
 im a leftover bbfa with nobody to love .
 fugg my life    
 more like when she is 30 ,  she let u piak for free to get pregant and force u marry her .
 if i say i marry her if she left over at 30s she will luff at me and say she will never marry beh kan !
 got ,  but just to test water see how she reacts to the idea ,  shortly after that got together and jiak cherry 
 yes ,  a few actually .
 after that they like super motivated and got married soon after .
 got one migrated overseas the day before she hit 30 .
 now looking at the 40 years old list .
 got no girl want to come near me 
 dont make this kind of promise lol
 haha i oso had a few .
 end up all become fwb cos we decided to  &apos;trial &apos;  .
 ended up marrying none of them 
 this is very funny .
 scare die people
 does it mean can play till 30 ?
 but we both got attached later on and subsequently got married .
 she married about two years later than me .
 divorced means single or not ?
 later chiu buy 1 get 2 free .
 now oredi year 2021 still got this kind of thing meh .
 why make this type of promises ?
 is like they promise tracetogether wont use for other purposes
 does the couple have children oredi ?
 this could be the case where new people around them thought they were a couple though not officially an item due to their day-to-day actions .
 thus never approach .
 got but they always get attached before 30 
 my ex promise to wait for me while i working oversea .
 ended 2 yrs later she went back to her ex .
 yea i finally get to marry my 35 yo gf after she was dumped with a blue eyes baby
  &apos;inside &apos; polling station boh tai ji ,   .
  &apos;outside &apos; polling station then dua tai ji .
 must find thoes pang chance law to let us know they are legit to fine us
 my friend got fined by nea officers for placing an empty can on the bin ,  not in it cos it was full .
 he got really mad and argued with the officer ,  then escalated from simple littering case to abusing public servant .
 after several trips to the court for a year ,  settled with 1 .
 chiu can never win them .
 they are making pissed people to now litter when confirming no one is looking .
 in nature reserves it is and must be a big deal .
 bins there all purposely designed to counter animals from accessing easily and digging for huat stuff ,  which will lead to them associating easy food with bin areas .
 in those reserves ,  chiu lay them outside nicely around the special bins to the monkeys its just free buffet and helps them associate the spot ,  the dustbin and observed humans that bring stuff there as easy food .
 easy to lead to established behaviour in the community such as raiding humans holding plastic bags .
 never supposed to leave trash in reserves anyway ,  anywhere in the world .
 chiu go yellowstone park do this confirm kena kan .
 they say ,  leave with nothing but memories .
 but 10year series never test so fark dat eh ?
 elsewhere be it neighbourhood park ,  outside cine ,  clarke quay .
 its just regular pest business if chiu leave trash around bin ,  at least those roaches ,  crows ,  rats are not higher order animals that are capable of exhibiting hostile territorial behaviour against humans .
 instead of making differential policy for leaving trash outside bins for citizens that cant be bothered with thinking about the logic for things that affect their convenience .
 just ban wholesale sua .
 then reduce public trash bins by say 70% in taiwan lol
 what about those smokers who flicked its ashes off their cigs to the floor ?
 then spitting leh ?
 flick or wipe boogers on poles or on the floor or anywhere convenient ?
 wa ts dio pofma-ed 
 when people dont have the care culture this is what happen .
 they simply dont care .
 what they care is get all as ,  pawn eachother to bring others down .
 when the bin is full just walk to the next bin it is less the 100 meter la .
 even near every lift got bin .
 majority of sinkie have entitlement mentality syndrome
 next time tear into small piece and throw down the chute le ?
 huh what logic  ?
 then liddat how ,  eat the rubbish then  ?
 wa thread title tio changed ?
 empty cardboards are supposed to go into blue bins .
 tell that to those people putting flyers on car and on hdb gates .
 ts tio flagged by admin sia
 complain to propnex and all the agents then .
 or find ways of using excuses to cover up
 u are right bro
 my experience with car batteries : .
 hybrid car batteries .
 first 5 years under warrantee so no problem when it broke down on the 4th year .
 on the 7th year ,  battery spoil again .
 quoted $14 , 000 for the battery .
 i quickly sold the car .
 now normal car battery ,  life span oni 1 year 7 months .
 i can imagine ,  next time electric cars battery price is going to cost a bomb .
 they r down playing cos they still betting on outdated vaccines n anyhow ask people to quickly go jab boosters for eg sinovac 3rd jab
 must shame this fucker of a company .
 hope it closes
 jover chew is different ,  that one is quote lower price ,  then after paying the lower price said this price dont include etc etc and if want etc etc pay alot more .
 this case is straight forward quote high price and she accepted willingly .
 even u go shoppee/lazada got some sellers sell same item at 4 to even 10 time the price of other seller .
 if u lazy just buy at whatever came up and it happens to be the much higher price seller ,  then u cannot say the seller is cheating you
 too bad this one is chinese lady .
 got the name of the company so everyone can avoid ?
 i changed to the aos water tank heater oso oni $750 .
 sibei chek ark~ really is black shop with a black heart~
 yah loh when it comes to female ,  really lotsa white knight jump in to defend
 not black shop but a greedy contractor .
 this is how contractors and freelance blue collar workers earn their mercs and bmws .
 chiu noob ,  chiu lose
 he is not a cheat ,  but he sure is shrewd opportunist .
 yup i understand and agree to a certain extend tof your point but chiu mention the mechant/plumber quoted her a figure and she accepted with no changes to the figure at all .
 what i want to know is how did the merchant come up with such a big figure ?
 understand this is maybe in teh middle of a night with a single parent 3 kids to take care of their basic bathing needs .
 is it ethtical of the merchant to quote this figure ?
 no right or wrong answer la ,  just interested to know why some people go all the way just to earn some more money .
 in your context ,  to make it relevant ,  ad car is $60m ,  when u go home google pi is $4m .
 will chiu cry foul ?
 if chiu say no ,  ok noted no cure for stupiak
 reali need hot water bath so badly at night
 want to do business ,  dont be ashamed of maximizing profits .
  i feel that the company owner is a hypocrite .
 want to carrot others yet feel defensive when being exposed  .
  what does he intend to do now ?
 refund a chunk of money to the customer  ?
 talk is cheap; just wayang oni .
 yours is inclusive of tank + installation charges right ?
 any got full article to share ?
 nothing wrong sia .
 ownself agree one - quite sure the contractor never take knife or gun force her agree .
 he hire phua chu kang to install that’s why so ex .
 anyone want to join me ?
  please sign up in this thread .
 please say what skill chiu have that makes chiu able to hunt werewolves .
  this is not a masak masak mission .
  werewolves are real and very malicious creatures of the night .
 for me ,  i am very apt at making and using crossbows .
 tickets of course chiu ownself pay .
 in siao lang thread
 how about that werewolf clan living in this place call forks in washington state of the usa ?
 ts has taken them on before ?
 tiagong they defeated the most powerful vampire family in an epic battle about 10 years ago .
 van helsing wannabe ?
 what did i just read 
 ts can get pass those angmo who wants to hoot chiu first then say 
 eastern europe so big ,  can specify location ?
 if werewolves ho jiak ,  sign moi up 
 cannot reveal now ,  in case the werewolves got intelligence in singapore then they relocate .
 i am sure they serve edmw oso 
 i l150 nightlord using ilbi throwing star .
 dont worry covid will never end .
 ah gui can scare the werewolves 
 but time &apos;s up .
 guards ,  please strap him up and escort him back in his cell .
 singapore don’t have werewolves ah  ?
  welcome to the party !
 hope ts get eaten by werewolves
 i think angmo will find the wolf inside your kang chin kang before u can find it .
 scared u shorten chiur life with all the piakking…
 can go there retire and jiak cheesepie but low living cost part .
 depends on where rah
 cheena dont want chiu la .
 move to msia better
 jack mah and all the billionaires want to escape cheena .
 u want to enter inside
 it is a populous country ,  usually people migrate to less populous country with more resources to spare per capita .
 is definitely a good idea since this will help us purge those that fail darwin theory from our own society .
 i oso had same thinking  .
 thinking of tier 2 cities ,  i think xiamen and hainan culturally closer to us
 what is cheap in japan ?
 almost everything is cheaper unless chiu live in the centre of tokyo .
 people dont even want to buy property cos rent one is cheaper .
 and chiu can have all the 500 yen meal .
 depends where chiu intend to live in cheena ,  international tier cities like shanghai ,  beijing ,  shenzhen & guangzhou are at the same cost of living if not more expensive than singapore .
 some other factors to consider is healthcare facilities and can chiu adapt to the food and culture in the place chiu retire in cheena .
 healthcare facilities in upper tier cities can match singapore ,  but one has to lower expectations on software aspects .
 if one has the expectations that everything must be singapore standards and are not prepared to adapt oneself ,  i can say it &apos;s better stay in singapore .
 if can adapt and mingle around with the locals ,  chiu have a huge place to explore when one settle down in cheena .
 haha depending on which cities .
 when chiu old liao ,  what is more impt ?
 japan is more much better
 problem is how to prove chiu are from chinese descendent  .
 show your nric .
 do chiu have chinese characters on it ?
 not talking about individual .
 talking about the population .
 especially the vulnerables in the population
 it is the duty of gahment to report ,  dont find excuse cos chiu are lazy ,  we pay tax ,  chiu do your job .
 this i dont agree .
 covid isnt flu .
 and u dont have to vaccinate against flu to dine in .
 and cos the transmission rate is so high ,  and vaccine effects wane over time ,  breakthroughs are not rare ,  .
 so even if the population fully vaccinated ,  they &apos;ll be occasions of outbreaks .
 that &apos;ll negate the low kill rate effect .
 most importantly ,  the kill rate for covid is not lower than dengue and normal flu
 hope the pro-vax oso kena jialat jialat after everything open lol
 liddat dunnid mask too liao lor good good
 israel got coronavirus czar .
 maybe singapore should have one above mtf
 seem like all the crappy directives and ideas came from this ugly man .
 buy high sell low yo .
 cos she wanna hide the cases of the fully vaxxed
 flu not so serious  .
 ceca and jhks all will chiong in .
 they gonna test the unvax more often so if there &apos;s any cases ,  its all from the unvax .
 vaccination is known not to be the solution  .
 so why are they going to do this ?
 will normal flu leave your lung having scars ?
 ownself say endemic ownself run inside hole when got explosion lmao song boh 61%
 once no report .
 it &apos;s your words against theirs  .
 just like local = sinkie and pr .
 need to whack how long then say then distinguish the employment between them .
 first they hide import numbers  .
 then they hide whereabouts of infected cases .
 now wanna hide infection numbers  .
 sinkies really jin cham .
 die of covid oso dunno how they die
 more meaningless than the number is what she is saying
 just need sincere opinion .
 i recommend my friend a ico .
 i told him to do a bit first so he bought $1000 usdt to put inside the ico .
 the ico is those ido and in the end he didnt do anything cos he didnt get my step right .
 he told me i wasted his $1000 .
 i replied it not wasted at all as it still in usdt .
 he told me if i am sincere in helping him ,  i should do video conferencing with him and walk him through the steps one by one .
 i replied there so many tutorial and youtube video online and i oredi wrote the steps in whatsapp and he jitao dulan .
 if someone has the interest ,  they will find the things out one way or another .
 no point forcing .
 this kind just want u to spoon feed them and get free $$$
 this is why i don’t push my friend and siblings .
 money involved and could ruin relationships
 did chiu earn comms from him ?
 if no then tell your friend to fly kite .
 i know that ico is a winner so i told my friends to get in
 likewise i dont do relative business
 no comm then your friend is a fugger useless charsiew who expects people to spoonfeed him .
 if he lose money he blames everyone but himself .
 word of advice is to cut this friend loose .
 lucky it didn’t go through .
 cos it will be a dud .
 chiu saved him from losing his $1000
 any similar experience ?
 no friend no such problem .
 ts at fault lor
 quote for truth
 let him wasted his money ba .
 until he ownself research how to liquidate it
 both at fault : .
 if u like something u taught urself .
 if u dont like it u make someone teach u
 if chiu want to recommend something then be prepare to guide .
 can yoy be my friend ?
 i need your genuine recimmendation .
 sinopharm is best after sinovac (click here)
 support pfizer due to viagra fame ?
 what did the doc say 
 don’t want please kindly donate to us taiwan .
 we want moderna much more than az
 your master ,  japan ,  loves chiu all deep deep leh ,  why dont want ?
 dr fauci took moderna .
 all the lao hero in the neighborhood spreading pfizer pah liao ran jiao ting kok kok
 singkis scaredy cats
 i pa moderna leh
 tiagong moderna &apos;s vaccine more stable and they got more years experience working on it .
 cause pfizer taken by ministers
 i took moderna  ,  i read on straits times 160 .
 chances of fever higher  ,  but lesser chance on allergies  vs pfizer .
 so decide urself
 actually till now who knows whether this is useful against the ceca variant or not
 az is sub par la honestly
 i heard is cause kids can oni jab pfizer for now .
 and some families prefer all take the same one .
 all humji liao  .
  no more chiong  ?
 i took moderna .
 after first jab my arm damn pain for 3 days .
 oso felt super lethargic .
 ate panadol for 2 days .
 pfizer manufactures viagra .
 maybe they &apos;re expecting their kkb to be stronger as side effect of taking the pfizer jab .
 is cos the boss assess him to be like yr nick la .
 pinky wants to get rid of hsk but still need  excuse to keep tharman out of contention
 maybe someone is angry that he was not passed the baton as planned .
 cos not the chosen one ,  ownself give up better save face ?
 really no foresight
 fumbling heng wants to lie abt  &apos;age issue &apos; ,  at least look at the guy beside him .
 obviously the puppet master has other plans
 ya ,  cos that time the plan was to let him ascend the throne at 60 ,  who knew his boss now want to extend .
 if wait until next ge will be too old liao ,  very fast need to hand over again ,  so just give up now lor  
 i said before the son will need  to get in fast ,  hopefully some mp will die or resign within months ,  then a local election and a quick tour in cabinet and appoint to be dpm ,  tada ,  nicely done .
 dynasty carry on  .
 taxes heng suddenly forgot about his age  .
 means senile liao not fit for office  .
 should immediately resign from all his posts

 walan eh u really believe his rubbish ?
 simi short runway ,  look at tcb ,  when he wants to serve ,  he just comes back to run as opp .
 he older than hsk by 20yo  .
 u think he cares whether his runway is short or long or whether he can tank the full term as mp .
 covid happened ,  and tbh it &apos;s shitty time to passover to new pm .
 postpone a bit oso cannot wait ,  the dude really chao quitter .
 promise one after another la ,  you &apos;re late .

 chiu know she is up to no good
 xx is well known to stir controversy to boost her fame
 she never voted for sylvia lim .
 what more does she want ?
 cancel not enough ?
 my estate appeared in the news lol parliament topic .
 in the end how ?
 still brushed off by indranee rajah .
 at night got noise or what ,  call police ,  police oso dont bother to come .
 beats xiaxue &apos;s word of mouth stories .
 i thought this cb very guailan that time say she &apos;s still very very rich when people want to cancel her ?
 ask her go buy a farking condo la .
 complain so much for what ccb
 fuck off la xiaxue ,  oredi old and irrelevant .
 so many young chio bu influencers to look at now .
 chiu mean chiu actually looked her way once ?
 as if other pap areas are very clean .
 pap beloved foreign trash neighbor oso caused my balcony ceiling to be liddat ,  can i write to wanbao to complain like this bitch
 xx generates views to her blog and pages by deliberately spreading unpopular statement and u guys just keep falling for it .
 cb this xx got prob isit .
 go tpy and see those blocks even far worse maintenance and dirty smelly void decks there  .
 and no ,  i will not click on her blog or youtube to let her earn a single cent for real me
 did not click her sites leh  .
 please post more kym .
 see her pic shorten life by 1 yr .
 can award them guinness world record liao
 their mathematical system is different from international world standard ?
 how to interpret the place value with  ,  after 2 place values ?
 the high positivity rate indicates the limiting factor is the testing capabilities ,  nothing to see here ,  nobody can know the actual numbers .
 just look back in a year and compare the excessive deaths ,  assuming they can even get that stat close to accurate lol .
 wife material definitely ,  especially the way she take the chopper chop the coconut then squeeze until all the juice cums out .
 cant tell is acting or actual nonya
 not bad ,  can double up as maid also
 like copy the cheena kampong girl one
 looks like nonya features bro .
 big butt ,  big chest ,  big eyes
 quite plump leh .
 like to piak her in her nonya costume
 wa ,  this is waifu material .
 can fap every night and not sianz
 looks like sheng dian xia &apos;s daughter
 imitating the  .
 10 cannot stand……
 very normal but i no mind .
 feed me good food can liao 
 why use mandarin song ?
 should use keroncong .
 after give birth ,  becomes dinyobu .
  &apos;before calling others  &apos;idiots &apos; ,  make sure the thread title matches the title of the article chiu quoted .
 there &apos;s was a case last time where a sinkie was charged for spitting ,  even when the person is spitting inside/into the rubbish bin .
 take note if chiu want to spit ,  spit into tissue and throw into bin is ok .
 but directly spit into the bin is still illegal and can be fined .
 st readers are still idiots if they say placing trash beside the bin is littering .
 i think key problem is people mindset is too narrow and not flexible .
 even civil servants at times  .
 he is trying to bluff chewren
 got removal of existing tank ,  new water piping rerun elec ,  redo false ceiling  .
 better get more info before taking side .
 is her pic available ?
 i think he is jhk should charge in rm but by mistake charge in sgd ?
 i am not saying did he overcharge or not ?
 i am referring to the girl &apos;s allegation that this merchant cheated her .
 where got cheat her ?
 really is simple quote high and she accepted it .
 at no point was she bluffed to pay higher later like what jover did .
 cannot say he is cheater .
 cos it is true ,  anyone can sell their service at any desired price including chiu and me when we state our expected salary when we looking for job .
 if the buyer accepted the price ,  cannot say later kena cheated .
 his company can close shop ,  every one know will not buy from him
 this is same like atb do gq say 100 for hj .
 u want u do - dont do oredi cry kena cheat cos u heard from others say hj oni 20 .
 pretty sure atb never take knife kiap yr kkb force u pay 100 for hj .
 some people like to buy things on impulse .
 chiu cannot blame anyone if chiu havent done your research and paid a higher price for the same item .
 always do your own due diligence .
 look at that face .
 install the heater oni 300 dollars
 rheem water heater less than $600 can buy leh .
 chiu go taobao buy things oso liddat .
 chiu never scroll or arrange in price ascending order and bought the expensive one .
 chiu cannot say that chiu got cheated what .
 yup ,  just like the cases of those old uncles and aunties where they buy some high price screen protectors from those ahbeng shops .
 then cry foul too .
 its very hard to say whose right or wrong when mixing moral with business lol .
 all i can say is that they are not so well informed as us here .
 boycott this shop .
 actually ,  if she finds it too expensive ,  why agree to the services n pay for it ?
 my house water heater oso spoilt for months .
 everytime turn on ,  whole house electric circuit will trip .
 my dad very thrifty in finding the lowest cost handyman
 10 atb all offer gq different price ranges for the same services .
 u can oni blame yourself if u choose the most expensive atb to go visit for gq .
 while others go find cheap one ,  or even find the same atb but pay way lesser than u paid .
 ido we see any white knights fighting for people who overpay for gq specials
 ridiculous to pay so much just for repairs
 power this one .
 can share his shop name contact ?
 i would want to engage his service .
 water heater n sink tap need change
 in the first place can they make the bins bigger size for those place they expect more trash ?
 the speed in clearing the bins is slow oso u know .
 moi unfolds and flattens out brown cardboard boxes ,  by slicing through the scotch taped areas .
 unfolded carboard boxes is jin bulky ,  man .
 rubbish bin full .
 so put beside bin .
 environmental agencies should educate on the right mindset .
 and educate people that if they put reasonable effort to toss their litter in a bin but cannot as the bins are full ,  it is not their fault and should not be faulted .
 the people to be fault are those who organize the bins in the area .
 it is tiem to stop gaslighting to make it everytiem public &apos;s fault when it is actually govt &apos;s fault .
 this idiot knows no bounds .
 house got rubbish chute but still bring rubbish down to level 1 throw in public rubbish bin  
 geraldine soo thinks spending her time writing this solves problems  .
 instead it creates more problems for everyone .
 from sinkies fined for littering to nea to the cleaners .
 typical sinkies  .
 makes things worse for everybody
 then when full stack on top of the bin ?
 it &apos;ll be funny if stack too high and the whole bin topple over  .
 and animals rummage and scatter trash in 200 metres radius
 cos town council saves costs by employing oni few cleaners in charge of per few blocks .
 while your tc fees increases every year .
 came across this old news .
 the general local out there is a retard when it comes to such things .
 wa even mods oso call out g0ngkias ah .
 not bad not bad
 play stacking game lor
 i have a empty 65 &apos; tv cardboard to throw + a rotten sofa .
 then throw where ?
 families of people who died of covid at home in japan launch group to demand answers - the mainichi .
 tokyo -- relatives of coronavirus patients who died at home without the necessary medical care have established a bereaved families &apos; association to ex .
 keep the good things to yourself .
 this kind of friend dont bother recommending anything .
 the recent flooding jin jialat leh ,  weather there getting really extreme le
 they stopped giving passports to their people and they desperately esp the brightest try to get out ,  and chiu want to go in to be harvested ?
 not as rosy as chiu think .
 tier 1 city as expensive as singapore .
 oso housing is as expensive as our hdb .
 like jipun ,  good to visit not good to stay
 u even read the prerequisites ?
 they want highly skilled overseas chinese .
 not the ah mao ah gao that cannot even survive in their own countries
 that will be 30-60 years later for the edmwers here .
 by then cheena could oredi be more expensive than what it is today .
 maybe can try kelantan or terengganu area .
 these places 50 years wont change .
 at most change political party every election but the same    still applies
 xiamen is like singapore ,  more than 50% not local .
 but it was once voted cleanest city in china
 cheena has been flooding for 2 , 000 years .
 all the emperors had to deal with this problem .
 tier 1 = too expensive .
 tier 3 = chiu die of poisoning ,  whether natural or man-made .
 tier 2 = highest risk of scams and what not .
 but if chiu are smart enough ,  ok it is fine .
 note if chiu intend to retire there ,  chiu cannot communicate except via wechat ok .
 prolly ts fell for ccp propaganda ?
 living costs in first tier modern (similar to singapore) cities are not low .
 in fact ,  for shanghai and beijing ,  the cost of living are much much higher compared to singapore .
 when chiu say living cost is low ,  chiu would have meant very backwards rural areas ,  without modern amenities .
 chiu sure that chiu can adapt to such living conditions ?
 most ahtiong trying to leave but chiu want go in
 i visited fuzhou .
 thats clean able to rival singapore and got the taiwan vibes to this city .
 my grandparents came from fuzhou .
 it’s ok to retire there as long as chiu .
 - dont move your assets there .
 - cover up your conscience if the situation arise
 taiwan is pretty laid back and slow in the countryside .
 nothing much happening there .
 tell pm lee go live tv take modena again
 nothing to do with which vaccine for me actually ,  i chose the vaccination centre ,  not the vaccine .
 always follow pinky .
 i took moderna .
 oni slight fever for 1st jab but arm aching last longer for 2nd jab .
 no fatigue ,  tiredness ,  lethargic feeling at all .
 thats normal for both vaccines ,  so no difference .
 depends more on your age than vaccine type .
 tiagong if jab both next time chewren will become teenage mutant ninja turtle

 when chiu book appointment ,  chiu book the two appts together .
 chiu have to stick to the appointments what !
 chiu think this is your grandpa policy ah ,  can dont go for the assigned timeslots and venue meh ?
 if take moderna ,  8 weeks rater then take 2nd jab  ?
 cos side effects stronger .
 heard from colleague who is front line worker too .
 experience compared between my mom (pfizer) and my aunt (moderna) .
 my mom said pfizer sore arms hard to sleep .
 my aunt first shot no effects .
 2nd shot all the side effects (sore arm ,  chill ,  headache etc etc)
 now both 6 weeks apart
 i prefer germans  .
 dont like americans
 diana ser took moderna .
 take liao will become like this  .
 alrdy took 1st jab of retrona .
 i scared mah ,  i prefer take pfizer take moderna i oso dunno what will happen ,  i see the gahment let old people and kids oni take pfizer so i oso take lor what the diff ,  wait 2 more weeks for peace of mind oni .
 i taking moderna .
 got so many slots ,  but 2nd shot still need to wait 6wks .
 they should allow moderna takers to take 2nd shot after 4wks .
 lee hsien loong took pfizer ,  i oni follow him
 tisgong moderna is banana .
 serious ,  how to wash this kind of pot har ?
 bought a few of these kind of mini cookpots from taobao as i thought it would be convenient to cook rather than washing pot but after eating ,  i realise it &apos;s very hard to wash especially if it &apos;s oily like after eating mala soup .
 i tried to wash with soap and water and some of the water just flow down the power socket ,  when i use it after ,  it just trip the house electricity and cannot turn on after that .
 look for the variant where it has a inner pot that u can take out and wash .
 similar to rice cooker
 put water ,  boil ,  chopstick with kitchen towel to wipe clean .
 wheres the power sockets ?
 just makes sures waters duns flows theres la 
 i suppose the inner pot can be removed and wash
 pour vinegar ,  settle overnight
 make sure water dont get into socket

 insights of an interracial couple .
 160th propaganda yawnss
 main point being: don’t hyperventilate over ceca delta imports .
 when that’s the root cause of the current wave in the first place
 who cares about what she says ?
 is she an elected mp or gahment officier ?
 she is nothing ,  so why should we listen to anything she says ?
 pattern come out .
 import numbers no need anymore .
 agree ,  the daily numbers are meaningless now .
 its oni there so that edmwers can +1 with their wlwlsdwl post .
 vaccination is the oni  &apos;solution &apos; they &apos;ve got .
 can earn $$$ in their vested interest +  &apos;facilitate &apos; many more beloved delta forces to cum in .
 then tracetogether oso no need la .
 her daily tweets are what got me through each day of covid hell
 come on ,  are chiu going to deny the oni hobby we have .
 can non flu vax dine in ?
 dont worry we will still get steady stream of ceca coming here .
 our target audience
 why is she still taking .
 she gonna be the female version of cc  ?
 mai liddat lei ,  later other countries don’t want let us in wor cause we too suspicious liao  
 she could be overseeing the mtf and probably pap for all we know .
 she &apos;s just paving the way to shove all the infection counts under the carpet .
 no transparency so that the citizens and the world doesnt know how badly infected singapore is and how it is managing the spread .
 until covid and its variants are stabilised ,  i dont think its time to withold information yet .
 there are still new variants coming in and there are still new clusters forming .
 so it &apos;s back to being  &apos;just a flu &apos; ?
 even if delta plus arrives and kills many ,  the sheep wouldnt know .
 profits above people .
 that is the pap
 we can dont care what she say ,  but her husband will most likely listen to her .
 and this is going to affect us .
 stop the count !

 lol post #1 got warning .
 hopefully mods can issue more warnings to other threads .
 they can continue to fine .
 nobody will be civil minded ,  just scared of the fines .
 anyway we are on the road to no return ,  this gahment loves their quick  &apos;fine &apos; fixes cos they are basically incompetent baffoons .
 the attitude these days is ,  dustbin full ,  nevermind ,  just find a spot to squeeze ,  as long as the rubbish dont drop to the floor ,  dangle there oso ok ,  no fine so who the fiak cares .
 kanchiong people deserve to be cheated .
 just change name lor
 chiu mean the plumber held a knife at the single mom ?

 ya ,  he can close the business and then register another business the next day .
 and continue to do his business and laughing all the way to the bank .
 while u can still typing away on your keyboard and suck your thumb .
 some idiots here said the receipt is manipulated
 this guy season veterans
 it is definitely very very true that the price is really exorbitant but the lady is partly to be blamed for not getting at least 3 quotes .
 or the minimum search through the internet ,  ask friend ,  colleagues ,  relatives ,  etc before confirming  to get the water heater installed .
 to me ,  she deserves to pay this amount for her stupidity and a very expensive lesson to her .
 nobody deserves to be cheated .
 why she never google before paying ?
 pay liao then google quite dumb isnt it
 if $3350 ,  then after have 100 customers then have a lucky draw .
 winner will get $10k ,  this business model can ?
 how is this a cheating case ?
 cai png sell 10 stalls different pricing .
 u chose to buy from the most expensive one fro same ingredients n items .
 so is cai png stall cheat u ?
 i thought ladies like to compare prices ?
 what is the fair market price including installation ?
 likewise for those difficult to get new lolex .
 u cannot get from ad .
 u go find gray .
 100 gray shops selling different pricing ,  u chose to go with the most expensive one .
 same rolex ad rrp 10k ,  u buy from gray at 28k .
 can complain cheating oso ?
 can call police ?
 i think cny price hike is part of the factors ba  .
 my hair dresser up 10 dollars from usual 18 dollars  .
 plus the contractor use  &apos;star rate  &apos; to charge  .
 meaning emergencies rate ::
 cheating is pay for item or service ,  never get .
 paying way too expensive for item or service i dunno y people call as cheating .
 do business must be honest .
 if he really out to chop carrot then he is cunning .
 whether he got chop people carrot ,  oni he himself know .

  now become movie
 they should just released it in its original language .
 no one else watching ?
 singapore dont have canto version ?
 what is the point if it is not in cantonese  !
 can classified it as a foreign language movie or not  ?
 this is the best we can get to unless bukit timah which may not have the effect/wait for dvd/go over malaysia to watch
 unfortunately ,  this is a movie that must be watch in a cinema .
 the distributor should do something about it if they want to make some money .
 stop scolding him ,  he got forced out la .
 imagine your boss force u to resign and then your colleagues and family members scold u chao quitter .
 pm can still stay on as sm to guide the new pm .
 the role of hsk in his current appointment oso involves directing the future economy  .
 i feel there’s a possibility that pm probably hold the appointment a bit long
 definitely not true .
 if forced out then he wont currently hold 1st assistant secretary general role already
 personal ex-lawyer is over 60s but still not too old .

 why suddenly heng &apos;s runway kena stolen ?
 cos covid no timeframe .
 succession planning usually involve a timeframe and date
 slipperman got longer runway .
 then please tell me otherwise ?
 if succession planning has no timeframe and no date then what it is ?
 what a difference 2 years make hor .
 thats why me thinks something is not right .
 due to covid he foresee to takeover oni at 65 .
 so technically is 58 vs 65
 oic ,  then who is orr yew tang leh  ?
 yes ,  some kind of chain reaction .
 ncm kena voted can still hold on to ntuc .
 they wanna do what ,  chiu have a say meh ?
 who will be so stupid to give up the given chance to becums the prime minister of singapore should be allowed to become a pm too then .
 think about it !
 they can say all they like .
 all i know is that he did not reach 60yo overnight .
 tiagong is lack of foresight
 i feel something is very wrong internally in pap when all they can come up with is a silly excuse like this .
 heng ge and parliament performance cmi .
 will be a liability to pap
 moi will never move to tiongland  
 just rent apartment .
 and move to other city when bored .
 what are the requirements ?
 u live in west cheena then low cost lor
 stay in countryside…… .
 travel to taipei very fast de…… .
 somemore cars are cheap… .
 ya ,  alot of bad things can happen to chiu .
 if chiu move to very rural little poor village ,  your singapore middle class wealth = very rich to them .
 those unsavory characters might rob or kidnap chiu .
 can watch paint dry .
 very good for mental health .
 taiwan seems to have a good balance of freedom and nice places to visit ,  the people there are oso not as uptight as cheena where the ccp wants people to tell on each other and they will do that for social credit points
 cheena will conquer taiwan before xi retires ,  chiu do not want to be there for the next 10 to 20  years .
 if he cannot conquer ,  he will nuke it until it is dead .
 just like the same for japan .
 cheena  &apos;living cost is low &apos; what a miserable imagination .
 anyway after commie virus stabilized and can go travel ,  chiu can just travel there to eat and stay to try .
 i can tell chiu their food cost the same or higher than singapore if chiu eat outside .
 oh yes ,  the moment that happens and once ccp get ousted ,  then maybe can start to consider going to china
 still a bad idea if go there alone  .
 get murdered oso no one knows
 go there for short term less than 1 year .
 by then the 3 gorges dam oredi collapse and flush out cheena .
 all property become dirt
 migrate to stay in a tier 5 place in cheena .
 middle of taklamakan desert .
 no crowded neighbourhood .
 stay as long as chiu want .
 erm ,  how difference is this from pr ?
 going by your theory ,  might as well migrate to japan better .
 the facilities are more advanced and the culture and manners of the people are better oso .
 why would chiu retire to a place with no right of abode ?
 that sounds like stressful madness to me .
 about 2 decades late .
 china &apos;s rich coming here to singapore to retire .
 cost of living in sh ,  bj ,  hz etc look it up .
 normal sinkie sell hdb extract cpf go there ,  is worse than their street cleaners .
 sianz ,  my ns unit asked me to take the vaccine faster .
 bo bian ,  i choose moderna .
 i will go for moderna vaccination on next week .
 i somehow scared of the needle oni .
 took 1st dose of moderna in june ,  as there were no choices .
 so far no var  .
 2nd dose in 28 days .
 tiagong moderna side effect more stronk ?
 lol at those follow politicians ,  i follow dr fauzi ,  he took moderna
 some people look at quantity ,  pf is 30mcg and moderna is 100mcg .
 it stands to reason logically that moderna can give 3x stronger side effects .
 means kukujiao can grow 3x the length ah
 i oni take what the us president is taking - cant go wrong .
 my time moderna oni 4 centers offered and all freaking far from my place ,  just take pfeizer loh ,  dunnid to think too hard .
 i got a package from us shipped via ezbuy’s ship-for-me forwarding service  .
 package was due to arrive 25 jan and then on 26 jan there was a tag beside the date saying it is delayed due to subject to customs check ,  until now no news .
 it’s just 2 cables ,  if it matters .
 it’s not just ezbuy  .
 i got a package from japan shipped via ups ,  from tracking was to be delivered by the end of the day of 27 jan ,  evening time the tracking status turned into delayed without any specific reason  .
 on 28 jan night tracking showed to be delivered by the end of the day of 29 jan ,  but in the afternoon the tracking status turned into delayed again without any specific reason .
 it’s a pair of speaker stands ,  if it matters .
 anyone else having issues with shipping for your parcel around this time ?
 shopi/razada cheena packages oso delayed until cannot .
 last time wait 1+ week come alrdy .
 now 2 weeks liao still no sound no pikture
 custom checks is random one ,  i got it before in the past oso .
 but there is a delay in shipments as compared to last time is correct .
 bought items from amazon us and amazon japan .
 us delayed by 1 .
 not surprised during this period of time
 cny period in cheena is like a long break for them .
 delivery is dead until feb 8 .
 heng i shipped out early .
 local takeover of last mile delivery from cheena was friday
 my rule of thumb is ,  cheena 1 week before ,  all the way until 15 days ,  no need to even place order for anything from there .
 but i didn’t buy from cheena  .
 1 package from us 1 package from japan ,  oso tio delay  .
 not cheena oso affected ?
 everywhere now have global logiistics issues cos of the pandemic .
 many are not aware of things happening beyond our shores .
 if a courier company has indicated the parcel as “estimated delivery: <today> ,  <today’s date> by end of day”  .
 this should mean that the parcel is oredi in s’pore ,  no ?
 i got this on 27th  .
 then on 27th night the status changed to delayed  .
 then on 28th night the status changed to be delivered by end of day of 29th ,  but on 29th late afternoon changed to delayed again  .
 and now the status changed to be delivered by end of day of 31st  .
 considering today is cny eve ,  what are the odds that it will be changed back to delayed again ?
 the tracking system might not be accurate most of the time .
 until they actually reach in singapore .
 sometimes parcel can go to a regional hq for sorting in another country before landing in singapore .
 naos chius noes thes powers of tiongs 
 i ordered a small item being shipped from cheena ,  through lazada .
 no shipping delays .
 shipped from cheena on 24 jan ,  arrived in singapore on 27 jan .
 should expect this liao
 i have one ezship from usa ,  stuck for almost 2 months oredi ,  last status  &apos;customs check &apos; .
 and its nothing special ,  just some hardware worth less than $20 (and declared correctly) .
 think the low end shipping is the most affected ,  cos i recently sent a package to usa via fedex full price ,  few hundred bucks for shipping .
 reached within days
 short of manpower .
 so they will usually push the delays onto customs .
 unless u go question customs lor .
 for chinese side ,  cny means the 2 weeks prior they start winding down and 2 weeks from start of cny .
 unless is those atas critical sector logistics
 people open cafe oso wanna politicise really a new low for these ppl
 ts ,  out of touch does not apply here  .
 at most chiu could oni say he might not have any business sense  .
 out of touch is used when people behind some policies making that affect a huge number of people  .
 do chiu think his cafe can do this ?
 from who ,  p^p or wp ?
 we can see that the opening of his café has really helped to stimulate the economy with the ibs getting income opportunities .
 sadly the one so call serving the people are lost of touch .
 fine people $300 for not returning trays .
 can hire summon officers but cannot hire more cleaners .
 go back and bark at them ba chiu
 chiu overestimated sinkies liao .
    cafes these day are for ig and social media posting .
 dont laugh die me that sinkies gather around cafes for ideas and influence .
 we are not in france .
 saw this ts regularly post anti-opp threads so many times .
 now ib dog dunnid to wait after  dinner to bark lioaz .
 so hard working .
 he should open a coffee stall instead
 ts please think of murali .
  he will give murali less trouble if his cafe is good business .
 didnt know pap supporter iq and caliber became so low
 i going orchard towers and parklane mall hunt color wolfs ,  who wan to join me .
 i oso have a similar intention but i will hunt chiu down and do wicked and evil things to chiu .
 tiagong there are more zombies than werewolves in eastern europe .
 whatsapp me the time and date .
 stupidity or lust ?
 keep trying to normalize covid and downplay it like a normal flu .
 but restrict dine-in numbers ,  discriminate against the unvaxed ,  postpone ndp .
 the words and actions dont match ,  so what is the gahment hiding ?
 this one very obvious
 sure dunnid to report .
 then nobody needs to know of any spike up in cases after all the arrival by planeloads .
 no evidence that more cases caused by foreigners incoming .
 what hc  posts ,  mostly come true ,  i wonder how come  .
 but is expected after all the rush to vax ,  var and underlying conditions nonsense
 playing with people &apos;s lives siol .
 and sinkies still fighting between vax and nonvax among themselves when the real issue is on top of them .
 as there are more and more useless papy mps ,  it is meaningless to put trust in them anymore .
 just as a normal person is considered for a job requires interview ,  papy seem to use grc to pull in friends/spouses .
 she is a nuisance
 the best part is vaccinated still need to wear mask and socially distance ,  so much for just another flu .
 if she is posting fb all day ,  who is running temasek ?
 queueing there now !
 so that even if there is a new variant ,  u will not know anyway .
 public reporting not important but bubble with other countries will still need us to submit numbers one
 if i’m tourist i won’t dare to come  .
 unless i am ceca
 no need report la ,  just tell the whole world singapore oredi covid free .
 singapore has won the battle .
 then confirm everyone will gong gong come to tour
 she dunno what is who .
 u dont report how who track and report .
 dont live in yr own world
 they would still report to who .
 it &apos;s oni the removal of the statistics from 160 msm and other channels assessable by the public .
 so indeed they still need to report .
 how to protect themselves against such things
 cancel culture cancelled her so hard ,  wp has difficulty trying to find out if she’s a real person .
 cancel culture cancelled her so hard ,  her mama got cancelled as well .
 cancel culture cancelled her so hard ,  her passport and ic read 00000000 and photo page is blank .
 sinkie ah sinkie 
 not really a misfortune .
 the antics of the likes of xx oni serve to piss voters off and show off the arrogance of the pap ,  and that turns voters off .
 yah she said she is very rich .
 rich but cannot afford to stay condo .
 must complain until face green green .
 must be sylvia know its xia xue thats why bo chup her la  .
 please keep it up .
 dunnid entertain such vermin .
 could it be why the mom had to complain for her is cos .
 house is in mom &apos;s name .
 lol respond for what ?
 she is a pap troll
 stop reading at xiaxue .
 really xia suey
 mps are not your personal facilities manager .
 too expensive too .
 try hdb or town council for your problem
 this has-been is brushing her presence again~~
 she can go stfu and move out .
 why xiaxuay so low ses stay aljunied .
 she should be staying more high ses area under pap .
 she and her family should move out of aljunied if she is unhappy .
 pap minister oso say not happy can go  .
 these issues not under hdb meh ?
 mps never replies e-mail one la .
 got one service app she got use anot ?
 why use mother to sends email on her behalf ?
 she cannot send herself meh ?
 she is at it again la ,  trying to get people to go read her blog and instagram stories to drive up traffic .
 dont be fooled .
 she banks on negative advert
 need to stir something so she remains relevant mah .
 she is trying very hard to be a ncmp
 yet again a dinosaur trying to stay relevant
  &apos;boiz ,  im not earning as much as i should in precovid times ,  time to generate more traffic .
 she trying to cancel slyvia lim ?
 i complain about pap run town council and no one hiew me
 any idea whether anyone is working over the cny holidays ?
 seems like nothing is moving .
 will they oni “clear custom” from thursday onwards ?
 mine from ezbuy with eta today .
 i see no reason pm lee need to stay to handle covid .
 he could become senior adviser to pm heng .
 the handover could be done this year or early next year when most would have been vaccinated
 not the first time they come up with silly reasons to justify things ,  msm will just run that story ,  polls will then show that sinkies  &apos;accepted those reasons &apos;
 his brother who knows him for 60+ years exposed him .
 else we wont know he is that power hungry .
 he released so many budgets until hand soft .
 then became pm ,  how to recover the money 
 it shows he &apos;s just power hungry never intend to let go his dynasty lor whats new ?
 would haf been better for hsk to say his health is deteriorating than just say suddenly too old for the job
 ah heng is a worker lai de .
 when told to work will work when told to stop will stop .
 who told him to stop ?
 here &apos;s an eerie reminder .
 nobody in the young leaders dare to plan secretly and ousted pinky meh ?
 that will truly be leadership material .
 ask to work ,  then work ,  ask too stop then stop is not leadership material .
 apparently ah heng just learned to count to 60 oni a few days ago .
 2 years ago he could oni count to 58 .
 same for all those 4g lee-ders who chose him to lee-d them .
 one rule for elites .
 another for peasants .
 actually quite straight up he had wrote in the letter .
 we just read between the lines can tell the real reason
 heng is oso quite smart and crafty to draft such an excuse with embedded multiple hints .
 as usual ,  pinky is damn stupid to take it at the face value .
 hint: age ,  by xx he &apos;ll be too old .
 just curious ,  how many carrots has he chopped oredi prior to this incident  ?
 realee kiam hoot bin
 when can we see people kpkb ntuc cheat money ?
 cos same item more expensive than ss cs giant etc ?
 singapore contractors mostly charged super expensive one .
 last time is all this pricing until internet appear .
 why do u think main contractors and developers can live in mansion
 that time mask sells 30 dollars 50 dollars oso got people buy  .
 never see people kpkp so much 
 if chiu trust this kind of ljb look ,  then u deserve to be conned  .
 if he write quotation show chiu breakdown and still $3350 ,  and chiu still sign .
 luckily i boil water ,  then pour into a large pail mixed with cold water to shower 
 this type cb merchant still dare to explain lol
 the contractor wants to buy bmw m4 ?
 never ask for pricing before installation ?
 u think everyone outta is so honest and upright ?
 can someone post the full article so that we can hear the other side of the story
 no more part time income for them ?
 saf golden rule
 eggmy really pattern more than badminton
 plus adding background music ?
 ya ,  their main city is as expensive / more expensive than singapore 
 would moi want to move to a country where ccp rules ?
 not in a million years
 if chiu have money ,  everywhere is a good place to move to .
 but on this topic ,  cheena is so big ,  it depends on where chiu go to .
 preferably if chiu can go site survey a few times before making your move .
 chiu are not wrong .
 the rich chinese coming to low tax rate singapore bringing with them loads of money while the poor edmwers want to migrate out to any other country they think is  &apos;cheap &apos; .
 i always think it &apos;s a good idea to retire in cheena .
 big land ,  low cost of living (of course not everywhere) ,  chio bu ji nang .
 as of exactly which part havent really decided yet .
 stay for a few years is ok .
 retire there is a nightmare .
 medical care is suck .
 top notch medical care is expensive .
 it is better for chiu to remain in singapore inc .
 if chiu are on a visa  ,  and do not have permanent residency or citizenship chiu are oni staying as long as the gahment allow chiu .
 u will be in for a rude shock if u think they are culturally close to us .
 what your saying dont even make sense .
 it &apos;s such a stupid idea that these people clearly never even visited before .
 will probably get cancer or lose a limb within a few years there
 sinkies are westernized in many ways .
 we are culturally closer to the western countries (usa ,  canada ,  uk) than cheena .
 there’s always the question of “how to proof chinese descent” .
 doesnt mean chiu chinese race = chinese descent to them .
 suggest chiu find the full process and requirements first .
 oh and if chiu think cheena = low cost of living ,  chiu better go visit few more times and live a bit to find out first .
 your need to show them your grandparent &apos;s or parent &apos;s old cheena passport .
 ya where to find siol .
 my grandparents all passed away .
 dont even know where is their death cert now .
 dont say passport ,  id ,  birth cert etc
 why shortern life .
 piaking is exercise for body .
 unless u mean shoot out sperm shorten life
 applying for the visa now !
 unless u are going to stay at non-tier 1 cities then yes ,  cheaper than singapore .
 else don’t even think about it .
 not against the idea ,  but freedom of speech and restricted/limited internet access plus language barrier .
 plus have to factor in chiu can die anytime or sent off to prison camps 
 bbfa will all choose invisible to taokua zhabor bathing la .
 during ns time sure want invisible man la .
 else kena ‘volunteer’ by encik
 flying oni 1 thrill .
 invisibility got many thrills
 chiu see harry potter ,  everyone can fly ,  but invisibility is rare .
 yes should loosen all restrictions liao ,  open up the country also
 after sweeping under carpet thousands of vaccine injuries ,  .
 pap going to sweep under carpet severe covid cases and deaths ,  be it vax or no vax .
 i sarpork the non-reporting of non critical cases .
 pointless liao as we move towards endemic .
 oni report severe cases
 want quarantine we comply .
 want vax we do  .
 want open economy ,  we  understand  .
 want endemic ,  we lan lan .
 but open up to ceca ,  really feel like a stab from the back .
 no ,  don’t label us as that please .
 the price to pay is too high for such returns
 if more people vaccinate: .
 open borders to delta .
 never report cases .
 more people unmasked for dining in .
 must go back office .
 schools dont close and unvaccinated children roam around .
 altogether sounds like it &apos;s better if people dont vaccinate .
 fark the c guys deal .
 ask them to do it and hug the incoming cecas .
 cnn just reported 15% hospitalisation is children under 12
 yeah sweep under carpet lor .
 dont report at all .
 or become like prc an report oni 1/10 .
 i  hope they get covid and die a horrible death .
 it’s just whether want to do or don’t do .
 don’t just treat it as flu when it’s not .
 don’t find excuses to justify .
 if they have the data we all can make decisions .
 instead they r not reporting and how will we know ?
 doesn’t mean that 0 case is 0 case but now is totally not reporting is not good at all .
 if the world all go down this path then the world is doom .
 we will see more mutation n that break through to vaccines might be earlier
 i was watching the video by namewee on securing donations for their hospital they say quite a number of children oso kena by covid hor .
 so when they open up for everything to mingle .
 the kids got to be extra careful leh .
 insert picture of lhl saying it is just like the flu .
 this fb post is maciam edmw posts; noise nia .
 flu chiu got otc medicine to help deal with the symptoms .
 usually doesnt develop into something serious .
 then how to distinguish norm and sudden surge in case of a new variant ?
 dont report if got new variant how ?
 wait until daily got 500 case then report ?
 if 500 is the norm .
 by then flag out ,  how many weeks of lapse and how many will get infected
 singapore news oredi limited .
 now still dont want to report figures .
 then what to report ?
 thats an awesome idea .
 i wont visit singapore if im from australia or cheena ,  basically any place with tight controls over covid .
 the oni people who will come are from places where situation is so bad that even unknown unreported cases are better than their hometown .
 and then we will have outbreaks cos vaccine cant stop us from getting the virus from those visitors .
 and at some point the hospitals will be stressed and we will have to go on heightened alert .
 ya i like the idea .
 on one end ,  they want to restrict our daily activities .
 on the other end ,  they are ready to mass import their cherished ft and cecas .
 ho jinx:  &apos;all these can happen when we have high vaccination rate ,  to reduce the risks of covid infection to that of a seasonal or flu or common cold .
 infectious experts agree with this oredi ?
 since its same like flu ,  then no need to wear mask .
 no social distancing .
 we go party and do mass events .
 fly to any country .
 reminds me of josephine  &apos;small spaces &apos; teo

 she is now trying to trigger and bait opposition supporters to go to her blog or insta and scold her to get her much needed traffic and view counts .
 whatever the case just dont go read her blogs or insta or whatever la if chiu dont like her .
 no traffic and view count she will slowly and surely fade out of existence .
 it has been proven many times that she will never let herself fade out of existence .
 too attention seeking liao
 she could had stayed in amk and would get more sponsorships being in pap ward and strong pap sarporker but chose to stay in hougang to dilute wp votes

 we cannot blame the retailers from selling at any price they want .
 so next time chiu queue for nasi padang behind someone who claims he got it @ 2 .
 50 ,  it doesn’t mean you’ll oso get it @ 2 .
 learn from grab surge price
 indeed thats the way to really survive .
 but then it will oso tarnish reputation .

 i really hope other countries will boycott coming to singapore and oso not make it easy for travellers from singapore to enter their country .
 so what &apos;s her vax status huh ?
 there &apos;s nothing they wont do in order to hide the fact that their vaccines are failures
 this is the correction of a downtrend ,  new variant coming next .
 your guess is as good as any
 in ancient chinese history ,  peasants are forbidden from criticising the empress dowager .
 not back to norm .
 one thing has nothing to do with the other .
 we all know this woman is rotten but this is another level
 why she always write until macam ahes in charge hah .
 luckily now is 2021 and she &apos;s not the empress dowager !
 the empress has spoken .
 want to treat covid as normal flu ?
 then dont discriminate against the unvax , dont require mask wearing , make everyone go back to office , fire all the red army .
 cannot do that ?
 then jolly well go home and ask your henpecked husband to instruct his million dollar salary minions to keep reporting the cases
 maybe unvaxx or half ?
 quite protected environments .
 not like she go strolling at malls or take public transport .
 if lhl oredi double mask when close proximity with other dignitaries .
 hahah problem is ivory towers have data .
 it &apos;s unsuspecting peasants that might die
 if im the commander .
 i will deploy troops in thousands to all heartland areas to test each and every block .
 even it means to test a dead body i will tell them to dig up .
 tie up loose ends then open up border .

 if really test i bet we got our own sinkie strain .
 clean community case
 can tell like dat meh ?
 tiagong hang tt token around your neck 24/7 ,  covid dont dare disturb u .

 but u dont want to dirty yourself ,  then how ?
 quickly run to nearest grass patch .
 ask them lay a ground sheet first .
 it is like you &apos;ve been brainwash by western media liao .
 i &apos;ve been to cheena quite frequently ,  this kind of thing do not happen there unless chiu work on something against the gahment .
 not after age 60 .
 can share where chiu got the info from ?
 maybe i brain wash or not ,  but those kill/prison camp does happen ,  right ?
 which part of cheena ?
 cheena oni tier 1 cities got comparable standard of living with singapore ,  even their tier 2 cities are not that great .
 everything from food ,  water to healthcare are sub par .
 oni housing (if chiu rent) and cars are much cheaper in cheena .
 never been there ,  but thats quite an ulu place isnt it ?
 it &apos;s better than your imagination .
 the city is quite well build .
 people are very civilize .
 girls are pretty !
 ts u really something wrong  .
 many ahtiong trying to escape and migrate and chiu want to stay there .
 500 yen is 7 bucks u know right ?
 got money to spend no need to work meh .
 u will see alot of people going back to cheena in the nearly future .
 my relative working in suzhou .
 medical system singapore is better .
 tier 1 private is very expensive
 buys a holidays house there then stay few month song song then come back home to singapore lor .
 ts ,   &apos;after retired &apos; is uplorry  .
 moi wan to retire in chiangmai .
 taiwan is a much better place if you &apos;re looking to retire .
 it &apos;ll feel distinctly chinese but still have some feel of western or japanese .
 cultural gap not as big .
 thought of it before .
 i like the 4 seasons .
 but i have to make sure the place dont have natural disasters like prone to earthquake ,  floods etc .
 cheena is so big sure have places where it is safe .
 chiu think chiu culturally closer to angmo ,  but the angmo dont think so leh .
 they think chiu are there oni for their pleasure .
 as more and more people in singapore gets infected into the thousands (daily new cases) ,  and maybe more ,  the chances that a new covid mutation might occur in singapore patients that becomes a new distinct variant is not impossible .
 maybe it is oredi happening ,  maybe not ,  maybe it wont happen at all .
 but if many enough are infected and the numbers explode too sharply ,  we might see a new singapore covid variant in the midst of our 5 .
 7 million population .
 i am not an  &apos;expert &apos; ,  i am not a virologist or medically trained .
 i am not fear-mongering .
 im just predicting a worse case scenario ,  if our covid cases keeps rising out of control ,  at this rate ,  with so many irresponsible people underestimating the virus and letting their guards down ,  it might become inevitable .
 but let &apos;s hope for the best .
  all the best .
 please do meet the mp session more to build confidence level on the ground leh
 there is no talent in singapore inc .
 so ,  it is impossible to create a variant since there is no talent in the virus too .
 no leh ,  chiu know india tio how many( and that’s oni counting those who were detected) before they produce a variant ?
 must look at countries that produces a variant and the number of people who tio to produce one variant .
 singapore cases by absolute numbers might be still too little to produce a variant .
 is called mutate .
    half past six vaccine oni create more mutation into different virus .
 ah finally something we can b proud  of  .
 sorry to dash your hopes .
 our population is too small  .
 to create a ripple effect across the world .
 one should never underestimate this covid virus ,  it has oredi surprised many world renowed medical and virus experts .
 chiu never know how much is the exact threshold it requires to mutate into a distinct variant .
 but as i said ,  let &apos;s hope it wont happen in singapore .
 thought india last time say got singapore variant liao
 that was rubbish fake news .
 but i am predicting maybe it could eventually happen in singapore .
 but i oso hope it wont happen .
 chiu could possibly be right .
 or chiu could be wrong .
 forum has implemented special functions that lets chiu bump the thread up if chiu are right and lets chiu abandon thread if you &apos;re wrong .
 i oso say so and this sinkie variant will render mrna vaccines useless
 mutations are random ,  so it &apos;s really hard to speculate .
 but with 80% vaxxed and transmissions still raging like fire ,  the positive selective pressure on the virus will be present .
 no tens over thousands confirmed cases no homemade variants .
 chiu see those countries that churned out variants .
 they single day oso must smelly smelly  have tens of thousands of confirmed cases .
 if sinkieland really attained tens of thousands conformed cases per day .
 oso will not have homemade variants too .
 cos within 3-6 months whole .
 country achieved herd immunity liao .
 sometimes sinkies forget that we are quite irrelevant to the rest of the world
 what will be the name of this local variant ?
 surely will have .
 but the strain will be like sinkies .
 it &apos;s be called sg-1 .
 or sinkie-1 variant
 this variant may well be one resistant to pfizer and moderna vaccines ,  as singapore has the highest vaccination rate in the world of over 80+% .
 highest vaccinated country run the highest risk of being the incubator for the evolution of the next deadliest variant .
 1337 today opened leow
 in before @busfreaks
 with @petcat @petdog @petmouse  ?
 i want toto number for tomorrow
 where is @jiakliaobee charsiew and @ramlee
 inside store is long toilet better .
 this 1 square or rectangular anyhow fit install the urinal
 the one at bedok ?
 or actually most petrol station toilets are liddat ?
 ya anyhow fit install the urinal .
 got other stations oso like that
 can pee n wash hand at e same time
 look like sinopec bukit timah
 chiu need a big place like girl toilet that 3 or 4 guys can go inside and gossip ?
 i oni been to a few so cant confirm lol
 very familiar toilet .
 i pang jio at this urinal .
 then i control and save some urine in my bladder .
 wait for u to come n wash your hands at the sink .
 then when u wash your hands that time ,  .
 i turn around and spray my urine at u
 been to a few is enough .
 means not oni 1 station is like that
 stupidest design ever
 been to one esso in cck like this layout one .
 open door can see the guy pang dio
 can urine at basin and wash hand at urinal .
 opposite holland v one is it ?
 esso oso liddat ,  seen before
 i oni have 2 question .
 got smell and got poop flooting in the toilet bowl ?
 if dont have then next time i know where to go when need to use public toilet in singapore  
 this is esso right ?
 if chiu can stand at the place chiu took the picture ,  im sure another person can stand in front of chiu to pang jio while chiu wash hands
 158 oni interview the plumber boss ?
 why never interview other plumbing companies run by local chinese boss to check if this is market rate ?
 liddat the report will be balanced mah .
 he like sl shop ,  will overcharge plus misc cost here and there after finishing work .
 his reason that need to go to bb to geylang to look for heater so it cost more is csb .
 he doesnt have stock and need to go so far to look is after she agreed to paying .
 they wont say its over one .
 even if find one that says is over ,  then contractor can say that the item and type of job done is different .
 say he not evil merchant .
 might as well say he look like david beckham .
 3350 and lay toilet wall and floor tiles for 1 toilet oredi .
 chiu mean chiu believe ,  for a single second ,  that this 3350 is market price meh ?
 3350 can hire 3 banglas for 3 months maybe still got change .
 but why the lady oni kpkb after job done and invoice paid ?
 the 3350 figure if really so unacceptable ,  she should bang table when the boss quoted her the material and labour costs .
 unless she just wanted to fast hand fast leg solve the problem and never clarify the price .
 moi pay a urgent plumbing job to fix my water basin leaking with replacement of a small pipe ring on sunday night oso $220 .
 i actually trust bangalas more .

 thanks for sharing
 if they employ unlicenced workers ,  good luck to him .
 knn s$1k can get the best storage water heater from shops all over singapore liao .
 simi cny need additional charges ,  changing water pipe and run all over singapore from toh guan to bt batok and finally found it in geylang are all talking cock ,  just want to cheat uneducated woman .
 lulz very ex but at least is working   .
 peasants pay $millions for lemons in white  
 sinkie so daft thats why they are easily pwn by the gahment .
 condo or landed pricing ?
 common sense sld know it &apos;s expensive .
 sinkie pwn sinkie 
 no matter how chiu look at it ,  it is still anot simple price to charge
 a tech company set up their headquarter office in singapore ?
 does that mean the company will be on the way to be tok gong soon one day ?
 means more jobs for ft .
 sinkies still do grabfood  
 most probably wanting to expand into apac market then house their c-suites here
 if still headcount all ft or own village no sinkies who cares right ?
 but if is a cheena company wont have special village liao right ?
 it’s in her genes .
 her mum is pretty
 mmmm her mother
 is not bad look
 mom looks good .
 this one n that yip ping xiu r pap cronies lai de !
 rich family ,  can let her ride horse .
 couldnt bring myself to watch this paralympia   .
 daughter not ok .
 i know her sis .
 cute cats in the video
 is a fish soup stall ?
 i wonder the kfc still can open on 10th or nt .
 the menu looks like so~
 a fire extinguisher could have prevented this fire from engulfing the whole kopi tiam .
 i am surprised the whole kopi tiam dont even equip one or scdf mandate to do so .
 in  countries like japan/taiwan ,   fire extinguisher is everywhere
 the decor looks like brand new ,  the owner of the kopitiam sure loogi .
 no fre extinguisher
 ah gong telling his son not to open leg so fast
 no fire extinguisher to put off first  ?
 mebbe heaven/hell telling amy notch to push people to be hawker .
 all thish is signs .
 no safety briefing every morning ,  thats why like that
 the singapore civil defence force (scdf) said it was alerted to the fire at about 2 .
 15pm ,  and arrived to find that contents of the coffee shop were  &apos;well alight &apos; .
 should be ablaze bah ?
 well alight sounds like what people would write to coat bitter pill .
 no duty of care .
 insurance can dont pay right ?
 no fire extinguisher ?
 nobody know how to use ?
 never throw water at kitchen fires ,  as almost all kitchen fires are burning oil ,  chiu pour water the flaming oil floats on water and you &apos;ll get a fire that is spread even wider due to your water flowing everywhere bringing along the fiery oil with it .
 either use fire extinguisher or get something that is not flammable to douse the fire instead
 no fire extinguisher  .
 all really just see show from far sia .
 who is liable for the damage ?
 meaning no test no case on a whole new level~~
 has the ministries ran out of spokesperson ?
 or they find it better to get a  &apos;non-political &apos; figure to post so that if their is any public backlash ,  no one can pin it on gahment bodies ?
 when is covid the same as flu ?
 chiu can ask any scientists in the world and 99% will tell chiu that they are not the same .
 1% are those dr leong and fish dude gahment mouthpiece .
 covid vs flu lol .
 flu is almost extinct with mask wearing .
 covid can still spread with mask on thats the difference .
 to compare flu with covid is delusional
 it becomes quite meaningless to pay the ministers if they cant solve the issue either
 if we go by this logic ,  those who got flu like symptoms need to report  ?
 close contact need to qo ?
 numbers too humiliating then say numbers are meaningless .
 that really solved the problem .
 no need to report to domestic audience ,  but is there a requirement to report to gisaid for global tracking ?
 opening up means many delta swarming in .
 chiu cant be reporting stats like today cos it will show increasing number of imported cases ,  and daily new communities cases will go into hundreds and thousands .
 with such stats ,  many countries will issue travel bans and votes will be lost .
 anyway ,  did who give permission not to report stats  ?
 i think people have the right to know how bad the situation .
 if i’m old ,  or sick or with underlying condition ,  i need to know whether i’m safe to go out .
 even vaccinated people can die cos of covid .
 at least we have choice how to protect ourself .
 no ,  she is not but more powder full than the minister .
 dont think there &apos;s a country in the world which doesnt report cases .
 at worse ,  they fake it .
 hc is disturbingly out of control .
 not going to accept that .
 if they dont want to report or emphasis about it too much in daily news ,  that is fine .
 constantly feeding negativity into the public is notch exactly healthy over the long term anyway .
 but if they dont track it and place data in accessible gahment data sources ,  it is not .
 even the yolo mode uk tracked and display the data openly .
 in fact they even tracked the number of tests done(could not find that data in our moh daily report) .
 with the data available we can compare .
 severe illness and icu .
 tests numbers(not actively reported in singapore  which is in fact very important) .
 by knowing all the numbers we derive very important data about .
 the number of severe illness being caused by high cases load ,  or if the cases load is low ,  the severity of the nature of the virus would have increased significantly ,  or maybe virus massively breaking through resistances/vaccines etc .
 oso if there is a very low number of cases ,  is it caused by no test = no case = dont worry be happy ?
 or did the covid somehow became evasive enough to evade tests .
 is can oso compare death rate with severe illness ,  whether death rate spike among elderly or even the younger population group ?
 or whether cases spike among younger pop instead of older etc .
 covid is not over yet .
 the rest of the world had not manage it well yet .
 not reporting these data is a big red flag ,  or even a death flag .
 so smart then lets become indonesia(initial stage lor) ,  what chiu dunno ,  dont hurt chiu .
 dont vaccine lor .
 singapore gahment wants to hide more things from its citizen ,  the tranny of pap gahment is getting worse even since lky pass away .
 i fear singapore will become a fail state in the coming years ahead .
 india investments buay tong liao must import
 out of sight ,  out of mind ?

 stand close behind look over his shoulder and keep saying  &apos;ka kin leh bro &apos;
 wont be surprised .
 we always gold standard then weeks after become sh1t standard
 my thoughts too .
 lol another bullsheet uneducated layman guess      .
 chiu so smart but aint no virologist la !
 variant is the product of an unvaccinated population ,  not when the majority are vaccinated .
 correct chiu before chiu anyohow sprout rubbish    
 almost every other sea country has higher covid numbers than singapore ,  and in far larger populations .
 we haven’t seen an indonesian variant or philippine variant and chiu want to predict a singapore variant ?
 chiu are not an expert ,  virologist .
 i suspect if chiu are even educated .
 that armpit is ku rut ku rut .
 tell her come sinkieland work in dome 3 better
 i wanna fry her .
 no pong kitchen no talk
 no tiktok no talk
 need remove make up first .
 the quality of food is generally better
 living cost is low ?
 chiu must be kidding .
 unless chiu are referring to third tier cities and below .
 even second tier cities are catching up in terms of living expenses .
 that’s cos you’re there for max 7 days not 7 months .
 2 things that suck big time in cheena .
 the internet annoys me no end .
 constant fight between the vpn and their firewall .
 and watch what chiu say ,  ccp is none of your business .
 medical sucks big time .
 i visited their 2jia hospital and it looked like an abattoir with blood flowing on corridor .
 ok some injured guys probably just got sent in when i was there but still it was horrifying .
 their best hospitals are damn busy and not cheap for foreigners .
 actually u go there mind your own business it’s a nice place to stay .
 things are so cheap .
 many beautiful and historical cities to tour ,  just take their speed train reach within few hrs .
 at least u know won’t tio racism .
 not to forget ,  their firewall is exceptionally robust around 4th june and golden week .
 most vpns if not all will fail .
 liddat i want to go back to my grandfather and father hometown in cheena .
 wonder if i can still find my way to that village in the ulu ulu area of canton province and meet up with any relatives of my level .
 if can find ,  will definitely want to stay there for few years to experience the life of my ancestors .
 taipei is my favourite asian city .
 what about tier 2 or 3 cities
 try getting the visa first .
 i dont even know if i can get my late great grandparents &apos; birth cert proving they were born in cheena and my late grandparents &apos; birth cert stating that they are children of my great grandparents .
 thats oni if chiu live in tier 3/4 cities which are boring as hell .
 there &apos;s literally no reason to retire there .
 u should actually if your young .
 travel not just to cheena but the world for a bit .
 u will appreciate small things such as in singapore your tap water can drink straight ,  your traffic lights work ,  take cab no potholes on road give u concussion ,  etc .
 it will give u perspectives
 this is old news leh 2018
 tier 2 cities hit the sweet spot .
 cost of living is slightly cheaper than singapore with an abundance of things to do .
 tier 3 cities are cheaper but they are boring .
 chiu cant stay there for longer than a week and not want to travel out .
 they have so many completed projects left empty or less than 10% occupancy .
 many developers are going bust in domestic market thats why cheena one belt policy is so provide more stimulus to its construction industry by getting overseas infrastructure projects in the pretext of offering loans and  &apos;helping &apos; less developed countries
 have chiu been to xiamen ?
 yunnan is really shangrila .
 maybe chengdu hangzhou if you’re willing to pay more .
 even in a big city ,  if chiu stay  in an outskirt neighbourhood ,  everything is much cheaper .
 i don’t know what you’re looking for but there are hundreds of chinese cities that are really nice .
 there are folks who are even willing to retire in jb which is one of the most boring places on earth .
 any tier 3 chinese cities will be better .

 [gvgt] “it pains me greatly ,  but to me ,  beyond anything else ,  it’s important to be truthful to my country &apos; - wp aide loh pei ying​ .
 at the end of her second day before the committee ,  ms loh asked for a chance to give a personal statement .
 she said she had been a wp member for 10 years and had given its cause her personal time and youth ,  in case anyone thought she had come before the committee with any agenda .
 “i’m very aware of the ramifications of what i’ve shared ,  including these whatsapp conversations , ” she said ,  tearing up .
 “it pains me greatly ,  but to me ,  beyond anything else ,  it’s important to be truthful to my country .

 this dino bu 30 yo but looks like late 40s overweight auntie .
 no wonder they chose chio bu tan chen chen ,  nicole instead of her
 very sad to hear that seriously .
 especially still consider cny period .
 there is no case for this incident even u go court as it is a willing buyer and willing seller at agreed price .
 the buyer never do due diligence to protect ownself ,   it is own mistake .
 i tio this type of case before .
 this is exactly what i was told。unless there is some element of misrepresent that can be proven
 i am a part time handyman and have installed this kind of heater before .
 the heater itself at most $350 .
 it is not difficult to install if it is not concealed in false ceiling .
 even one man can do the job but i usually using two men .
 as removing the old heater is more jialat than putting up new one .
 it is not easy to fully drain the water and hence it is quite heavy to remove .
 if chiu are replacing with the same model ,  no piping works required  ,  other than fixing back .
 if the model is diff ,  new pipe bends are required .
 more than 2k is considered very very ex .
 don’t unds how the contractor charge at this price oso .
 if wanna chop roberto maybe quote 1k still can try ,  i thought this 3k is too much .
 plumber electrician mechanic 99% overcharged l
 sometimes do business oso difficult la .
 if say cny no open for business ,  but this cb customer keep pestering must come do dont care ,  then chiu delibrately quote a super expensive price to put the customer off ,  end up the customer still say ok please do ,  how ?
 and then after that ll still see the customer complain oh too expensive i have been con ,  sibei jialat .
 how much u change for water tap ?
 yes ,  everything diy ,  is free of labour charge ,  just need to spend time ,  buy the tools needed to diy ,  and then when no use the tools just keep in storeroom ,  no storage charge ,  free
 huai case no help her ?
 joven is low ses brand ,  right ?
 i am doing part time  ,  changing water tap around $30-50 depends on location .
 when i am doing full time i need at least $50 .
 long run really got save money using heat pump aos ?
 load of nonsense
 3350 can lay good quality vinyl flooring + screeding for a 3room flat or a system 3 mitsubishi aircon liao
 just like ib say they not ib clone say they not clone .
 and this jamie now then complain lol .
 just what kind of heater including installation will cost $2500  .
 hope singapore inc dont let their own down .
 but ,  it is too much to ask when we dont even have any money for a badminton world champion  ?
 no wonder he see no point in winning it any more .
 read liao damn sad man
 come on la chiu will never see such thing happen to singapore athlete
 how come tio disregard until liddat ?
 not say to give her an ultimate wealth or anythin &apos; but should have some kind of support at least from the sports ministry or any related org
 no have 1 mil meh ?
 they never get enough sponsors for it .
 so ,  what is the point of him winning again  ?
 waste more time from training on all the meaningless wayang  ?
 if chiu read further down below the page in the link .
 last year ,  39-year-old former national sprinter raduan emeari was found to be working at a petrol station in kuala selangor
 msia and cheena athletes all very chiam
 ask jib gor n lao mah what he intend to do about it .
 seriously ,  chiu should go and take a look at lin dan &apos;s house .
 china &apos;s athletes are covered by their nation &apos;s funds .
 paid very well .
 sad to read such news .
 bummers like osaka ,  biles got paid millions of dollars but so many lesser champs got peanuts
 due to the commercial deals ,  dont think ccp provide for them ,  so many gold medalists ,  the oni ones that matters is those who can win more .
 this one prove  .
 dont waste your time and effort training for sports  .
 granted this person has disability  .
 and even studying might not uplift her .
 there are many more examples of national players/athletes who found themselves unmarketable after a whole life dedicated to the pursuit of that 1 second less or 1 cm higher .
 if these people had put their perseverance ,  effort ,  commitment and focus on any other specialist role or technical role ,  they will easily excel and have a marketable skill .
 earned more money and is more employable than being faster that 1 second
 noone gibe a sh !
 t abt paralypic  .
 shouldnt have many advertisers find them  ?
 not all the medalists lived rich .
 got read of those medalists  .
 sell the medal or pedal the medal and live on the street asking for donation oso .
 all depend on luck ,  connection and looks as with all other things
 if chiu win and is in your glory days ,  all those bloodsuckers rush to airport fetch chiu ,  take selfies ,  write jin poetic stuffs on social media and simi lanjiao .

 finally her quarantine finished .
 at least is sporty type .
 willing to sweat with chiu .
 her figure is top quality please .
 best in jb and some say batam
 the kids heck care , their parents heck care .
 every day after work i pass by the playground , there are many kids playing and screaming with each other with mask off .
 while their caregivers sit at the benches and talk to each other with mask at their chin as well .
 it worries me why she is so vocal while some people who are in elected office are so quiet
 at times it is better not to speak n shutdown your thoughts for good .
 i think enough people report her fb acct it will be closed
 then best is people die oso no need report .
 next will she say that getting infected is beneficial for the vaccinated ?
 so more people vaccinated means dunnid to report new covid case ?
 what logic is this ?
 she completely described chiu as stupiak cos show chiu figures oso chiu wont understand !
 up for hc fanboys
 i oso dont wan to see how many infected .
 see liai oso like this .
 i wan to see how many died .
 then nobody know chiu keep importing .
 no wonder she is ceo
 of course chiu know who .
 who is she to make such a statement  ?
 she is prime minister of prime minister
 he invest so much in india ,  how can dont open floodgates to ceca ?
 dont report ,  just sweep everything under carpet .
 maybe will tell the doctors to attribute it to normal sickness and not covid ,  tadah .
 she or her family or ministers kena will be accorded the best health care for sure .
 no need to worry for them
 this is extremely worrying .
 our leaders taking it as a common flu .
 feel free to leave this discussion .
 do chiu know that hangzhou and xiamen are at least tier 2 ?
 in fact hangzhou is classified as  &apos;new tier 1 &apos; .
 so if chiu think that they are tier 3 cities then im afraid chiu are grossly mistaken .
 the gulf between the cities you &apos;ve listed and actual tier 3 cities are huge .
 i &apos;ve been to so many tier 3 cities over the past few years ,  such as the likes of zhanjiang ,  jilin ,  anshan ,  maanshan ,  baoding .
 try going to these places and tell me chiu can retire there .
 i &apos;d much rather retire in jb .
 i think thailand and malaysia better for sinkies .
  cost of living much lower and my visit to bkk hosital ,  i was quite impressed .
  oso closer to home .
 now ,  i think cheena long-term visa is still worth getting .
  may be live there for a few years and travel around a bit .
  so many place to see in cheena .
  can see panda ,  amazing mountains ,  cultural sites .
  every month take a trip oso can not see everything .
 i realise i’m mixing them up a little but xiamen/quanzhou cost of living is pretty alright .
 i’ve been to a few tier 3 cities in gansu ,  cq ,  sichuan ,  fujian and guangdong .
 i’d definitely stay in kunming for a bit .
 hainan can be expensive or cheap depending on your lifestyle .
 that’s the thing about cheena ,  chiu can live it up or live like a normal salaried worker there .
 i’ve lived in kl and will choose a tier 3 chinese city anytime over kl or jb .
 what does kl or jb have over a decent size chinese city ?
 but malaysia has one huge advantage which is better medical .
 i hate places which have no clinics chiu can just walk in .
 the problem with cheena is that the cost of living the last time you &apos;ve been there ,  and the next time you &apos;ll go there ,  will be drastically different .
 housing prices in cheena especially in tier 2 cities like xi &apos;an ,  are artificially inflated by the gahment and are not subject to market forces at work .
 xi &apos;an property prices used to be cheap ,  but about 5 years ago prices started to soar through the roof cos the gahment regarded xi &apos;an as being up and coming .
 legacy homeowners became millionaires overnight .
 baseline property prices are set by the gahment ,  which in turns results in inflation .
 what chiu think may be livable right now ,  may not be the case a few years down the road .
 im assuming that  &apos;retirement &apos; here refers to somewhere you &apos;ll live for the rest of your life or at least for the bulk of it .
 kunming i can see myself staying there for a year or two ,  but beyond that probably not .
 the same for any of the less developed cities out there .
 real tier 3 cities are still pretty much serving just the local market and seemingly untouched by globalization .
 public transportation is poor ,  air/train connections are poor ,  and chiu dont have many choices to dine out in luxury even if chiu wanted to .
 haidilaos are very often one of the most luxurious options chiu have in these cities (assuming they even have outlets there) .
 want a semi-decent steak/ hamburger ?
 chiu have a at best a handful of restaurants to choose from in the entire city .
 when i think retirement ,  i want to retire in comfort without having to regress in terms of my quality of life .
 if i have to compromise and sacrifice so much ,  am i really retiring happily then ?
 no one is talking to chiu just ignore my comment if it triggers chiu .
 compared to malaysia or thailand ,  cheena is further .
 so if chiu wan to come back singapore ,  the flight is longer and more tiring if to and fro often .
 i think chengdu is a nice place .
 though got earthquake risk .
 never been to hainan
 alamak ,  now talking abt retirement leh .
 me close to retirement in age but not in cash .
 if got money ,  of course can go ,  if not money ,  need to continue work and work until last breathe .
 now living and working in beijing ,  not sure if i would want to retire here .
 i would like to retire in japan though ,  since i can speak the language ,  but it will be tough if chiu dont speak nihongo .
 cheena is one of the worst place to retire in .
 retirees want clean safe and good healthcare .
 cheena is ranked very low on all 3
 want to retire means have to buy ppty there now .
 else the growth of these countries will push up ppty prices in ten years time
 both are correlation
 malaysia probably northern states better .
 thailand oni better if chiu know thai .
 outside of bkk ,  not alot of people know engrish .
 imo ,  taiwan would be better for retirement .
 cost of living low ,  good quality healthcare ,  relak slow pace of life + same language + can travel to cheena + kr + jp in 2-3 hours flight .
 i agree with retiring in style .
 but chiu said you’d rather retire in jb than a tier 3 chinese city ?
 maybe i haven’t been to jb in a bit but what high end restaurants do they have ?
 or what public transportation ?
 even taking a cab is like pulling teeth ,  thank goodness for grab .
 yes chiu can drive back to singapore but fighting the unpredictable customs isn’t much of a convenience compared to taking a short flight back .
 how much taiwan property price
 my uncle &apos;s friend retired over at lijiang like more than 10 years ago .
 he seem to enjoy his life very much .
 oni coming back to singapore every 3-4 years for a short visit .
 it do helps if u have a business to run over at cheena .
 but make sure chiu still have a house with a million dollars worth of funds locked up here ,  cos within the next few years ,  once chiu have been stripped nice ,  clean ,  and then dumped ,  chiu will be crying to come home .
 the property price not always up .
 chiu can see japan .
 the future of cheena is liddat .
 retire or semi retire can drive on off peak weekdays anytime .
 cost petrol fee dollar .
 airplane is hundred plus
 no joan of arc pogba
 wheres is nu wa ?
 shes mades humans 
 queen merkel of europe .
 where’s ho ching ?
 so far the female bosses i work with all cmi .
 forgers passing fake antique 10 , 000-yen notes around tokyo - the mainichi .

 21 and 26 ,  the mainichi shimbun has lea .
 2 vietnamese nationals suspected of importing fake japanese banknotes arrested again - the mainichi .
 tokyo -- two vietnamese nationals working in japan who have been indicted for circulating counterfeit currency were served fresh arrest warrants by to .
 if karma exist ,  why not working on those killers ?
 many american presidents oso sent others’ sons and daughters to fight and die in other countries  .
 so should they get karma ?
 karma doesnt exist .
 it &apos;s useless to believe in karma .
 i dont have to believe in karma to do good .
 if i want to do good ,  i do good
 my attitude too .
 karma is bluff people one ,  .
 for losers to make themselves self pity and feel good .
 when chiu do good ,  no need to believe in karma ,  just do it .
 if not ,   it is not truly good .
 but when chiu want to do bad ,  chiu must believe in karma .
 i laugh at the people who believe in karma ,  chiu want to teach bad people a lesson ,  chiu dont expect divine intervention ,  chiu make it happen .
 not everything happens due to karma
 didnt chiu see people ask why them when they or their loved ones meet misfortune ?
 someone posted the video recently on parents who lost their child .
 can go and watch ?
 he oredi got diabetes
 the pink one oredi kena 2x .
 last and final strike and he &apos;ll be taken out .
 everyday they are living in fear of coup  .
 it &apos;s a living hell for them everyday  .
 karma is not one can decide .
 bbfa: karma why chiu havent strike ?
 karma: sorry not free and not enough power .
 karma can oni strike on low ses bbfa not high profile people .
 who did he kill ?
 obama the nobel peace prize winner on the other hand killed how many innocents ,  like in one instance nearly all the people at a wedding with his indiscriminate drone strikes ?
 there were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during president barack obama’s presidency than under his predecessor ,  george w .
 obama embraced the us drone programme ,  overseeing more strikes in his first year than bush carried out during his entire presidency .
 a total of 563 strikes ,  largely by drones ,  targeted pakistan ,  somalia and yemen during obama’s two terms ,  compared to 57 strikes under bush .
 between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries ,  according to reports logged by the bureau .
 would have given chiu 1000 likes if i could !
 got ccp backing do evil thing no need scare karma ,  their culture revolution oredi destroyed all karma .
 and this above is the reason why asians ,  despite numerical advantage (higher probability of talent) will never surpass the whites and blacks in sports .
 not saying whether it is right or wrong .
 just saying that bro up there stated the reason .
 asians are simply too pragmatic and practical minded .
 it holds true even for most athletes events  .
 for able person .
 when prime years winning  oylimpic gold medals has to find commercial sponsors and business partnerships to earn by being on advertising and marketing such
 her reward money is inside the 1mdb fund is it ?
 what good does it do to surpass anyone in sports .
 when it dont bring in the dough .
 would chiu encourage your kids to dedicate themselves to excelling in  sports instead of excelling in their studies ?
 this is just modern day gladiators arena .
 entertainment for people  .
 and nothing else .
 chiu can see those with super athletes and sports players are those countries where the sports have been monetized enough for players to earn above average salaries .
 and can retired within 5-10yrs of contract .
 and the endorsement deals for the very top players .
   but those who dont make it to the top leauge oso are earning peanuts .
 oni join politician will get richer there .
 nothing beats studying to local uni and join silver serpent for s$8 .
 5k per month income from mid twenties till retirement time should be able to earn around s$5m shiok shiok conti car and private condominium apartment !
 its better to have some form of practical skills that can be applicable to the society .
 gotta win olympic medal in malaysia to have a lifetime of gahment sponsored salary for life(that is enough for normal living) .
 theres nothing for asean games medals i think .
 it &apos;s not about how much chiu earn ,  but how much chiu save .
 she was champion for many years ,  her prize money should be easily more than the earnings of alot of her countrymen .
 why she still selling tissues on the streets while her countrymen earning lesser than her are not selling tissues ?
 singapore each gold medal  is s$1m  .
 can win once every 4 years  .
 say start at 18 ,  max is 3 times gold champion by 30 can retire with s$3m
 jin sad to read dis
 will be waiting 1 day lee chong wei become my street cook
 have to give back to association 20% (compulsory) .
 then minus tax .
 left take home about $600+k per gold medal .
 not too shabby but nothing to shout about oso .
 different world different lives
 i mean taking a leaf here .
 squash as a sport in this world now is pretty much dead
 can get your number ?
 in case next time need your help ?
 if price is reasonable i guess sure got more people support
 w t f if the customer low iq de then i pity and curse the contractor .
 but if she agreed to $2500 for heater replacement then what is she complaining about sia .
 is she that massively disconnected with prices of household items
 maybe he cny not money give angpow .
 so charge extra $3k to give angpow to this workers .
 becoming a plumber now !
 buy from lazada $250 and charge $3350 sipeh hor tan .
 the woman must bow down ,  beg and cry on social media like the vietnamese man before the elites take any action .
 the boss now riding tiger and unable to come down .
 can imagine how heart pain she felt
 knn can buy lg oled tv and new water heater .
 3k contractor fapping to this thread now .
 er why she paid leh ?
 if find expensive dont pay and find others la .
 pay liao then go search on lazada then complain kena fleeced too late liao right .
 fierce sia this contractor .
 chopping gao gao
 cny chop carrot .
 his angpow came early .
 just as we dont get to choose our parents nor do our parents get to choose us .
 why shouldn &apos;t marriage be same way ?
 modern day dating  aka liberated sexual market makes dating too brutal .
 i see many unhappy left over ladies ,  and many shy bbfa left alone other wise are good mates .
 we want both hansum ,  bbfa ,  chio bu ,  dino bu to have equal chance
 free will and the illusion of choice is a b* as always .
 i used to be against it thinking that it’s a bad idea(during my 20s interacting with foreign colleagues) but i think it’s a good idea .
 after over a decade and seeing the degradation of women(go out and walk anywhere ,  you’ll see women wearing revealing clothing) as well as our hyper-sexualized society ,  i think dads arranging their daughter’s marriage is a good thing seeing how many single unwed mothers there are these days .
 arranged married means no love with each other .
 sleep separate room later on .
 treat each other as roommate or stranger .
 and there is no such thing as unhappy leftover ladies ,  all are happy ok
 this is called natural selection 
 arranged marriage most of the time will end up having children ,  but cannot guarantee both will stay together forever .
 modern day dating may or may not end up with a marriage ,  let alone children .
 ask the indians .
 easier for them to dictate their requirements  .
 if the male is shite then of course he wont get a slim attractive mate
 they &apos;ll stay together albeit unhappy  .
 chiu see many of those indians divorced ?
  &apos;tried to get an extinguisher  &apos; doesnt tell us whether there was any extinguisher
 is thish part of the east coast plan ?
 seems some water hose oso good for watering plants ,  can deal with such fires
 wa ,  very big fire
 this fire eventually burn down the whole place !
 my favourite fish soup and popiah stall .
 just when diners can eat in .
 ah gong wake up liao ?
 jin sad ,  now need to budget more or get divorced to buy new house 
 sinkies can retire with stock income
 prices going too much oredi .
 million dollar homes dont make sense  .
 in before “hdb prices are low” by papaya ibs
 property agents switching jobs to insurance liao
 how else to pay for the cdc vouchers .
 those suay one will wake up to a rude shock .
 out of nowhere have to pay extra ten of ks .
 currently property agents huating ,  chiu say they switching jobs ?
 these measures will oni affect some buyers , 
 measures oni affect a very specific rich group .
 how much impact it will have on public housing remains to be seen .
 desmond lim finally act .
 hdb resale prices should cool now .
 the mas chief say property price are ok this year .
 why suddenly u-turn ?
 must have let own kaki sell before it drop .
 moi oso wake up to this kind of news 
 i still cant afford .
 recession oni exist in edmw .
 while outside properties are booming until gahment need to cool it .
 coe is booming almost hitting $100k soon .
 extra 5% more cash down payment is nothing .
 most sinkie are cash rich ,  true story .
 my point exactly .
 most sinkie are cash rich .
 first buyers affected  ?
 why must future gen bear the burden  ?
 future gens will be crippled by debts and loans and will never replicate the success of boomers
 how much did we pay for the vaccines anyone know
 so the data of low adverse reactions is backed by these experts .
 if kena reactions cannot sue pharmaceutical companies .
 can sue these experts bo ?
 laughing at those  &apos;experts &apos; .
 jsm all the experts .
 lol they will backtrack as usual if things go haywire
 in the end if doesnt work then say the data is reviwed base on international standards etc etc .
 afterall they oni read the data .
 none are part of the clinical trials or have conducted one before .
 if chiu say they have been on the ground and part of the team who conducted the trial and study then say .
 experts at sucking cock and carrying balls
 well these so-called experts backed  &apos;healthy no need masks &apos; strategy just a few months before .
 can show us your r&d in backing up the pfizer vaccine ?
 your tests and studies as well .
 how many patients have chiu all tested to say the vaccine is safe for use ?
 chiu tried on yourself oredi ?
 look at others research ,  tests etc means say ok meh ?
 or just whistling from your anal canal ?
 what tok the bloombird ?
 hsa approved pfizer .
 chiu think committee of experts will say otherwise meh .
 have they confirmed that pfizer wont have mouth slant ?
 no names of  &apos;experts &apos; ,  no name of organisation ,  ownself sing ,  ownself song !
 names of the ass pert committee pls: .
 for post historical record
 experts and their families should inject first .
 can get those committee members de grandfather ,  grandmother ,  father and mother to take the jabs first ?
 tell those experts and their families to try the vaccines first before telling us to take .
 everything theory oni no action .
 they should inject themselves first before backing these vaccines
 useless expert there
 can i be release early than 3 days of my mc once i received sms token that my art and pcr test result is negative ?
 i had oso health hub app that shows both of my results too but i scare later tio arrest for not complying 3 days mc .
 kena before and clinic said once pcr result is negative ,  chiu can autoroam .
 can auto roam at geylang ?
 got to serve out your mc .
 vaccine oredi can take out ?
 whichever is sooner … .
 confirm can go out once chiu get confirmation of negative result .
 actually my mc stated put legalized to stay home for 3 days in bold .
 then the behind form put under condition 2 that im able to leave my house if i receive pcr negative result out .
 kinda confuse for me lor .
 so dont report new covid cases ,  but report new covid clusters ,  just like the dengues ?
 can liddat one ah ?
 i thought the world is recording down census on covid .
 ho jinx for world gahment yo !
 i agree ,  we should not report all the imported cases too .
 report for what use ?
 just whack all in ,  we are majority vaccinated ,  it &apos;s time to show the world what singapore can be .
 if dont report ,  other countries tourists may be more scared .
 doctors oredi confirmed that getting infected will let your immune systems produce antibodies with a longer lasting effect than vaccine ,  no need simi booster jab every 6 months .
 most flu patient dunnid to have oxygen mask .
 covid delta variant can cause death and more severe than flu leh .
 haha ,  so all the ktv clusters is part of the master plan is it ?
 do chiu think people in the ivory tower will care ?
 they just want to open legs wide & welcome ceca ,  since they hint few times they going to let high risk countries people come in .
 we all know who these people are from .
 should stop counting now ,  wasting tax pay money for useless stats .
 it &apos;s just a flu
 why need the covid task force + sexperts if we have hole jinx ?
 why he making statements online ?
 lor ,  if im  &apos; him  &apos; i behind laughing loud .
 the usual is no need to report figures/breakdown etc .
 magically statistics get disappeared or lump together
 just pray virus mutate and new strain is even less potent but more transmissible and it overtakes the current strains as the dominant one .
 thats usually how mutations work .
 become less potent but more transmissible to survive longer .
 i played plague inc ok .
 in fact many many still dunno yet .
 they &apos;re not called dafts for no reason .
 hc tok until so brave .
 the moment hong kong says ban us again for not reporting numbers ,  miw prata back  
 if flu ,  then open our border la .
 allow the pub ,  ktv ,  discos and geylang to open lor .
 and stop wearing mask .
 cos they did good deeds last life ,  now enjoying
 karma is selective ,  chiu see the bad guys out day still happily living .
 cos his citizen no curse him mah .
 they pray for him as if his a god .
 many american presidents sent other people’s sons and daughters to die in needless wars .
 they are as guilty as or way more guilty than kim
 although many people said dont believe in karma or asked if it exists ,  but subconsciously they do .
 in forum or online some can talk big ,  dont believe or simi bad guy no karma or is bs etc oni weak believes blah blah blah .
 if go by those logic ,  everyone oso can do bad deed or follow those bad people &apos;s step what .
 but most of them dont ,  online acting big easier ,  by typing  &apos;don &apos;t exist &apos; or  &apos;is bs &apos; .
 since they oredi said no karma just try do the same thing ,   show off your feat & deeds here ,  what bad sht u had done and u still living happily etc .
 the next type is really believe no karma .
 or hopefully ownself believes (self psycho) no karma ,  cause they done lot of bad deeds ,  if believe le means karma coming for them or next lives etc .
 highest ses should be amoy ?
 pulau tekong canteen
 living cost oni lower in tier 2 and 3 cities right ?
 big cities like shanghai very ex .
 japanese central bank in the 1980s did not aspire and their governor announce they had no plans of currency internationalisation .
 chinese aiming to have a larger pie in the currency reserves game .
 chiu guys just too one dimensional .
 if cheena manage to take a larger pie of the currency game ,  their yuan can be appreciate versus sgd over time and even if the ppty price stays flat ,  a 4:1 exchange rate means u be paying in sgd 20% more than today
 well is a place to just earn money if chiu had the capital to start business listen to ccp will earn alot but 100% not a place to stay .
 u see alot of taiwan celebrities earn so much in cheena but why they still hold on to their taiwan passport ?
 hongkong tycoons so good life in hong kong after cheena take over run tails in between their legs .
 kris wu oso from cheena he oso leave cheena for canada passport which he can use to escape if something goes wrong .
 and cheena housing is a problem as well chiu wouldnt know when they flip prata like the recent riot .
 the property developer can from free parking then sudden charge a premium sum of money
 depends on where chiu wanna live .
 taipei is ex - generally more ex than your typical hdb but cheaper than singapore condo .
 outside of taipei is cheap .
 i prefer south taiwan area .
 its like jb but 100% safe and speak chinese .
 can foreigners own condo there or normal landed house
 retirement in anywhere except singapore should be good .
 for me ,  i will choose retire in indonesia
 why not its great to stay there ,  i personally lived in beijing for 2 yrs song song gao jurong
 still need to swab pigu hole when go in and out of cheena ?
 retirees want quality clean life which means u retire in a developed economy probably in a small city .
 candidates are japan ,  korea ,  australia ,  malaysia taipei or a mix of those rotate between them just a flight away .
 dont mind distance can consider small american canadian european cities
 owning car in malaysia is probably more costly than returning from cheena to singapore a few times a year .
 anyway i’ve lived in kl and while it’s nice nobody can convince me that kl or any malaysian city is better than living in cheena .
 think of all the times chiu visited kl or jb what did chiu do and where did chiu visit ?
 this im not sure .
  when i was there ,  i either rented or my friends/relatives brought me around
 let that digest ,  if want to retire there better buy a ppty now
 cheena property oni 60y lease
 i afraid that the cheese is too nice to eat over there
 fine but not malaysia .
 japan and korea are hard if you’re a typical local .
 try taking a cab in seoul .
 man the hotel concierge beamed the address to the cabby’s gps and he still drove us to the wrong place .
 i can’t imagine visiting a hospital during an emergency .
 taiwan is probably the best choice but they’ve an albatross hanging over their neck which is cheena .
 should be 70 years .
 for one i know singapore food quality is crap and quantity is miserly .
 decent quality/quantity starts at $7+ .
 my overweight friend went to japan and slimmed down .
 been there for travel .
 air definitely is good ,  mountain area ,  the locals arent as cutthroat as other small town or cities .
 i will look at water and hospital quality not sure how is it there ,  at most it would be kunming .
 feel damn sad after reading this .
 malaysia and singapore really treat our sportsmen like crap .
 meanwhile ,  they keep importing all those foreigners to represent us when they could have trained our own and give them all the support they need to win .
 what about lee chong wei ?
 really is a sad case .
 national players last time feel proud when playing for their country  .
 in the end get thrown like a rubbish .
 when young ,  country ,  schools cultivate them .
 when old ,  country throw them away ,  if lucky ,  give them coaching jobs or positions within organisations
 their lives and ours ,  are just numbers in the book of the establishment .
 once used ,  it &apos;s used .
 get use to it .
 part of the reason is cos of her race is it ?
 sad life of athletes in this region .
 hope joseph schooling can find job after his swimming is over 
 its truly asia .
 where is our lim tong hai & steven tan ?
 win some kampong cup macham like win epl
 coaching career alrdy no end
 paralympic swimmer by day ,  tissue seller by night 
 chiu win medal for country means country owe u a living ?
 nobody in those association made promises to feed them for life .
 the smart ones play for money .
 the stupid ones play for pride and get used by their gahment .
 take care of your own pocket first before thinking about  &apos;glory for nation &apos; .
 no one will give a damn when u are useless .
 unless u r in nba or epl .
 that’s like loose $400+k per medal  omg 
 what do u expect people like joseph schooling to do after 30… ?
 moving on to survive .
 either are given a management role by sport council .
 if not ,  best is open a school and brand like ang peng siong .
 singapore treat ft better .
 usually will be ft win .
 so no worries .
 means whiles alls the bui bui generals sits in orpits posts fb ands gets millions dollars packages  .
 gahmens sarports nots measureds bys dollars and cents 
 the 20% back to association can be considered like sort of cpf contribution bah   
 well nobody asked u to win a medal .
 should shutdown the oympig and all the worthless sports events
 stakes are raised
 gahmen should follow them oso 
 *me dying in fire* .
 “before u touch me can i see your tracetogether pls”
 not quite the same situation .
 it &apos;s the firemen not wanting to take the vaccine
 its me asking to see their tracetogether before i will allow them to rescue me .
 can’t have filthy unvaccinated hands touching me u know ,  puts my life in danger
 they are making a conscious decision not to allow shix to be injected into their body .
 that is their freedom .
 gotta respect all this people that defy vaccine .
 they never throw in their towel despite peer pressure or state pressure .
 meanwhile sinkie unvax no shopping mall no dine at anywhere for u ,  alot throw in towel n go vax liao
 they are more united .
 sinkie oredi divided vax cursing unvax .
 there are still some sinkie who are unvax despite all the discrimination and bullying la .
 the difference is that they can stand their ground and we dont have any .
 is all the jlb vax  ?
 yah some oni ,   .
 but very few liao  .
 mostly are below 12 years old + medical condition  .
 the defiant one that fit n healthy and has no vaccine allergy  ,  alot has gave up liao .
 i would like see if any edmw still standing their ground
 sinkie are just human livestock .
 the oni one who can afford not to vax should oni be the elites and the croonies themselves .
 there is no ground to stand .
 the ground belongs to the croonies .
 once chiu take away one livelihood ,  chiu are just a coward doing all the bullying .
 any decrease in cases after the mall ban  ?
 chiu can see for yourself .
 so many rather retire or quit
 am jin satki man
 latest ,  many throw letter liao .
 mayor said to brace for short of ambulance ,  hcw n mata
 blm protest can .
 blm protesters spit at police ,  can .

 well i will start the ball rolling .
 top up a bit get the glc .
 cheaper than new harrier hybrid .
 not a comfortable ride .
 do not have the suv feel .
 please buy its worth it
 in before the renault engine ,  entry level model or over leveraged buyers nonsense again
 sure renault engine ?
 like any korean or jap car ,  with merc logo .
 top up a bit get a porsche
 look very orbit
 top up a bit buy c class bah .
 some people here like to call it the renault engine .
 the m282 was developed with renault and nissan as part of daimler &apos;s collaboration with the renault–nissan–mitsubishi alliance .
 [2] the m282 shares the same design with the renault h5ht engine ,  with a dohc and direct injection .
 the m282 is oso the first mercedes inline-four engine to feature cylinder deactivation (on the second and third cylinders) ,  as well as an engine particulate filter .
 [3] it is produced by mdc power gmbh at the kölleda plant in thuringia ,  germany .
 -built in germany .
 -for mercedes vehicles  .
 -assembled with vehicles in germany & other countries (diff merc models is made in diff locations)
 anyway my ceca neighbour have one .
 brand new ,  the gla200 variant .
 looks ok ,  cant really fault the design ,  alot of the modern crossover vibes but too feminine or  &apos;soft looking &apos; for me ,  just like the a-class hatch/saloon and cla .
 drove for a week in brisbane in 2019 .
 does not make my heart beat faster when i floor it .
 in before entry level merc ,  xiasuay .
 top up a bit to buy a ferrari .
 cos today &apos;s problems are mostly caused by young people .
 see first tine buyers cannot afford to buy liao .
 hopefully these karens that kpkb singles should be entitled to buy before 35yrs one can now work even harder and save more money .
 by the time they have enough to buy ,  they aldy 40s+  thank u pap !
 my wish come true that they cannot buy at 35 !
 i think this wouldnt put a dent in our housing market ,  at all .
 such weak measures .
 they have no iron to whack even harder
 resale flats going to be over one million each in a few year &apos;s time .
 hdb loan ltv still a bit high leh .
 should decrease even further but give more subsidies to young families who truly need it .
 wait until now then cool .
 will see listing price cut ?
 assuming 1mil hdb  .
 the 5% drop is amount loanable is just 50k lol  .
 coe oredi 80+k  .
 i think this just means that property is set for next long bull run
 more single bbfa to get stuck living with parents
 siao liao for bbfas
 bbfas oso cham liao
 how can they do this to us ?
 we always have voted for pap chiu know 
 oh god prease let me die 
 gahment introducing this latest measures ,  yet again ,  can oni mean 1 thing .
 property prices sure chiong & fence sitters plus edmw naysayers waiting for firesale can continue to wait 
 u heng gahment never tweak property tax rates for all your holdings 
 china &apos;s current property problems (evergrande induced) will likely have a dampening effect on world wide property prices .
 not when your own cheena nationals are fleeing cheena with bags of cash to buy singapore properties .
 end up chinese  &apos;patriots &apos; is making our properties reach new time high  .
 is beyond reach for many now
 means reserving the playground for the richer folks .
 years down ,  they will be even richer .
 property agents are the ones keep frying the property up ,  too many property agents these days ,  new launches many snapped up by them for a flip
 so how he defend himself .
 ownself never do homework then kena chopped .
 really don’t know what to say liao .
 if next time she want to do house reno then how sia ?
 i would avoid him honestly
 case is the number one jlb in singapore .
 can crowd fund to help the lady please .
 think she has young child .
 just registered another company name ,  cheap cheap nia .
 just change without double checking .
 wtf where is the pic of the seller ?
 here no laws to execute all these farkers .
 1st world country but 3rd world behavior
 never see first post meh  if have gun ownership here ,  the man oredi kena lor .
 but seriously ,  woman did not ask for quote first before green-lighting the work ?
 this is not like getting overcharged for cai png leh .
 i think his competitors will pui chao nua .
 do house reno maybe charged 100k .
 i once asked a malaysian plumber to quote me a price to replace three faulty switches .
 he said he was busy and to contact him again .
 a month later ,  i contacted him and he quoted me a different price ,  twice the amount .
 he oso told me a ceiling fan has to be replaced completely .
 by the way ,  he has no license .
 i dropped him immediately and went back to my regular local electrician/plumber .
 his price is not any cheaper but he managed to repair my ceiling fan and most importantly ,  he is a licensed electrician .
 i change my heater ,  buried inside false ceiling oso not so ex .
 think can hack down the old tiles ,  lay new tiles ,  install rain shower ,  basin sink toilet and still got balance left .
 farking jian shang saying he is not !
 now really some people really very thick skin to chop people .
 i once contact a handyman to do something .
 he quoted me at a higher price then advertised .
 and told me what covid no business cant earn much thus knew that previously charged to little .
 so now need to charge higher .
 i find another handyman .
 charged me 30% of what he charge .
 oni listen to the good stuff .
 but when unvaccinated get sick come out  and blast to the world .
 she is the wife of our pm .
 but dunno why it feels like we are in ancient china
 thought she exclusively pushes pfizer ,  now change to pushing mrna/moderna oredi ?
 basically pap oni cares about the first part of her 3rd sentence  &apos; vaccinate so we can re-open our economy  &apos; to south asians .
 we have mtf and if that does not provide enough clarity .
 we have unknown unlimited power person providing more information on gahment direction .
 confused who is real authority .
 buyed your kukujiao la
 were chiu crying as chiu typed that ?
 looking forward to your next 3p drinking session peek
 nice feel good movie to watch with your kym .
 robert de niro epic performance .
 not bad ,  but one of those feel good movies hollywood churns out each year .
 angmo can film such nice movie with this kind of theme .
 chinese movie can never do that
 the story is kinda predictable: the old intern (robert de niro) aces in every task given to him and scores points and builds rapport with the ceo (anne hathaway) .
 i watched it last night cos i do not have anything better to watch .
 good movie for boomers .
 remind em if they lose their current deadend job can oni get intern position in new job .
 so they no choice gotta work hard show face in office then kpkb strawberries lazy n like to complain .
 chinese movies always the same .
 undercover cop story .
 high school love story .
 excessive cgi mythical story
 quite like this movie .
 pap should show this movie on ch 5 for the boomers  
 cannot get enough of anne hathaway ,  later watching the devil wears prada on disney+
 devil wears prada is part 1 .
 the intern is part 2
 anne had a problem ,  anne hathaway .
 nice movie gentlemen 
 if jav maybe can bang the chio bu ceo
 i forgot prada &apos;s storyline
 very old show liao
 part 1 she was the intern .
 part 2 she supervise an intern
 just cut off kukujiao .
 try these places .
  &apos;kena the virus &apos; rehabilitation center is ncid
 bedok reservoir  ?
 if really ktv all close down i think open such a centre is a must .
 must force them all to kick this habit  .
 the gong tao power too strong and toxic .
 bet all  the sinkiebu will support this idea .
 if after update bsod ,  how sia ?
 270 days for now ,  might be more frequent .
 even if no shortage of firemen and cops ,  the shortage of sanitation oredi enough for them to all die in filth liao .
 if they wear mask is ok .
 they just want to pressure people n if they quit when they don’t have to worry abt money then gd for them .
 go find other things to do then to be forced to jab .
 usa is a big country can move to those v ulu place n no one near u how to catch covid .
 if enough medical staff quit due to this then the gahment can go work in the front line
 that one still ok .
 the everyday go poke is expose unvac to unnecessary risk
 talk so big ,  sure will back down one la ,  most of these angmo can oni last without their regular paychecks for at most one or two cycles ,  i .
 can go other jobs .
 us is a big country .
 i saw a news of doctor not wanting to be vaccinated .
  just need to find work in another republican state that don’t have such mandate .
 can continue liao
 if vax is voluntary then they shouldn &apos;t be blamed when they are not allowed to work and causes a shortage of manpower
 chiu mean yourself ar ?
 i am still unvaxxed and holding strong for now .
 same here but feel very lonely in singapore when i see the situation in usa
 who needs whom more  ?
 they need their jobs .
  or their jobs need them ?
 based on singapore data .
 below 40 take vaccine like useless ?
 so if their firefighters all young then take vax for what .
 they neh see this video ?
 dont talk without thinking .
 she &apos;s a paralympic and she competed in an era (early 00s) where the paralympics was super under the radar unlike today .
 i was from the sports industry way back then & im pretty confident most if not all of her competitions had no prize money one .
 refer to post #16
 listen listen listen ,  sports are just an event created by businessmen .
 listen listen listening is a sport too .
 @nugeme @full_cream_milk @henghengonedragon is rucky cutie loh neber stayed in jiuhu hor  
 heng i esports champion just stream on twitch got money liao .
 no shame in selling tissues .
 it is an honest job .
 the reality is that handicapped persons face discrimination and athletic skills mostly do not pay .
 if anything ,  chiu should spend more time to study programming or hot white collar work than to train for whatever sports .
 how did the medal become part of a bicycle ?
 dont think yip pin xiu will end up as the same predicament as malaysia and singapore are totally different ,  then again i feel that she really overhyped as a para athlete .
 so why do chiu think lky came ?
 if badminton world champion can get money ?
 then dota world champion get get ?
 how about candy crush ?
 where does it end ?
 if people want to join a competition that doesnt pay ,  then its their choice right ?
 meanwhile ,  without being number 1 ,  tons of football players earning millions .
 cannot be coach after that ?
 van start onlyfans .
 age old profession for a reason
 tiagong tiong olimpig gold medalist sell medal and beg in the streets !
 moral of story ?
 why dont these athletes play sports that people will pay to watch .
 liddat dunnid to depend on gahment handouts .
 footballers and basketballers are paid millions .
 tennis pays well too .
 in fact ,  what’s the heck is world champion for paralympic ?
 look at swimming ,  the competitors have different disabilities - that itself is not fair among them oredi .
 this shown us ,  if want to play sport seriously .
 sport is oni play seriously oversea .
 south east asia dont give a sh*t on local sports .
 oni cared about economic ,  employment rate and money money money .
 the rest are secondary .
 look at schooling ,  he and his family know about this very well for sure .
 300rm per month .
 all i know women oni want $
 so gla ,  oni gla250 then is true mercedes-benz .
 however ,  amg is the real deal .
 the facelift gla interior is not as impressive as compared the pre-fl version .
 rear seats are now wider with more leg room but somehow something is amiss ,  too many plastic panels .
 $180k for a underpowered merc what do chiu think ?
 i dunnid that much horsepower in singapore but i want to know that i have it should i need it for that kind of money .
 just like a 1 .
 ts ,  seriously ,  if chiu like it ,  just buy it if it is within your means .
 everyone will have their own opinion in here .
 chiu will get replies like it &apos;s a renault engine .
 it is a lousy car .
 it is for badge hunters etc .
 just buy it if chiu like .
 but then ,  top up a bit buy the glc    
 top up a bit buy helicopter
 suv is never for comfort .
 chiu want comfort ride go for sedan .
 suv suspension is not tune for comfort ,  intentionally .
 well the higher torque at earlier rpm easily wins all this rubbish 1 .
 this is not a fl .
 this is entirely new model leh ,  different gen liao
 dont waste money on a 120hp car .
 but 180k for the extra torque not worth it leh
 this new gla is a complete make over compare to the last one .
 this one has better size and road presence .
 that money got alot of options
 bro ,  it is all about the three pointer logo !
 yeah all along im talking about the new one mah .
 what is your car bhp ?
 those who knows about cars will not spend this amount on this model .
 look at the torque and nog bhp .
 most mercedes tune their entry level with turbo charger to get over 200 nm at low rpm .
 so in the end must look at how many second it can sprint from 0-100km
 like it or not this car is sold out at agent until end of the year .
 your next question is price yes ?
 that’s cos japanese cuisine is very one dimensional .
 sushi is sushi is sushi .
 tempura is tempura is tempura .
 it’s how i feel whenever i visit india ,  while indian food is great i got so sick of it after a few days .
 i feel like i can’t look at another ramen after a week in japan .
 singapore dunnid u de .
 buying taiwan apartment now !
 one in cheena one in tw
 taiwan is good .
 but it seems their permanent residency not easy to get ?
 id be happy to leave singapore if an opportunity comes about .
 im sure after travelling to many places ,  chiu do realise these small things are not unique to singapore .
 they can blow their balloon and toot their horns .
 oni silly people will believe .
 their economy is as neck deep in debt as the americans .
 watch porn need to use vpn i think i go new zealand lol
 i dont see language as an issue .
 by eliminating a candidate just based on language is silly cos it can be changed .
 language can be picked up over time .
 location (ease of flying around) ,  weather/air quality ,  natural disasters ,  cost of living ,  culture ,  safety/prevalence of scammers ,  all these cannot be changed .
 and if we just look at those unchangeable factors ,  i think japan/korea/taiwan would rank tops .
 sg &apos;s weather and lack of chio bus (or rather ,  the overinflated values of them) are key reasons i wanna leave .
 wads the name of the visa i cannot find .
 fake news isit ?
 need 200k usd /6 million ntd to invest in a business .
 after 5 years can apply  arc .
 but must be legit biz
 been to many cities in cheena .
 lijiang is my favourite .
 kunming and dali oso not bad .
 more countryside feel and less hectic lifestyle .
 in july ,  temperatures there doesn’t exceed 25 degrees .
 good to explore for a few months to escape the heat and humidity in singapore .
 even if u talk abt clean non yellow tap water alone .
 asia oni got 5-10 countries that can offer that .
 most of us speak the same language but with a far less proficiency .
  most sinkies cannot speak mandarin all the way .
  at least one third of the time ,  they would need to borrow words from engrish .
 and i am not referring to dialect speaking boomers .
 i am referring to yoomers and zoomers ,  whom i have heard speaking mandarin quite often .
 language is very important when it comes to emigration ,  which is why many sinkies chose australia .
 their command of engrish is stronger .
 the other thing is the way things are done there .
  and if chiu are talking about a retiree ,  he is so used to the system here ,  it may be harder for him to adapt to a new system  .
  every country is run differently .
 those who have worked and lived abroad know this .
  so ,  if chiu have worked and lived in cheena before ,  say for ten years ,  well ,  it is easy for chiu to retire there .
  but if chiu have not ,  and wish to emigrate there when chiu are 60 years old ?
 i believe chiu went there with a travel company ?
  dynasty travel ,  chan bros ,  etc ?
 it is always nice when chiu go to a country as a tourist .
 always visit the place free and easy via direct flight to kunming .
  used to go there in july every year .
 with the high speed rail ,  it’s so convenient to travel around the country .
 it &apos;s a good place to stay for a couple of years max(like singapore and dubai) but not for long term .
 i cannot tahan living in a place where information is contained in a closed bubble .
 but if chiu just want to watch kdrama ,  ktv ,  eat/drink and dont want to know more about other stuffs ,  then it might suit chiu .
 say no to cheena .
 thats good enough .
 it &apos;s not as if chiu are going to retire in 101 countries .
 chiu are going to retire max in 2 countries .
 that cyclist oso record the driver &apos;s action  .
 never endin &apos; battle
 dunno who is more annoying .
 the passenger who was recording or the rider .
 speak broken engrish still video until so satki
 cycling use hp is wrong
  &apos;cos the driver was doing the same ?
 it was the passenger that is holding the phone la
 cyclist very irritating especially those who dunno how to cycle but still cycle .
 nearly got knock down while taking a stroll at mbs yesterday .
 why driver use phone while driving is offence ,  but cyclist use handphone is not ?
 got cycling lane but not using ?
 why am i not surprised ?
 i agree that the cyclists should be in the cycling lane ,  but is there a need to be so upset or annoyed when the rest of the 3 lane road is wide open and deserted ?
 it &apos;s the in thing these days .
 chiu dont follow ,  chiu lose out .
 if there are proper designated infrastructure build for usage and you &apos;re not using then what &apos;s the point ?
 like got public toilet but chiu choose to **** in public ?
 no go overseas last year ,  many didnt hit their spending quota thats why spend it on brompton
 if chiu cant even follow basic traffic rules ,  how to have people &apos;s trust and believe when chiu demanding for more cycling lanes all over singapore ?
 chiu have no right to demand or request for anything when chiu cannot even follow basic rules .
 and neither will anyone believe chiu will behave ,  since chiu have proven chiu cant .
 tour de singapore getting serious
 cyclists in the wrong in the first place ,  still want to record simi ?
 didnt know we were left hand drive .
 foreigner should pay 10% absd first purchase .
 my place now sky always look darker
 hdb ones are kuching kura la… .
 this one is whack hiong hiong on the pr and foreigners buying private… .
 that’s where all the money is… .
 landed (with approval hor) la .
 wealth tax lai lo
 they have to find new ways to tax no doubt .
 increasing tax or new forms of tax are to be expected .
 economy “opening” up is i guess the really a opener for all their plans .
 many of them are poorer now with the plunge in property prices in cheena .
 will they pay for higher price property here instead ?
 is going to hit the middle class stinkaporean .
 not sure how much it will affect rich people who buy under trust and home office
 our garment waiting for them to come and refill the tax coffers wor… .
 for amount used during the pandemic  .
 those who bought oredi and expect to make a profit flipping will suffer .
 the measures not much .
 1 or 2 btc can settle the difference
 expected the cooling measures as the market was really too hot and ridiculous .
 personally it &apos;s ok for the measures to tighten for non sinkies and entities buying second or third property .
 but what i dont get is the tdsr and loan limit measures as many of the people playing the market are cash rich oredi .
 this measure is half effective against them and really will hurt younger people looking for a home and not investing .
 wtffffff heng i buyed liao
 hopefully no need raise gst liao 
 few months later may see news of buyers/property agents kena caught for trying to backdate otp to before 16 dec
 as long as they run away from toxic cheena ?
 this is the so called patriotism lol
 oni the rich can buy house .
 this measure dont help anything at all .
 first time buyer lose out more .
 papayas can leeplace them with ceca talents
 their “solution” is always increase price .
 10% increase to 30% for foreigners buyers ?
 that will oni push up even higher for ppty lol…… they are cash rich… .
 these kind of “measures” oni gahmen win only… .
 good luck to those locals buying
 wait for prices to come down and buy in full cash !
 why afternoon got kids show ah ?
 jin classic movie
 in before another kind of adult transformers
 okto timebelt has moved to channel 5
 wtf is this sh1t ?
 g1 is still the best
 ran jiao bian cheesepie !
 ah guas in disguise !
 not this kinda transformer ?
 is that rachet ?
 wtf is this monstrosity ?
 why transformers going backwards
 i think the movie finding mr right ,  chinese movie not bad too
 the ending feels like they suddenly realised that they no more budget .
 part 3 she xxx with intern
 the sax scene at the end  .
 devil wears prada is not a nice movie ,  a for-woman show ,  or maybe i do not know how to appreciate fashion .
 should watch dark knight rise .
 make your dark knight rise too !
 now that chiu mention… .
 this kind of old drop teeth ,  women power show can forget it .
 it was produced during the period where #metoo was in vogue and the jokes ,  storyline and feel good factor in the end are highly predictable even without watching .
 watch for anne hathaway at best .
 singapore one leh ?
 it &apos;s mainly about how well the monetization of the sports is in that particular country .
 then u go and learn .
 but usually sports team got more chance  .
 since there will be leagues and they required alot of players
 please leh if so many gold in singapore is millionaire liao leh thats not even including the training funds they would have receive .
 oni clueless edmwer think gahment doesnt support our athlete .
 like schooling before he won olympic gold ,  training funds aline he would have receive more than 100k+ thats excluding the prize money from sea games and commonwealth games etc .
 but edmw is kpkb gahment never support schooling .
 same case with loh kean yew .
 he is on spex scholarship for last 2 years .
 monthly stipend oredi 8-10k thats not counting the other training support he receives but edmw say gahment never do anything for him
 singapore small market mah .
 all the south americans and africans oso go to europe to play football .
 if want to pursue career in sports ,  must go to the big leagues .
 the guys here are not that ignorant .
 they are aware that the sportsman are paid for all their expenses and training by the tax payers and sponsors .
 my point still stand .
 if that is the case ,  then all the millionsters should not be getting any bonus at all since they are working for passion and love for the country .
 i am talking about additional prize money to spur the sportsman .
 this is the money for them to keep .
 or else there is no benefit for them to win any medals since there is no difference even if they lose .
 if chiu dont get it ,  then never mind .
 if the millionsters are so money minded about their high pay ,  the same should be apply for the sportsman too .
 dont give empty talk about love and passion for the country when they themselves are not applying it themselves .
 whats your big goals for 2022  ?
 dont gib cai png related ans ok .
 i wan gf and job promotion .
 i want to be like @tankgunner korkor .
 1) 60kg again ,  slim ,  fit ,  six pac ,  boxing .
 2) learn marketing .
 3) finish learning japanese
 piak like jj ,  365 days no repeat .
 moi is hope wfh back to default !
 5 posts / hr (60 mins) = about 1 post every 15mins everyday for next year ,  i think quite achievable .
 solo toto first prize .
 wanna be a happier person and less materialistic
 60kg is very light leh for guy  ,  how tall are u  ?
 how u think u will be a happier person  ?
 oni if i pcw stably at that rate .
 but we know irl is not ideal ,  conditions are not ideal ,  so i wont be able to post at that stable rate .
 some days i pcw many ,  some days slow or none .
 sometimes i get treated all-expenses-paid-for holiday by the mods
 this one is provided u are not sleeping at all .
 smooth sailing year ,  take things easier laugh things off ,  stay healthy and hopefully can endemic soon and siam diu all open
 should have minored in cheena stardees then  
 help chiu to plus one here .
 earn a million .
 fug lotsa poosies
 better job or retire 
 3350 can install a system 3 aircon liao .
 bo song just turn the steering wheel to the left a bit can liao mah .
 maybe driving cd car
 or maybe road trip from myanmar .
 later those self-entitled retarded wusses-in-tights whine and play victim card how ?
 this kind of mentally challanged people have to treat with kids gloves one ,  their victim card skills are second to none .
 all jump onboard the stupid bandwagon ,  thinking they got bicycle and wear tights and helmet means very satki ,  people not on bicycle are expected to siam and give way to them like macam red carpet royal family liddat .
 the blindly follow trend people
 create 101 rules but no enforcement .
 even the penalties oso not high enough to deter road junkies .
 lets hope the silly cyclist will post the video he took of the car .
 then he can get fine for using hp while cycling .
 i think we will soon see a thread: .
 annoying car driver on the road again​ .
 he entrepreneur spirit
 kena chop chop chop .
 i wonder why it &apos;s so difficult  ?
 i just walked into imm ,  plenty of shops there selling water heater with price displayed .
 just asked for price one shop after another .
 no shops there will chop chiu .
 lol born with that pai lang face hard enough to be nice guy with all the skeptics  .
 now he just pwned his own biz
 lmao at that face
 contractor may have just done the most expensive water heater installation in singapore .
 next thing we know all the others will oso be quoting this price and give a 50% discount .
 then telling the not to bright people they are getting a good deal .
 that goes to show how badly singapore is run .
 if anyone dare to quote the reason is due to free pricing in market he or she has no shame and no sense of right and wrong
 it &apos;s ok ,  he can earn this $3350 .
 nobody will give him business anymore .
 jamie zz looks cutes rehs  .
 she sho rich 3k just swipes ?
 hearsay is not chop carrot .
 it is called  &apos;income opportunity &apos; leh .
 true free pricing .
 need to check few shops .
 jove plus installation ,  i think less than $400 can settle liao .
 actually is true ,  u see those do installation ,  if one project oni $100+ ,  how many yrs one change heater ?
 one month can change how many ?
 need to cover van/parts/salary/diesel etc .
 of course as consumers ,  we want lesser rate
 the woman very rich 3k like peanuts just pay .
 i dont even have $300
 isnt that oso the name of the sls iphone cheater ?
 your logic is astounding .
 why the fuck the woman willingly pay 3k plus for a fking water heater
 after kena sexposed by media ,  of cos he like dat say la  .
 arbo chiu want him say he  &apos;accidentally &apos; add another 0 behind meh  .
 but then again  ,  oso cannot blame him  .
 they are in the biznes where ,   can chop just chop  .
 same as those in contractor/renovation industry ,  for sure they will chop chiu  .
 to them is just a  &apos;sop &apos;  .
 those in these industries will know what moi meant  .
 if the single mum is a chio bu .
 i think no one will side the other party .
 many tio pawned by title
 stop reading at sai sudhakar
 glassdoor rating good sia
 ceca runs complex projects .
 complex tech scam projects that is .
 they are the tech scam capital of the world .
 ah pa is correct
 moe better cum clean why our students so bekkan ?
 time to send our teachers to india to learn from em
 look at all these ceos .
  now we have the answer as to why we are suffering from withdrawal symptoms - disguised as a  &apos;labour crunch/shortage &apos; .
 hope mom does a thorough investigation of all these companies for unfair hiring practices .
 interview ceca ceo of course he is going to support ceca .
 dont expect much from our local media
 why dont go back india to do ?
 sinkies low caste mah .
 of course oni their people are the best .
 sinkies better to reflect .
 apar hahah inside is full of ceca
 a nation sold/betrayed ,  truly .
 very good body of ceca experts .
 really see sinkies no up and mass import from same village .
 pui ceca psycho gahmen to bring village to takeover sinkapore
 in before sgreans are xenophobic and racist .
 hard truths for sinkies !
 better repent now !
 in another sense ,  learning and growth opportunity exported overseas .
 we need their talent and leadership to prosper .
 its true in a way .
 the actual truth is cheap labour .
 nothing new ,  not just singapore .
 its everywhere else .
 why angmo countries come to singapore for manufacturing back then ,  is it cos singapore are technologically more advanced ?
 we were just cheaper .
 its not as if cheena workers are better at assembling iphones than american workers .
 or thai workers are way better than japanese workers is assembling toyota cars .
 or batam worker are better than their singapore counterparts .
 its just cheaper .
 now days pr can spin the story a bit more .
 at the end its just cheaper labour .
 for this base gla180 1 .
 it &apos;s almost 10 second leh 
 x second ,  still quite respectable if chiu compare many 1 .
 5l jippun car still at 12-14 second .
 big liter means nothing .
 6s oredi no shiok liao .
 chiu oso lexus owner ?
 no le i am unruly typical ahbeng no signal bmw owner 
 nx300 with a massive 2 .
 5l engine can oni deliver 9 .
 same as gla 1 .
 jippun really cmi now when come to engineering efficiency
 well close to 10 s means even prius phv or those turbodiesels taxis oso can outrun chiu if they try hard enough 
 top up a bit more can get bombardier business jet liao lol .
 top up a bit get c class  .
 5 is old model i think .
 the newer one is 2 .
 5 seconds or so .
 hybrid + big na engine is not v fast one
 8l engine can oni do 11 .
   i oredi said jippun really cmi when come to engine efficiency  .
 based on their driving behavior i &apos;d thought it will be faster haha
 i know the new 2l is very powerful ,  but chiu are talking about $30k more than this gla ,  not apple to apple la ,  chiu should compare with glc !
 i mean it is not comfortable as compared to other suvs .
 driving behavior is it the topic of discussion here la ,  if chiu give the same gla to taxi driver they oso can cheong
 ok i am not sure which suv chiu are comparing ,  it has to be apple to apple ,  if chiu compare gla with glc or gle then of course not apple to apple .
 top up a bit get nissan gtr
 i remember  just last year .
 we were talking about pi chiu can get $114k for a gla or bmw 1
 rich not affected .
 oni the working class get the punishment .
 hi boss how are chiu  ,  yeah actually this policy seems to be like not much effect
 this is not call cooling measures more like i wanna suck more from chiu … .
 just like coe… .
 lost the meaning… .
 first time buyers not affected .
 interest rates expected to climb next year .
 for first-timers ,  this presents an opportunity to buy soon
 boss me got thursday blues .
 actually the measures should .
 have almost no effect on hdb resale prices .
 absd wont apply to hdb resale .
 no one in singapore can buy hdb as a 2nd property .
 the 90% => 85% ltv oni applies to loans from hdb .
 anyone who is stupid enough to borrow at 2 .
 6% instead of 1 .
 banks deserve to lose money on every financial transaction for the rest of their lives 
 this is oso another reason why our forests has been clearing for condo ,  easy and good money .
 in before one edmwer saay hdb too cheeep .
 85% for first time buyers is not jialat la .
 most would oredi have sufficient cpf to cover the 15% .
 this kind of caring gahmen really world class…… vote them more… .
 your future generation will thank chiu 9696…
 lolzz another lame effort .
 resale market is the real problem .
 but pap cannot offend their ceca masters  .
 listen to rubbish in edmw will make chiu poor .
 just come and do opposite to milk the cash .
 ton of reverse indicators here .
 cant wait if there is ever going to be a property meltdown 
 time to buy car and house it xmas  !
 to remove the blues
 30 percent tax  ?
 factor into listing price now  !
 3 mil flat transacting soon !
 absd too expensive to buy my fourth property  .
 pr first property remains at 5% .
 this is the crucial one they fail to address .
 most prs like msians and pinoys oni buy 1 hdb to lease out later ,  then sell for profit ,  5% cannot stop them
 so pr buy hdb need absd ?
 gahmem just wanna recoup more money in disguise of lowering property prices .
 pb cause by over depending on foreignor workers .
  now backfire ,  gahment huat more  .
 gd or bad both huat .
 says report on bloomberg .
 i think people are ignoring how hard it is to get a pr overseas in some of the countries discussed .
  sure japan is nice ,  but how is a typical sinkie going to get a visa to retire there ?
  even in thailand ,  i see many angmo making visa runs leaving the country every 90 days to get new visa - very pain in the ass .
  at least with the cheena visa ,  chiu can stay five years at a time .
  if chiu got money ,  anywhere oso can retire but typical sinkie probably can oni qualify for thailand ,  mm2h (if they ever bring back the program) and pinoy land .
  cheena visa for oversea chinese is a good alternative to these options .
 oso ,  to be honest ,  having lived overseas for some time ,  food option is oso a major consideration on where to live for me .
  we live in singapore with so many food options ,  so hard to replicate overseas .
  go small cities ,  very limited choices .
  even bigger cities hard to true singapore food and hard to find good malay and indian food option .
  even in cheena food is so different from region to region .
 this visa is mainly for those who have concrete documentation .
 its designed for those whose parents were previously chinese citizens to begin with .
 they have more than ample proof .
 i have never heard of any sinkie getting this descent visa .
 the best chiu can do is probably a 1 year multiple re-entry visa .
 if chiu are american or british ,  then a 10-yr multi entry visa is open to chiu .
 cb singapore should merge with malaysia la to fulfill the old man wishes
 after the zhengzhou flood
 most sinkies are scared to go to cheena on their own .
 tell them to buy a train ticket to go from one city to another ,  they are scared .
 i dunno what is in their mind .
  lack of confidence in speaking putonghua purely with no engrish added ?
  scared to get lost in a big country with so many cities in all different directions ?
  scared of being robbed ,  kidnapped or murdered ?
   liddat ,  how to retire in cheena ?
 haha this comment made my day ,  but new zealand is hard game .
 unless chiu have few million for investor visa
 covid going to be around for a while .
 stay put first .
 if chiu and your wife have a combined income of $10k ,  chiu are quite well off .
  jiak dtf ,  jiak kfc cheekon ,  drink bbt ,  no problem .
 but if chiu merge your family with your neighbor .
 they have  2 adults 6 kids ,  and a household income of $3500 ,  so it becomes 10 people now sharing $13 , 500 ,  it will not make them rich but make chiu poor .
 if want merger ,  the most i can agree to is merging with jb .
 not whole of johor .
  but jb is part of johor ,  it &apos;s the capital of johor ,  and the sultan will want to be our monarch .
  the devil is in the details ,  how to work things out .
 if younger ,  ok .
 but elderly very tiring .
 just lease 999-years the johor land to the east of singapore below the river cutting across it ,  pay off the locals to piss off .
 now chiu have industrial land ,  farms and a port and a place to put thaad radar .
 suck commie cock or get sent to conc camp
 to retire in cheena ,  oni possible if your spouse is a prc .
 my cousin married one and the whole family is now living in cheena .
 for true blue sinkies who are so used to singapore lifestyle ,  dont think we can retire there .
  the queue cutting ,  loud chatter can be quite unbearable ,  not to mention food and air quality .
 go there for a short holiday should be fine .
 it’s very safe to travel around .
 no need to worry about being mugged or racist attacks like in other countries .
 think taiwan might be a better choice for            me .
 hope the cost of living there for s lower than prc tier 2 or 3 cities .
 ccp watch every single sheet chiu do .
 go pang sai oso they know .
 ts is no different from ceca who come here to suck our country dry then retire elsewhere .
 rich enough oso can retire in cheena .
 when i think of retirement it’s a lifestyle of staying a few months in another city or cities a year .
 almost like an extended holiday .
 but once you’ve chronic disease or when chiu find it hard to move around ,  it’s time to return to singapore to have your children around to care for chiu .
 alot of old folks dont mind going back to our ancestral home town
 big cities and towns not a problem at all ,  as long as got money and practice common sense .
 oni get problem when i go to those super ulu village places .

 no more 5 day mc ?
 it doesnt really work if the virus imports keep pouring in .
 patient zeros keep increasing and u will have a never ending cycle
 they are trying their best to delay closing borders ,  come up with more and more ridiculous demands .
 think she is garment slug
 tray return is most important law in singapore after chewing gum .
 civid is nothing to do
 speeding has point deduction right ?
 shes the one who stir until got tray return rules .
 cos tray return is pet policy of some minister  .
 die die must make sure succeed
 of course i think our traffic rules r a joke .
 no license drive veh ,  bar from driving .
 straight away go jail ok .
 no license drive ,  u think they hiew the license ban ?
 not making sense
 cos uniquely singapore .
 oei diana don’t liddat leh ,  now chiu give them more idea to raise speeding penalties liao .
 if the penalty for a crime is a fine ,  then that law oni exists for the lower class .
 u can not return tray as many times as u like and never get banned from hawker center .
 if u speed a few times your licence gone case liao lock and bend .
 voting for diana ser !
 people who can afford a car ,  what is $150 to them ?
 it should start in the range of $1000 and not just implement ,  enforce it !
 repeated offence should be jailed too !
 i watched the program and was disappointed .
 it became the mouth piece to suck it up to the stupid policy .
 and they got a hawker to become calefare to clap for it .
 answer is simple .
 $300 fine for an action that low ses folks are likely to commit .
 $150 lower fine for a crime that elites are likely to commit with their fast cars .
 than bondage her
 cos drivers tend to be from  &apos;good family &apos; ?
 should just implement social credit system .
 no return tray ,  chiu cant take taxi or airplanes next time .
 average slug ,  got boob no brain
 surprised that it’s not $500 .
 oredi have folks who shout loud loud when caught ,  have $300 ,  can pay .
 same as wear masks .
 maybe later become must have vaccine ,  must have booster
 dabao leave food on the tables will kena fine as well ?
 what about the expected harm caused by one case of speeding vs one case of not returning tray
 singapore - anyone who feels ill should see a doctor immediately and should not go to school or work ,  education minister lawrence wong said on friday (may 14) .
  &apos;we should remind everyone .
 so long as chiu feel sick ,  if chiu are not feeling well ,  please do not go to school ,  do not go to work .
 report sick ,  go and see a doctor immediately ,  and in the meantime ,  isolate yourself ,  &apos; he said .
 mr wong ,  who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force on covid ,  said at a press conference that recent cases have shown that the spread of the virus can be contained if those who fall ill get medical help quickly .
  &apos;when people do that very promptly ,  they are able to limit the spread of the virus so it doesnt go on to other settings .
 it &apos;s confined to themselves and maybe to one or two other people in the household ,  and therefore it stops the spread of the virus very quickly ,  &apos; he said .
 he added:  &apos;on the other hand ,  we have seen cases where people feel sick .
 they may even have a fever ,  but they continue going to work and oni see the doctor later on .
  &apos;unfortunately ,  when this happens ,  the virus would have spread to many other people ,  be it at work or in other settings .
 see doc need $$ .
 no work = no $$ .
 who give us $$ ?
 if kena mc ,  how to explain to boss .
 say until so easy .
 saying is one thing .
 if we keep getting 5 days mc  ,  it surely will jeopardise our work  .
 what will my company think of my work antic  .
 talking comes cheap for them to say
 5 days mc oni works for so much until the bubble burst .
 just stop the bl00dy imports la !
 self employed persons how ?
 they must up the rules that those stationed outside of scan area shouldn’t just use eye power .
 need to check mask wear correctly or not .
 if outside oredi not wearing correctly then denied entry until they come back with a better mask .
 employ more people .
 those that sounds with running nose sound all strictly rejected n note down numbers .
 plenty of sick cats going out one
 then tio mark by boss for taking too many mc
 ok then spread to co lo
 will gahment foot the bill ?
 else we call this privatized costs for sinkies ,  socialized benefit for gahment .
 everything oso tell us do quickly .
 we tell them shut border quickly they do it like liang po po and yet never shut .
  &apos;when people promptly close their legs ,  the changes of std is reduced to zero ,  obviously .
  &apos;on the other hand ,  if knowingly keep their legs open indiscriminately ,  chiu can expect to see a cauliflower sprout .
  &apos;unfortunately ,  when this happens ,  chiu get what chiu deserve .
 chiu shouldn &apos;t be blaming anybody else .
 next rule will be next time if kena covid n tio check sick never see doc will kena fine lol
 get tested is free ah ?
 i just got tested by company sponsor ,  it &apos;s $200
 i arm cheo at the comments .
 ok say ,  the lady is correct .
 so the water heater is $250 and she is paying $3150 for someone to install swee swee the water heater for her .
 without knowing the condition of her water pipe and electricity slot at home ,  will chiu dare to install it plus ensure after sales service and responsibility that no one get short circuited with the $3150 ?
 take bus / mrt from woodlands to town is about $2 by bus/mrt .
 but take taxi/grab is $20+ .
 10 times more expensive but those that take taxi/grab got say is tok $$$ ?
 water heart is $250 .
 the company sell her full service install and all (we not sure what condition the electricity and plumbing was in) and charge her $3k+ and she know beforehand the amt ,  why she still say yes  ?
 oso ,  part time freelancer do vs company do is different .
 yes ,  i can get jhk install $30 oso got .
 but what if the installation not done properly ?
 if local singapore company ,  at least can sue for poor worksmanship .
 but if chiu ask me is the company overcharging ?
 of course is overcharging la .
 the lady should have rejected or at least research more before agree before complaining .
 3k can change toilet bowl and bathtub liao .
 whole bathroom/toilet makeover
 from my personal experience .
 never ever use those 1st google search result or paid adverts website advertising rhese so called house services .
 never trust jhk even if they claim to be freelance or by  &apos;recommendation &apos; by your jh frens .
 they will still chop chiu carrot no matter whether is intro by their friend or anything .
 gave me shoddy job and still dare to charge premium price .
 heng mine was oni 1 .
 5x more than market .
 but lesson learnt was more valuable .
 1 day just take on 1 job is enough .
 if do a few jobs a day ,  plus do weekends and holidays ,  sure can hit a few mil a year !
 simi lan sai oso crowdfund .
 from raybe to this .
 go help those elderly working as cleaners at hawker centres better la .
 did case do anything ?
 gahmen too lazy to go regulate these industries .
 just say free market pricing sua .
 spoil market is charge less .
 his competitors should be happy .
 all can increase price liao
 the correct question is does case ever do anything ?
 if not how to drive big cars
 make $$ no noise .
 loss money kpkb .
 no offend to fnb owner here
 if they cannot survive ,  close it down for all i care .
 if they know how to mgt $$ ,  dont think they will close down so fast .
 i saw that part about 5% profits .
 chiu think uncle just come out of school ?
 the bulk of it goes to feeding the greedy landlord and the rest is creative accounting before submitting for taxes
 they no save up for rainy days ?
 i really almost believe it is 5% based on what he says
 some earn some dont
 the prc hokkien mee seller at the coffeeshop near my house still have long queue ,  mark up price ,  give lesser ingredients ,  have gahment subsidy .
 i think he huat during the pandemic .
 funny thing is my area keep opening new cafes wor .
 like not scared circuit breaker one .
 gahment dunnid to help them .
 last friday evening mitsuba at clarke quay is full house leh .
 where is the covid .
 they are just getting attention from the sinkie so that they can dabao more from them .
 sinkie are sucker for this .
 end up the hawkers will be getting the latest edition of benz next with the price increase very soon .
 sinkie dont really think so they end up being the carrot all the time .
 they are at the bottom of the pyramid .
 if an fnb business can oni give chiu a return of 5% why waste time ?
 so many jumping head in ,  not scared head picah ?
 take for example macdonald .
 most outlets make money except for a few in the heartland but they are there for advertising and making their presence felt .
 definitely cheaper than making tv advertisement .
 why chiu think govn pushing cashless ?
 thats the best way to see books .
 i think they have to get the cashless system to work first .
 seems like it is a failure at the moment .
 do any business oso got ups & downs what  .
 some of those ,  not even in fnb ,  had fold their business for good ,  pre-covid days .
 we people on the streets ,  average joes etc have our own sets of probs to think abt
 give chiu  &apos;assistance &apos; &  &apos;grants &apos; to go cashless ?
 my nick may be so but im definitely not gong or dai 
 can make way more just sit and home and trade shares ,  .
 i think too many people have romantic notions of being a cafe owner and right now in singapore every one wants to own a cafe but do not understand the risks financial and mental
 this kind of business close down 10 years oso nevermind la .
 10 years later ,  will have many people rushing to open restorans and cafe de
 i find it weird that cheena is so much more advanced in digital transformation than india yet our gahment thinks india can bring us forward in this digital transformation rather than cheena .
 something is wrong leh .
 then get so many locals uni-educated and trained in it skills ,  still need to suck up to ceca lords ,  lol .
 to scam need to be creative .
 sinkies ten year series .
 keep follow template .
 sure lose to creative people .
 bring in their special requirements ,  refuse to hire sinkies or to train sinkies on those requirements ,  and then forever say that we are lacking and need to hire their own  ?
 indian got more sexperience with digital technology ?
 even cheena better than them 100x .
 at both real and scam technology .
 dunno why even our local businesses like india so much more than local talent or china
 on the job ,  these ceca will never train local sinkies up to speed ,  cos they need to protect their own job ,  and oso use the excuse to bring the rest of their kampong over here .
 but we are told our nus ntu always rank so high up there ,  so we  ranked up just to meet kpi oni la .
 and why cecas got experience and we do not have ?
  ,  after cecas graduated ,  they have to start out without experience oso what ?
 why cant sinkies to allowed to do the same ?
 we oso heard we boasts many mnc setting up here in singapore ,  so if they looking for experienced cecas ,  the question is how all these cecas gain the experience which sinkies cannot ?
 those in picture are construction worker we desperately need .
 otherwise bto delayed
 cheena spit out singapore oredi .
 now oni low tech industries like hdl want to come singapore
 cost over quality .
 well done pap .
 any problem over quality ?
 just blame sinkies ,  meek and subservient to pap .
 do chiu think there &apos;s a cuntry called cecapore ?
 whole world oni got tech experts in india ?
 flying in more south asians into singapore right now !
 tht &apos;s y there are job discrimination for born & breed of sinkies & other sinkies .
 refuse to train sinkies or lack of sinkies to hire with those demands .
 job discrimination = racial discrimination
 path of no return
 then why minister they dont hire from india ?
 im sure many india minister would take 1/10 of what our ministers take currently .
 just look at dbs u know .
 locals replaced by ceca .
 meanwhile ocbc backend mostly locals afaik .
 bunch of fkers justifying more means to import mutant deltas  !
 cheena oredi doing massive animation in movies and e-commerce in business while india still oni talking about it .
  like this bunch of ceos .
 who talks big .
 who can deliver .
 it is so obvious .
 can pap please read common sense advice given by edmw ?
 not correct on ocbc .
 the no of people they can mobilize macam approaching saf level .
 so have chiu done your laundry yet ?
 thank chiu captain obvious
 in angmo countries ,  sick just go phamacy get drugs ,  they never even heard of mc before .
 seeing a doctor when sick is being ignorant of the real world and its consequences .
 companies dont like people who disappear ,  even if they have valid reasons .
 going to the doctor is effectively resigning from your job ,  cos there are no laws to prevent such things if they pretend that those people suddenly have  &apos;poor performance &apos; or  &apos;attitude problem &apos; by being absent .
 more importantly ,  it completely obfuscates the reasons for community cases .
 close the borders then start worrying about community cases ,  otherwise new community cases will just keep popping up uncontrollably cos by the time it &apos;s detected ,  it &apos;s oredi too late .
 the thinking that people will oni be infectious if they have symptoms is something that is outdated and has been wrong for over a year .
 it does not work liddat .
 if diagnosed with covid ,  gahment covers the medical bill and test ,  reimburses the workers &apos; salary to the company .
 this way ,  they can weed out possible cases while company do no suffer any financial losses .
 if not covid positive ,  too bad .
 ya but now is to catch the virus n stop community spread .
 nowadays co hard to find people oso .
 take 5 days mc cannot ?
 not yet japan level in singapore .
 some even 10-20days leave lor .
 ill patients are not the main problem ,  it &apos;s the asymptomatic ones .
 asymptomatic patients very hard to detect .
 like yesterday chiu see all those positive cases from india at chennai airpork ,  all are asymptomatic .
 coupled with their  &apos;fake it till they make it &apos; culture ,  it &apos;s very hard to capture them all .
 spread to community and thats it .
 unless chiu test every resident here every week .
 in the same workplace for 6 years .
 alot of projects ,  some high profile but whenever asked boss about career growth or promotion ,  he will say cant say the plans for sure .
 just continue to do ,  wait and see .
 would chiu move to another job where u have to start building your career from scratch or stay in the same place ?
 chiu are a threat to your boss
 start when u are young… .
 once u got married ,  got kids…… .
 u wont want to risk…… .
 the boss doesn’t even know when he will tio pok himself how to promise chiu ?
 wherever chiu go ,  .
 it &apos;s the same sai .
 different colour same smell .
 it &apos;s better that chiu come to peace  .
 with this sooner rather than later .
 if u have to ask i would say no
 compare your celery with your frens who are around same age
 there is no point being loyal to your boss  .
 unless chiu just want to do the same thing day in day out ,  suggest leaving that comfortable space and seek out other opportunities for personal growth .
 with your experience ,  chiu will never be starting from scratch anyways ,  even if chiu join a new industry ,  for sure there will be something chiu can bring .
 hate to burst your bubble .
 the oni growth that chiu should care about is your salary .
 the next move is to get out of the rat race .
 the career growth is a bs fallacy to retain chiu as a rat and wage slave .
 at the end of the day ,  chiu are at the mercy of your immediate boss if chiu dont network with the higher management to find a strong backer .
 it is not sound to make any move for the next two years .
 wait till 2023 when the economy is recovered .
 build up yr resume .
 alot of project but what is yr role in them  .
 test the market with yr resume  .
 and u will know whether it is worth it to stay
 your annual pay increment ,  bonus and other benefit got grow or not ?
 if stagnant ,  just look for a better job
 how is the salary like ?
 dont ever attach yourself to a company ,  organisation ,  or a project .
 attach yourself to your purpose .
 thats the way to keep your power and peace .
 that’s why i have never wanted a job… unless 
 surprised at the good and serious answers here .
 i agree with them .
 surprised cos these answers actually came in edmw and not careers thread lol
 no recognition no talk
 when your boss doesnt micromanage and your colleagues are good .
 politics will always be there unless chiu are in a sme .
 why did u say that ?
 when chiu are taken advantage of ,  been forced to do lots of work for no additional pay
 why doesn’t he has plan for chiu ?
 chiu one day will outshine him and take over his position or be his boss if chiu are good but he wants to hide your under him
 i feel that at this current company ,  i might have started off at the wrong foot .
 like i was not very into networking so i didnt really cultivate my own network n backing .
 was thinking if i start afresh somewhere ,  i might try to be more sociable since now i realise the importance ?
 property tax increased .
 won’t affect a **** unless they raise it drastically
 looks like the rumours from earlier this year might all be true testing balloon .
 some of the other things i remember being mentioned includes longer mop and/or not allow renting of whole flats even after mop 
 good morning ,  mystyque kor kor .
 been a long time since we interacted ,  still remember me ?
 when ah kong handed out cdc vouchers ,  we should have expected it  
 buy service apartment  ,  no absd for that  ,  boss level is buy service apartment  ,  thanks me later
 temp depress ,  long run all still cheong ,  now cheong even more thanks to tax
 hosey lieow ,  can sign on third mistress oredi  .
 i think cos condos are so expensive ,  the upper middle class people that usually buy condo instead of hdb is now force fo buy a hdb .
 they can easily throw 700-1mil on a premium hdb which will drive those price up .
 then those middle class will now have to buy lower tier hdb which will drive those price up .
 these people long ago bought it liao la .
 now they can wait for a few years until rules change back lor .
 cos their combined household income make them ineligible to apply for bto for second time .
 the old  &apos;give u chicken wing take back whole cheekon &apos; trick ?
 rental income for boomers ,  work till die for millennials .
 so many gcb changed hands .
 was coming all along
 sleep some more
 why divorce will change the situation lolol
 hdb not affected much .
 dont affect most of us .
 we oni have one property .
 dont affect chiu ?
 1 property how to get rich ?
 every year singapore is in the top 5 most expensive cities fighting for number 1 leh .
 did chiu see blood in your pee ?
 dino bu as show ger carry tray around mucking food  .
 transgender as show her .

 for cost cutting ?
 up for discussion
 u want dino bu  ,  trans with or without kukujiao ,   .
 all on the menu to select the virtual model u want .
 pray for japan !
 people think japan is fun and all but dunno they are at the epicentre of many natural disasters especially earthquakes/tsunami ,  think volcano is the least of their worries
 as a retiree ,  dont think we can adjust to stay long term in cheena .
 there will be a cultural shock as the system is different .
 been to guangzhou more than 5 times free and easy as a tourist .
 very convenient and i am a cantonese ,  so communication with locals no issue .
 they treat chiu extra well if chiu speak cantonese .
 anyway most general workers there are non resident ,  so they speak putonghua more .
 but in cheena it is best that chiu have a hu koh or residence pass if staying long term to enjoy medical and special local benefits as a local .
 otherwise living expenses cost more .
 for me ,  i prefer to stay in singapore where the medical facilities are modern and accessible .
 i know how to get around and get things done fast .
 quite difficult to learn how to manage a digital cheena where everything is done via a smart phone  apps as my command of mandarin is sub standard .
 if got extra cash ,  i can travel around cheena free n easy as a tourist .
 no problem as i used to travel in my work when i was younger .
 in cheena it &apos;s all about contacts .
 my friend in bj had a fever ,  when to local hospital ,  had to wait till was asked to come back next day !
 another knows people in the hospital ,  jumped queue and went straight to specialist .
 in cheena ,  if chiu want singapore style medical treatment and doesnt have contacts ,  get international class insurance (be prepared to pay at least 4k sgd for a year .
 however if chiu are to compare to us ,  at least one can have affordable healthcare services in cheena .
 in us ,  affordable healthcare means self medicate .
 not sure which chiu will prefer .
 all about contacts and money .
 i was lucky cause my contact knew the system and people in the hospital .
 after he pushed me to the front ,  the small fries gp/missy knew him so i got it easy .
 when i first reached there really blur(contact was parking car) .
 it wasent really cheap by the way ,  xray plus drip and gp cost me almost 100sgd .
 before olympics was s shiok ,  just show passport immediate vip treatment .
 now no more liao .
 the one treatment they always use ,  is to put patients on drips .
 there &apos;s a major con to having drips oni as treatment when chiu are sick .
  i forgot what it is exactly .
  something about your immune weakening or your body not reacting to other medicines in future .
 something along the line .
 there are different kind of drips .
 thats why the doctor will say must finish the antibiotics ,  else next time the virus will be immune to the  antibiotics .
 same reason why we should not change doctors too much ,  cause the doctors will know which type of medicine to give you
 i am comparing it to glc and nx .
 dont see what &apos;s wrong .
 chiu gla owner ah
 i would say is a complete driving experience .
 if buying of car is as simple as comparing the bhp ,  nm ,  0-100 .
 then it is just paper exercise ,  no meaning at all .
 i am not gla owner .
 but if chiu want to compare it has to be apple to apple .
 same price range what comfort chiu can get .
 how can someone pay $180k expect the same comfort as glc that may cost $250k now ?
 top up a bit get ateca cupra .
 in down under ,  amg gla45s with tax goes for aud107 , 035 .
 got mine at mid 180s as mentioned earlier la 
 glc not so expensive ,  but ok i get your point .
 macan s or gla45s ?
 the perceived value of porsche is higher than merc .
 keyboard warriors come in
 glc coupe oredi at $300k range ,  not expensive ?
 just get the glb instead lol
 i &apos;d go for a cupra formentor instead .
 give a call to c&c showroom tomorrow .
 that’s why chiu don’t even see them advertise this call any more .
 no stock how to sell !
 that car design really make me feel like a hearse .
 but during the first weekend of launch ,  c&c sold more than 100 units .
 might as well buy kia
 buy high sell low is the way
 might as well speeding straight away death penalty la .
 perhaps the idiot who came up with this policy can have the courtesy to explain to her
 one of the best laws to come in years .
 can see so many clean and avaliable tables now in hawker .
 diana ser is a good host but not a good actress .
 i remember she was not popular during tcs era .
 her hubby james lye can act very well .
 speeding ,  drunk drive ,  causing gervious injury and deaths ,  yet the sentencing and fine is  ,  i bet ,  1st in the world ,  super light sentence .
 i bet our police really support drunk drivers .
 cos one for low ses another for high ses .
 drive over bicycle like tree branch oso light punishment
 the law very super soft towards those speeder .
 there are great mechanism to catch speeding .
 there arent so good ones to catch non tray returns .
 to meet their kpi .
 jury is still out .
 with the dine in restriction .
 wait for full relaxation of rules then say .
 diana ser promoted tray return ,  say wont cause cleaners be fired .
 now cleaners are fired .
 these mass media not paid to use brain ,  they take funding and direction from papy gahment .
 implying her family has no car and jiak hc 
 why white collar crime do longer jailtime than killing crime ?
 she will push until every fine is above $10k
 diana is the one that says .
 clean up in hawker centers wont make cleaners lose jobs .
 but for this case ,  i support her .
 speeding and dangerous driving should be fine at least $1 , 000 and above .
 it will cut away at least half of the bengsters who are poor .
 the other half who are rich  .
 u still need the jail term to settle that .
 but it willl make the road a very pleasant and safe place to drive .
 while yoiu are it ,  can chiu oso fine the cyclists $1 , 000 for riding illegally on the expressway .
 i would like to implement this rules to those pap mps n ministers  .
 those speeding causing deaths n gracious injuries and us convicted: .
 ban driving for life .
 compensate to the deceased family or injured victims .
 3 and 4 up to mps to decides .
 she never wonder vehicular man slaughter few weeks jail
 cos here like to punish for small little things even if it doesnt cause any actual harm .
 punishment is the way of living in singapore .
 dont return then dont eat at hawker .
 even if racks fulls of returns ,  still better than all over the tables .
 nothing further to say
 non returning tray(s) can generate more infinite “revenue” mah
 say rain in afternoon .
 sell the 5000 btc u hold .
 ask minister to meet u and u throw the money in his face to show u have more dignity than them
 sounds like gahmen $$$ not enuf sia !
 gahment should impose 10% for pr n 20% for foreigner on 1st purchase
 still thinking of milking us millennial some more la !
 knn jolly well keep your farking resale prices low !
 if not gahment impose even more cooling measures for u owners to shiit bricks !
 the rich are buying up shop houses or landed to convert them to service apartment  ,  small scale like 10 rooms and such selling at around 12 m ,  can avoid absd ,  treat me kopi next time ,  why chiu even buy individual condo at 1-3 m ,  when chiu can built your own 10 plus unit at much lesser cost
 hi boss how are chiu ?
 do chiu miss me ?
 fark the pap mens
 infra & system dont come free .
 each transaction maybe 1% .
 $5 food ,  will take about 5c .
 terminal ,  phoneline ,  services etc .
 are another bulk of (additional) cost .
 hawkers will be easier to be checked on their books oso after going cashless .
 not going to support them leh
 issue is all these wont last forever .
 maybe a year ,  once you &apos;re onboard ,  how to go offboard ?
 you &apos;ll have to pay whatever extorbitant pricing that comes along next .
 the croonies want to earn but dont want to pay .
 whenever i see the media report about 20 year old restaurant closing down cos a few months of losing money ,  i will sleep well .
 20 years earn money 9696 but a few months cannot tahan
 5 years with no end in sight .
  many have closed .
  some still hanging on .
  some make even more money .
 it depends on who chiu interview .
 not all fnb making lost .
 u see the king of fried rice .
 open new outlet at safra gombak .
 there another chee cheong fun oso opening a new branch in coffee shop soon .
 it &apos;s just like buying a car ,  they mandate chiu have to go for inspection ,  but chiu have to pay for inspection .
 not all fnb earn big money during precovid times .
 and those are the one that cant survive
 chiu got job oso dont make noise ,  no job come here kpkb ,  no ?
 so many huat until no tomorrow .
 how come this report ?
 let &apos;s take a look at their networth ,  the houses they live in and the cars they drive while interviewing them
 should be sobbing in their benz with a glass of red wine .
 far esat still charged full rental .
 poor marketing  .
 look at secretlab selling gcbs n yachts .
 new yacht comission
 there &apos;s too much f&b in singapore anyway .
 your grandfather money ah ?
 these measures make it clear that if a married couple is thinking of using property as a pillar to support retirement ,  the oni way to go is decoupling and buy 2 pte properties separately .
 otherwise the absd mountain is too steep .
 more demand than supply i mean .
 if one cant afford to buy ,  they rent .
 what is correct ?
 ceca talents jaiho !
 thank chiu ceca !
 that daviddtw ,  his company oso using java .
 i wonder why our local uni/polys cannot churn out it grads with the right skills then ?
 oso tio infiltrated by ceca ?
 should see if shoppee and grab mostly ceca or what .
 its the western mncs  that want ceca .
 check with that ben leong .
 ceca insulting nus
 the commonality amongst these ceo .
 1) of certain south asian descent .
 2) set up company in singapore to get the project .
 3) hire cheap labor from india .
 4) then to maximise profit ,  jjww say sinkies expensive n inexperience .
 maybe he never teach java to our uni students la ?
 amongst the 3 local banks i can oni say that the statement is true for uob
 pap policy wan sui
 india is the motherland of singapore ?
 roll out the red carpet to welcome them .
 what history of work on complex tech projects do they have in india ?
 do they have some homegrown fb ,  google equivalent that they are keeping in stealth mode from the world ?
 pretty shameless boast there .
 now i know our  &apos;world crass education system &apos; is teaching junk .
 u think tiongkok still wan to work in dead-end sinkiland tech when alibaba ,  tencent ,  and many other startups hire en masse ?
 the salary back home can be higher hor; and if dey stay here dey doing low level tech jod
 sinkies no experience ?
 then train them .
 dont train them ?
 then in future forever no sinkies will have experience to do it .
 forever addicted to fts
 just as cheena is motherland of hongkong ,  gateway to cheena .
 india is motherland to sinkiland ,  gateway to india
 y train an expensive sinkie when u can hire someone immediately from your village with some experience  ?
 who will uplorry first ?
 who will live long enough to be rescued ?
 chiu not scared kena charsiew inside
 of mercedes suvs ,  i quite llike glc
 glc should be cannibilized by glbs bah .
  looks almost the same .
  and glbs are actually more spacious inside i think .
 lucky i bought the glc coupe .
 5tsi unit oni 1k above gla180  
 i think can system 3 if have lobang .
 what era oredi ?
 people quote $3000 she immediately agree and won’t go search for alternative quotes herself ?
 she urgently need to shower ?
 one simple carousell or google search can easily find 5 other vendors to check with .
 granted ,  the guy quoted way above the normal price ,  but he oso didn’t put a knife to her neck and force her to accept what .
 when my previous car was overheating i oso got quoted $3k by a random cb workshop ,  i oso walked away and got it fixed for $500 at a reputable place .
 some people here are really hypocritical .
 to them if the person doesnt know the price ,  it is perfectly ok for the merchant to chop her gao gao .
 no problem at all !
 incidentally these are the same people who lowball others gao gao on carouhell or cry murder when they get overcharged by a few dollars .
 this type will kena boycott jialat jialat
 customer may be at fault for not checking on the cost before agreeing to pay .
 but company is unscrupulous to take advantage of customer &apos;s predicament/ignorance .
 it &apos;s good that this customer raised it for public awareness - help warn any clueless potential customer against such unscrupulous company .
 case as usual ,  is useless .
 they collect membership fees .
 please sign up for life member to complain more
 let &apos;s all place order and mia  !
 he told papers he kena nuisance calls and oredi report police
 ntuc home service  safer .
 at least can complain to ntuc
 will just closed and open another coy lo
 dishonorable son oso keep insisting he is not dishonorable
 she dare to challenge law minister ?
 probably the elites feel bored and enjoy tekaning peasants like in the squid game
 lau bimbo too free got nothing better to do harp on tray return
 they want to impress the foreigners and tourists .
 thats why the harsh law on tray return .
 look ,  chiu want to impress tourists and let the tourists have a better environment to dine that is no wrong .
 but the wrong thing is chiu make it into a harsh law when chiu know our tourists numbers are actually booming through the years (excluding covid period) even without the tray return law .
 what is the point of the tray return policy ?
 i dont see food prices dropping or hawker stall rents dropping .
 so the oni reason i can think of is to impress the tourists influx after the covid .
 and chiu really believe these cleaning companies wont fire some old folks ?
 the dynamics of economy ,  dont forget .
 i think diana is beginning to see why netizens kpkb about the tray return policy in the first place .
 quoted by diana ser .
 so who &apos;s the source ?
 this cb is the one who said auntie won’t lose their jobs one
 cos oni peasants will eat at hawker center and return tray while high ses people  speed around with their cars as entertainment .
 speeding 3rd offence sgd$10 , 000 + revoke driving licence + banned from driving next 10 years even if retake driving licence test and pass .
 speed or not ,  nobody will earn less or more .
 tray return or not ,  somebody will definitely earn less .
 fck the bui bui edmwers who are against it 
 another reason maybe doesnt want to let tourists see 1st world city as  &apos;claimed &apos; have so many elderly working as cleaners .
 yes ,  chiu got that right ,  agree !
 if this thing she stir and pull through all those sports cars super cars owners can sell their junk or scrap it away sua
 not the other way round meh ?
 heard last time she did not came from leech background .
 very clever girl one
 who did u vote for ?
 traffic offences not within minister kpi ,  while tray return is .
 shes still a good fcuk at 50 .
 dl and can maintain
 this will be the key for next election how the 61% will drop to 48%
 chiu should watch the whole show .
 this portion is just part of the wayang .
 8 years enough ?
 he has ruined the next generation of his .
 it appears prison services are more friendly nowadays .
 seems like going prison is super fun and relaxing .
 more to rehabilitative training .
 his next generation is harmed .
 now 11 families get harmed .
 imagine the multiplier effect on society
 knn why chiu macham talking to yourself one
 i just thought 8 years was a joke .
 if such cases were endemic ,  must as well just ask the man to serve stay home notice .
 let free back to society .
 it &apos;s not one or two girls .
 how can say trick ,  both willing leh ,  .
 who &apos;s to say he not feeling out business    .
 the girls he feel out all oso sluts want easy money .
 how is 11 girls and serving 8 years justifiable ?
 u asked for the society u want to see in the next 5 years .
 continue with slut shaming .
 lape 11 girls so many ah ,  how he do it my idol sia
 how will society ever learn ?
 if one man can commit crime ,  it means all men are oso able to commit the same crime .
 is there enough discussion on the ground ?
 are the lessons never enough from all the existing cases ?
 how will his life in prison be ?
 it appears he shall be kept in four walls ,  fed daily with enough rest and sleep every day
 this brings up the issue of sacking of raeesah khan .
 will singapore edison chen version ever stop ?
 we are not even seeing edison chen .
 we are seeing normal folks like this guy .
 how endemic is the situation ?
 really self pwn sia 
 better lock him up forever .
 they are sluts what
 how come no sauce one ?
 how are teachers conveying such topics to the kids in school ?
 how are parents talking to their kids on these matters ?
 chiu can start in current company too .
 sure chiu will find a breakthrough somehow someday
 i would say i am slightly above .
 money is not really the biggest issue - it &apos;s more of the recognition n appreciation which i am not feeling
 but oni once .
 and remember the sai is the same so chiu must .
 endure whatever sai thrown at chiu .
 and next time ,  oso remember to play .
 chiu don’t play chiu lose out .
 try to find a way to his boss
 sad to say ,  certain things chiu learn it too late .
 if ts is too young ,  he may not understand what i am saying .
 times have changed .
 planning your escape route is more important than planning your career .
 your career is out of your control most of the time unless your network skill is gao gao .
 standard farming procedure applies for non scholars  .
 3 years 1 time if average .
 in gahment / public sector .
 6 years should promote twice ,  if 3 years no promote can jump sheep
 come think of it is ts a civil service guy
 married but no kids .
 dont think we want any 
 in pte it is  &apos;faster &apos; if u can perform but still if cannot promote within 3 oso cui oredi 
 yea ,  thanks for reminding of the unstable situation we are in .
 actually want to jump ship since last year then covid happened 
 just start applying for jobs and see how much they offer .
 dont have to accept .
 see the market rate and compare against your salary
 last time used to be members in the project but this year i led quite a few cos boss wans to see how i handle the team members under my charge .
 the job situation is pretty shaky everywhere .
 if your company can weather the storm till 2023 ,  stay part and tahan the no promotion for these two years .
 your boss may just want to keep chiu by his side to help him clock his kpi .
 chiu can still go for interview and learn about what the other companies are doing .
 maybe it is oso a good time to plan for your escape from the rat race .
 no pay increment no bonus i will resign straight away .
 means the boss dont value chiu .
 salary not too bad la .
 if i stay put and dont do any extra project ,  i can focus on my investment actually .
 just that now in the current place ,  people oredi have this impression that i can help them to  &apos;tank &apos; stuff ,  so all the difficult projects will fall into my hands .
 thats why thinking of starting from scratch where i will spend more time networking rather than  &apos;doing &apos; work ,  since that seems to be the best way to work from my observation .
 got good got bad .
 but even good ones ,  i am not close with them .
 just treat most of them as lunch kakis - talk superficial stuff so that i dont come across as unfriendly .
 within 3 years ?
 never treat colleagues as friends .
 no matter how good they are .
 colleagues are colleagues .
 friends are friends .
 colleagues perform a very specific function  .
 within a specific time period in a  .
 that’s why they’re colleagues .
 don’t get too emotional and throw yourself  .
 into it or you’ll get burnt without realising .
 if your boss has no plan for chiu ,  u have no future under him .
 if your boss don’t help to push chiu up ,  who will help chiu ?
 chiu have work experience ,  so not really starting from scratch at another place .
 since u say u don’t have much networking here ,  and your boss don’t seem to value u ,  u have nothing much to lose here .
 can consider looking around .
 after next bonus/promotion cycle ,  if not satisfactory ,  can consider to leave after chiu secure a job .
 that why i think the boss think ts is a threat
 rise & shine liao  .
 go downstairs get this 1-4-1 deal liao  .
 upload pics free
 re u to first page
 why stop when chiu can do more to increase revenue  ?
 so what’s the point of signing he ceca deal ?
 cecas no need drink water in singapore ,  bath once in a year with ganges holee water brought from their talent and cow dung surplus home .
 5 million condo they oso no need use electricity de .
 burn candles and cook with cow dung fuel niah .
 so they no compete increase price and electricity with sinkies de .
 their ramesh’s $66k pay cheque all never use to compete for prices with sinkies de .
 all money earned in cecapore all leemmited to build up their villages niah .
 so ah loong signed ceca is to benefits shitizens niah .
 if not why sign orrhh ?
 for leeching’s geedeepee bonus meh ?
 cannot be la .
 loong’s the most honorable peem in singapore loongest history loh .

 what has electricity tariff and gst gotta to with some foreign agreements ?
 huats does ceca blings in mores monnies gottas dos with increasings fares and fees ?
 cans pwns sinkies in multiples ways  .
 huais stops ats 1 ?
 cos oreadi benefited .
 sho now earning back from stinkies rohz .
 sorry ,  if chiu ever works with them ,  they will make a simple project very complex .
 maybe that the kind of  &apos;complex &apos; project he is talking about .
 solve the problem of shittting on the streets first before tackling anything else la dey .
 attitude is different .
 sinkies well known to be damn honest .
 my coy recently engaged a ceca coy to do a big firmwide it project .
 after done liao ,  senior management all regretted their choice .
 say many problems after project completed ,  it was worse than not going with the tech infra upgrade .
 this coy somemore got many records of fark up completed projects ,  including 1 big ceca gahment project which resulted in like 5 years delay from expected completion due to time spent in resolving all the bugs in their completed it project .
 i just arm chio .
 1 quality = 1 price .
 they dont want to engage angmo coy to do cos too expensive even though with many proven success record .
 these are typical ceca .
 smoking ,  lying and always think they are good ,  and look down on others .
 once u work with them u will know .
 pap calling them ft and talking down on locals makes things worse .
 ahneh talk for ahnehs ?
 all these sbakes are really showing colours
 your coy went with lowest quote siboh ?
 india doesnt automatically mean everything good ,  oso got good n bad mah .
 all companies are setting up in india including dbs
 which means singapore education system last few decades is kenasai
 i thought we had a wonderful education system ?
  and if we dont ,  then whose fault is it ?
 and instead of fixing it ,  we just import ?
 really sai though and through
 nus and ntu &apos;s world class rankings is a joke and that the education system of singapore is worse than india .
 for all their boasting ,  moe should be ashamed .
 the minister of education has a responsibility to come out and explain this matter to the people of singapore .
 indians are the most talentless fuckers in the world .
 i would argue even worse than pinoys .
 their resume and cover letter can write until got dragon got tiger ,  but their abilities are beyond hope .
 i was recently given the opportunity to hire someone ,  i dont even bother reading the resume of those indians ,  immediately delete .
 this is a racist n xenophobic view .
 many tech companies when interviewing have coding test
 our rankings r world class not cos we have world class education ,  but cos we hire word class foren talen to churn out journal papers; .
 most of our graduates are peasants working in peasant roles; we should be proud that we r throwing money to score hign in citation rankings for academic purposes oni to game the rankings
 that guy is totally wrong .
 blockchain ,  data engineering and machine learning are not higher level skills .
 he hasn &apos;t seen enough complex engineering work .
 it &apos;s the c guys again .
 i am wondering why fake degrees can be better than sinkies ntu and nus
 it all started when our hdb are allowed to be one of source to hedge extra money… .
 this starts the ball rolling for cost of living to increase gradually… .
 if we have strict control on hdb ownership to avoid citizens to reap monetary values from selling them…growth of cost of living could be more gradual .
 this will indirectly reduced the qty of property agents… .
 many of my peers who are previously worked as engineers ,  joined the banking ,  property sectors 10 yrs back… .
 and then the shortage of engineering may not be one reason to get from overseas… .
 finally ,  if hr management position should be strictly allocated to sinkie oni ,  then it might oso put one small obstacles for those who strongly push for importing talents… .
 what u guys think ?
 ceca got uptron and spu degrees .
 local got what ?
 nus / ntu / smu degrees all useless
 u put your finger inside and it feels really good .
 what will u do ?
 shouldn &apos;t chiu be the rude 1 since it is last day of work ?
 oni reflect badly on the boss .
 so dont be too bothered by it .
 i m good friends with all my ex bosses .
 but not colleagues
 then just sabo him back lor
 usually last day of work where got hiew lan manager .
 go happy lunch with soon to be ex colleagues liao lor .
 but got joker just mia after tender and don’t even bother to do handover until asked specifically
 why should it bother u .
 till the very last min still asking moi to stay
 what did your boss do ?
 over liao ,  still care for what ?
 moi very happily my last day .
 gimme free food and tell me good luck
 oni stupid bosses do that .
 last day what do chiu need to do ?
 come in at 10 ,  see hr for exit interview ,  return laptop ,  pass ,  keys ,  name cards to admin ,  ciao at 11 .
 no reason to see boss .
 not all the places ba .
 sometimes need u to do handover or teach newbie .
 some places ,  the manager/boss wont even turn up at work or will find excuses to be elsewhere in order to avoid chiu on your last day
 i dont understand this type of  &apos;disappearance &apos; on your last day .
 what does that mean  ?
 too sad to see chiu leave or just hope never to see chiu again  ?
 simple well wish like  &apos;all the best &apos; ,  etc oso dont give  ?
 then the place really not worth to work in .
 when chiu leesgn ,  most likely the boss will no give face to chiu liao .
 last time my manager quite cheesepie .
 he tried to retain me then fail ,  then on my last day ask me ownself tell hr i resign and prepare the necessary admin stuff .
 the moment he did that i dulan ,  then i decided everything never handover ,  just say i busy with hr admin stuff for whole day and left on the dot 530pm .
 [shot after getting deleted]
 so im not the oni one who realised this and thinks the same  
 if not wonder why the ahbeng be white knight .
 dunno y got people stare at me
 library is not airport 
 stomp thems for starings at chius 
 my friend has fecal breath so he carries toothbrush and toothpaste wherever he goes .
 after eating anything he will go brush his teeth
 always see people brushing teeth in toilets so nothing new
 nothing wrong leh ,  as long as dont take too long hog the sink .
 nothing wrong ,  just like chiu want to have your breakfast while on the public toilet wc .
 this one might be due to his digestive system .
 brush teeth will oni solve the problem temporarily .
 do most libraries have toilets ?
 i oni know tpy one have .
 hide inside cubicle brush lor .
 can shun bian poot poot
 after reading some books i worry the smell of books will go into my mouth 
 nothing wrong ,  i see people brush teeth at paragon .
 just that i rather brush teeth when no one around ,  a bit paiseh .
 why so sensitive ?
 i used to brush in public toilets before wuhan too .
 never noticed anyone staring .
 my office toilet oso same problem .
  a certain race will always occupy the sinks brushing teeth after lunch .
  so much hassle that i have a routine to use another department toilet after lunch .
  yes ,   chiu want to save your dental money ,  so just use listerine and get over it .
  public toilet are for public sharing .
  yes ,  i will look at chiu and think  &apos;such inconsideration &apos;
 i think these pharmco diluted their vaccine to profit from this pandemic .
 thats why got two dose and now third dose  and yearly dose scam .
 wow ,  not 4 but 40 leh .
 these jiuhu health worker really not easy despite all precaution
 malaysia uses mainly sinovac .
 i dont if they use it for their healthcare workers though .
 why is the most important piece of detail left out ?
 which vaccine did these heathcare workers take ?
 pandemic raging on .
 instead of helping one another to combat this disease .
 yet some place some where .
 people still fighting over land and plotting to kill one another .
 should be sinovac .
  did they speak in mandarin ?
 sinovac is really hoarding n wasting precious vaccine raw materials that could be diverted to other production to make trash for the world .
 lanjiao public good 
 can i know does your aos smith digital storage tank save any money as compare to others ?
 today wanbao says contractor refunded 2 , 700
 probably feels guilty .
 650 is still pretty ex .
 appears that heater at most 300 .
 labour at most 200 if uncomplicated .
 2k is exorbitant .
 will still boycott this entrepreneur
 he better register a new company name .
 oridi smelly liao
 return 2700 so in the end charge 650 .
 seems like decent although still a bit high price .
 and all jokers in this thread still defending this scammer
 650 can buy aos bath heater with installation le .
 i checked before .
 the cheapest model with installation is about $600
 aos is good brand ?
 how much electricity u saved with this ao smith digital bath ?
 3k can buy system 2 aircon liao leh lol
 alamak so no more sagat ?
 thought will see something like jover chew type of plot .
 netizen 1  ,  farking idiot 0 .
 should blacklist this mf company .
 i think he can close shop forever .
 who is the judge ?
 don’t tell me yong pung how came back .
 it &apos;s not even edison chen and celebrities .
 anyone is culpable .
 so many male prisoners .
 he can trick many of them into anal .
 imagine he can trick 8 or more of them .
 this guy macham enter duck house
 no head no tail
 recruit him as okt or jav recruiter .
 this fugger should be jailed based on his name alone 
 i am a mere cyberwarrior .
 but if nothing is done ,  we can soon expect las vegas singapore .
 he has harmed 11 victims .
 their memory is vivid .
 their memory shall never go away .
 yet the man can expect 8 years free lodging and good food ?
 if we can expect one to feel unfair based on their looks alone ,  i can say we are not safe .
 we are living in a human hell .
 can one still expect an improved prison service .
 with good quality wardens and good quality time ?
 these people deserve it .
 i totally changed my mind of rehabilitation .
 what &apos;s the definition of tricked ?
 i &apos;ve not much clue to this story .
 are the victims older than 21 ?
 sinkie pwn sinkie  .
 oops sinkie actually pwn himself sinkie .
 is ok can sleep well in prison .
 ok and why is it tricked ?
 im asking a serious question .
 prisons nowadays are laden with corrective regimes .
 gone are days where wardens can whack the shit outta the inmates .
 above is my guess .
 any recount of factual information is not guaranteed .
 no head no tail .
 what did this guy do ?
 impersonate rich guy to have sex with women ?
 these 11 ,    sluts are prosituting themselves too .
 i think they dont even bat an eyelid
 if it aint tricked .
 then it must be willing .
 but even then ,  one is to 11 .
 is earth filled with 11 girls to 1 boy ratio ?
 dont understand why he ended up in prison for 8 years for willing parties .
 there is no context at all .
 chiu arent answering the question .
 we should go back to pre world war where one rich can marry more than he wants .
 back to subversion and domination of one species .
 yea to corrupts .
 elites dont go hawker centers
 tio covid and go outside eat bak ku teh will get harsher punishment than committing a murder next time
 next time get robots to do such shows .
 and tell her no worries ,  her job is secure
 cos elites drive car .
 but they dont eat in hawker centers .
 cos making obedient singapore return trays after meals is amy khor pet project .
 if sinkies dont return tray amy khor lose face .
 in 2019 ,  she start the project from a campaign with posters and threatening banners ,  the project failed miserably .
 so ,  2021 she forced it into a law ,  to preserve her dignity .
 this policy need alot of intelligence to implement ?
 i know the reason behind it ,  but i dont see the intelligence & depth in implementing it ,  it &apos;s just  &apos;i &apos;m the boss ,  i call the shots ,  i tell chiu to do it ,  chiu ****ing do it &apos;  .
 im pretty sure it &apos;s oso very easy to do the same for increasing our population .
 what a ****ing joke !
 tip of ice-berg in our ridiculous singapore fine /court system .
 cos elite oni eat in ivory towers and drive big cars  .
 did she wonder why picking a durian from our parks is an offence punishable with a $50 , 000 fine and/or jail ?
 did she wonder ?
 pagin for eggmy to sexplains
 it &apos;s not just about $$$ ,  thats why it &apos;s not just a fine but oso the demerit points ,  which makes a driver equal regardless of how rich or poor he/she is .
 if a person is 1 point away from losing his licence ,  how much is that 1 point worth to him if he was a taxi driver ,  vs normal guy on the street ,  vs a rich billionaire driving a ferrari ?
 to the billionaire ,  that 1 point to avoid losing his licence might be worth $100 , 000 or $1m which is spare change to him .
 this would mean that tp has to levy a $1m equivalent fine (in lieu of points) to discourage him from committing a traffic offence .
 and how would that affect the rest of the drivers ?
 on the other hand ,  if tp levies smaller fines eg $100 in lieu of points ,  the same rich driver will have a blatant disregard of traffic laws just cos he can afford it .
 hence cos traffic offences are serious violations (compared to returning trays) ,  it is never about the $ value of the fine .
  the dips system is a perfect example of how the law is blind to rich vs poor .
 every driver on the road ,  rich or poor ,  gets punished equally .
 diana &apos;s comment applies to the other examples of littering smoking etc ,  but for speeding it is like comparing an apple to an orange ,  and skews the entire perspective from her narrow lens .
 thanks for typing your views in a coherent manner .
 even with your arguments ,  the points system is still too lax .
 speeding points start at 4 .
 suspension starts at 24 points .
 technically a driver can song song speed for 5 times before act guai guai .
 oh and guess what ,  points get wiped out after 2 years on a rolling basis .
 that means if one is strategic enough ,  they can game the system quite easily .
 the first suspension period after hitting 24 points is oni for 3 farking months !
 after that ,  feel free to drive like a mad man again .
 diana is not wrong in saying our traffic penalties are too light .
 perhaps she didn’t use the right arguments but it’s not wrong .
 lastly ,  if i should remind u ,  an singapore judge once ruled that pedestrian who gets knocked down on a green man is still liable for some responsibility for getting knocked over by a car dashing red light !
 this tells u so much about which direction our traffic laws are skewed .
 i heard from my parent some cleaners no more hiring at coffee shop due to font need more as customers help to return tray .
 diam la tua neh bu
 drunk driving is really bad ,  insurance will not pay anyone .
 later they increase speeding fine lor
 chiu got see people who last time always saying hawkers v dirty la .
 people dont clean up after themselves la .
 leave plate behind la .
 is those elite one .
 cos elite eat restaurant always clean .
 once a while they want to adventure and eat ckt .
 then surprise pikachu ,  the hawker center v dirty .
 comment this la comment tt la .
 say low ses people no upbringing la .
 treat cleaners like maid la .
 as if elite no maid at home   .
 this is same like rich people look down on poor people when they talk privately .
 bt twist until like social etiquette prob so can say in public domain .
 people dont realize .
 chiu all poor fks kena used and pwned by elite .
 worse is poor people think they got class and upbringing by siding with the elites .
 is chiu all kena used ,  people telling chiu hw to live .
 damn disgusting woman !
 played her part in this screw up law being in place in singapore and now cracking up such garbage as saying its excessive ?
 very good advice ,  test your appeal to other companies and chiu will see the demand for your experience
 can teach me how to play politics ah ?
 i seriously feel like i am super bad at it
 always test your market value by refreshing and sending out your cv .
 then u how much u are worth .
 actually ,  look at the quality of the role ,  is it something remarkable or is it so generic that there &apos;s nothing special worth mentioning ?
 im just afraid that people may change position from one with good prospects to one with poorer prospects just cos the new change looks appealing on the surface
 im somewhere in the middle ,  not much career progression bit at least salary not bad + boss still continues to engage me for some projects along the way (increases learning exp) .
 difficult cos now they all know my style and pattern liao .
 if i suddenly change ,  will be very fishy
 ask what u want 1st ?
 if co near yr hse ,  n when u are new parent .
 just hang n play ard .
 if the pay is high n project finish is lobo ,  just clock pay .
 proby yr boss scare u ,  class u as technical specialist .
 keep u for hands n legs .
 no more management path .
 when u are good to move ,  take yr experience n expertise elsewhere .
 job is mutual benefit ,  when no longer benefit or suits u ,  go .
 no prospects ,  better to look for another job .
 yea last time i was young .
 now i realise liao 
 thats what i told myself last year .
 give myself a year and see if there is any improvement .
 last yr ard this time went to ask my boss again if there is any plan to promote me .
 again he said ,  wait la .
 why chiu so impatient ?
 mine oso similar case as well .
 not much progression .
 increment is at the same slow rate since past few years .
 lots of projects which boss will keep saying i should do cos good for my portfolio .
 depends on individual .
 if u think u not happy .
 better find a new job 1st then zao
 when u get to promote it might not be as what u envisioned .
  i got promoted after 4yrs working to manage a team of 2 .
 my first forray as a people manager .
 5yrs passed im still not quite used .
 felt more satisfaction as an individual contributor afterall
 for limpeh is no choice ,  no promotion oso nevermind ,  cos will be weeded out by discriminatory hiring .
 practise or the outside poly-graded salary will not be attractive to limpeh .
 question in order .
 1) is it a sme ?
  - if yes ,  always be on the move to mnc ,  glcs and civil service .
 after chiu complete question 1 .
  move to mnc and glc and cs .
 then is quesiton 2) does your boss like chiu .
  if not ,  always be on the move .
 it is what chiu oredi know .
 chiu are the sai kang warrior in your unit .
 your boss and your management should know that so they are reluctant to promote chiu since they dont want chiu to let go of the existing projects .
 or they dont see chiu wanting to leave the place .
 in a company 2 things u must take note .
 is your boss a good boss ?
 is your majority colleagues are good people ?
 if one of the above the answer is  &apos;no &apos; then that is a taxic compan ter look for another company .
 boss: if u have an asshole boss even after afew years u work so hard to prove your worth he still pretend not to see ,  u will get nowhere no promotion and worst when u tender your signation letter to him he will try to give u promotion and hope u stay if u stay that  &apos;promotion &apos; will be your 1st and your last !
 u will waste your time in that company and u will regret staying .
 colleagues: if u got backstabing colleagues that is the worst they will make your life like hell everyday u have to look at your back and u will feel  alone in that company .
 and not matter how well u work if these horrible people sabo u u oso cannot get anywhere .
 if i change to another place ,  my skill set will be there but have to climb the ladder from scratch .
 like need to prove my worth all over again .
 maybe it doesnt matter so much cos i am not really that high up the ladder at my current place anyway .
 can find another co which is around the same area oso .
 this year ,  i have a team i am in charge of .
 in fact ,  yes ,  they gave me more headache but boss said this is a necessary experience if i want to climb .
 no choice but have to grit my teeth and go through it .
 chey i thought it is related to warhammer lore under bretonnia .
 anyone knows the equivalent thread of hwz for ladies ?
 which can chat and bitch abt men etc ?
 fluentpork or something like dat .
 another m cross dresser .
 haha knew it .
 this forum design will not endear to female users
 tiagong lots of bitches bitching about men there  
 got poloboiboi post handsum men here also
 nothing to do with it la .
 just wana find a forum to chit chat with like minded ladies .
 so jelly that chiu guys have edmw
 flower pork lor
 yeah not our fault that flowerpork ,  the oni biggish female-oriented forum in singapore other than petalbytes was hacked by albanian hackers several yrs ago and has been defunct ever since .
 they leave wholesome comments praising each other but behind the scenes still gossiping
 u are many yrs too late .
 blowing wind lol
 got such acc meh ?
 oh someone came back
 why the ladies like to do this kind of thing  ah ?
 in front of each other praise each other like best buddies for life .
 once the turn their backs then will talk trash and sh !
 t about the other .
 i oso want to know 
 in the mood to be back .
 shocked to see the new layout and cant use the app anymore
 how come their death so high ?
 even more that the daily infected .
 this probably means their infection rate is alot higher than reported .
 so much talent but no toilet ?
 not so free to give everybody coding test .
 sinkies are not good scammers .
 too honest and trust too easily .
 wat &apos;s wrong with making more money ?
 u know the biggest land lord here ?
 rising hdb prices are a way to fund the retirement of the earlier generations who dont have much savings .
 millenials should learn to be thrifty ,  go for 3 dollar cai peng ,  avoid going korea or japan holiday every year; go pulau ubin can alrdy
 i think now got a new species of snakes called black mumbai .
 if sinkies r daft and attend a subpar education system here ,  dey r still daft
 are chiu saying the faang companies give every single person who submit a job application a coding test ?
 wake up ,  delusional fool .
 jin sarki mens .
 chiu said ceca are most talentless .
 but why udemy and other training portal quite a number of it content creator are ceca leh .
 i have not even come across 1  from singapore .
 from coding test talk until buttock cleaners   chiu just proven how stupid cecas are .
 anybody oso can teach ,  how many of them actually got quality ?
 so we are attracting top name mncs whose jobs locals cannot fill ?
 how to scam la if not complex ?
 look on the bright side ,  if motherland appreciates the little province of singapore maybe they will send us more cattle and livestock for the future .
 we can groom the sinkie natives to become farmers to provide for the higher castes people back in the capital
 the prajit guy from nium is fking facepalm .
 big red flag for that company’s investors or employees .
 “react native ,  js which are android based” ,  “java is backend” .
 he doesn’t seem to know what he’s talking about .
 hard to say if singapore will have another 50 years that is as glorious as the first 50 years .
 heng moi use java to code kotlin to program android to compile .
 i think what u mean is cheena is advanced on stolen tech .
 their indigenous tech is not high level like germany ,  japan ,  usa or even south korea .
 lots of reverse engineering to “steal aka integrate the foreign tech and call it chinese tech .
 they are simply a manufacturing hub die to labour not a tech hub .
 bedok or paya lebar area ?
 chiu come 10kukujiao sure many open 1
 in before fast food
 i think james like benedict is pinocchio .
 just in time for a fine review .
 diana ser becoming more and more chio as she ages .
 i used to think she was just above average last time .
 now become very milfy .
 rather than fine the culprit should be made to clean tables at hawker centre for a week that is more effective than a fine .
 just like litterbugs are punished by having to serve corrective work order picking up rubbish in public areas
 tray return is more deadly than speeding
 the return tray law is screwed up to begin with !
 cos the hawkers are oredi paying for cleaners to do it !
 why should sinkies do it cos f up people like egg slug amy dunno how to implement things properly ?
 our traffic law are very lenient .
 just like chiu are fined for killing someone with a vehicle .
 but chiu get jail or the death sentence when killing someone with anything without wheels
 even kill people in car accident oni disqualify u from driving from a certain amount of time nia .
 i think chiu need to go for a brain check up .
 administration in singapore is going down the drain ,  despite many more highly paid civil servants  .
 ds is high iq to ask such question .
 the amy khor is really a phd ,  permanent head damage .
 i want her to offend my tongue by releasing laosai into my mouth
 i think we better make it a habit not to eat out unless it us necessary .
 chiu eat own sai ?
 hope lta increase to match and shut her up .
 human life is nothing as compared to returning tray
 who did she voted for ?
 this is what sinkies wanted isn’t it ?
 some plc really not worth to work in .
 we never know when we may work together again .
 so far never encountered .
 oso dont do to my lousy staff that resigned .
 cos he dont even want to see me .
 my boss everyday rude to me .
 the last day of my  &apos;day &apos; in all the companies i ever worked for would normally end up in some ktv room or siam diu .
 what if one day u ended up becoming his boss  .
 my boss was nowhere to be seen on my last day
 oni **** my rsm on my ord day .
 point middle finger at each other .
 not happy go back alley  and meet my gangsters from malaysia .

 how far can society go before another world war .
 what made hitler snap ?
 @chilax18 i suggest that chiu visit imh for an evaluation soon .
 your comments are worrying
 he shouldn &apos;t end up in jail if they were all of age and willing parties .
 it &apos;s a free world .
 many young girls are stupid and naive and easy to get into bed since they have more testosterone thats why older men like them better .
 i am happy alone .
 i am oso not alone .
 actually this de beers got hidden talent for scamming .
 can be temasek subcon for negotiations with the damn cecas though will be tough for him meeting those king of kings…
 then u can expect the future males to be as subservient as u think
 de beers not gonna have any beer for quite some time .
 this is the debeers guy ?
 dont tell me it &apos;s a free world all that nonsense .
 one alone being laxxed with rules does not mean all the rest of the world reolvolves around u
 it &apos;s this issue .
 being able to be scammed by him just proves that money makes the world go round .
 but im telling chiu that once chiu get all those kitties easily when you &apos;re rich it &apos;s going to bore chiu most of the time unless you &apos;re in horndog mode .
 if there &apos;s no challenge ,  there &apos;s no kick to it .
 stupid and naive women but anyway they should just move on with life .
 i wouldnt call it families destroyed .
 they just have to learn from it and understand that the adult world isnt as simple as they think it is .
 he forgot to switch account
 may all guys be as foolish as u wish .
 it is a free world full of nonsense .
 repeat after me .
 life is never fair .
 it is never fair and will never be fair .
 what about victims of missing planes ?
 not even a single true closure .
 just live your life with what chiu have now and enjoy what chiu can make out of it instead of contemplating about the trash people get in life .
 there &apos;s no use thinking about that and it &apos;s a time waster .
 can u imagine if he didnt appealed ?
 thats oni about 3 years after minus good conduct and holidays .
 i have to say 3 years is quite worth it ,  the 11 girls are aged 18-24 young and pretty .
 some people live 100years but is in vain cos never enjoy anything lol .
 too bad he hand itchy go appeal the deal become not as good .
 anyway these girls are probably seasoned tons of dicks said hello to their pussies oredi .
 damages are minimum .
 dont shoot me ah just my 2c hah
 it was a transaction ,  they were willing parties to be introduced to sugar daddies ,  he had no intention to fulfill the duties on his part .
 so its a scam ,  almost rape if chiu call it .
 however ,  things would &apos;ve been different if he dangles himself as the sugar daddy ,  give out some cash etc .
 what a dumb ass this guy is .
 why didn’t the court prosecute the 11 women ?
 they are selling sex too .
 it’s not like they are victim oni .
 would chiu sue your potential employer after your interview didn’t go through ?
 just out of curiosity…how do chiu ‘trick’ a woman into having sex with chiu ?
 it’s consensual or rape … .
 an unwilling woman who totally refuses sex with chiu … .
 how he gonna do it ?
 as long as consent given  and reciprocal ,  cannot say its trick what  .
 easy explain cny rate n urgency charge  .
 want people come during cny period n do it urgent of course need to pay more
 hawker cny up price 50 cent oredi kena scold until no father no mother .
 this one is jitao 5x the amount .
 if a hwaker sell chicken rice during cny for $15 a plate .
 shop think kena throw egg liao .
 but seriously ah hawker up $0 .
 50 kena scold meh .
 my side up $2 or smth then the workers all get double pay leh  .
 sounds familiar to our hdb and healthcare prices .
 yupp they claim that their water heaters can last up to 25yrs
 your example is not fitting of the situation  .
 it’s like u buy 300k sell her 3 million  .
 this one hdb might not even approve and u might be suspected of money laundering leh
 decided to wavier off his cny surcharge and absorb losses ,  if any ,  in view of the (negative) public interest .
 he follow hospital pricing
 if a product can last so long ,  the company wont last long cos no repeat customers .
 might as well charge a million dollars for cny surcharge .
 excuse to fleece .
 in a low life scammers universe .
 haha all the retards defending him diam diam liao
 there is no 300 tale of silver here .
 so where is case in this saga ?
 if need social media to get justice ,  then i suggest get rid of the jlb toothless tiger case .
 need those with drop down long pole to hang my blanket and bedsheets one .
 any good brand with installation to recomand ?
 $300 possible or not ?
 pay enough she &apos;ll drop down on your long pole while hanging on to your blanket and bedsheets .
 just get from taobao those good quality stainless steel rack .
 get higher ones if chiu are tall enough .
 lasting ,  easy to use and can just shift around very convenient .
 chiu from top hang down oso look ugly .
 how does it look like ?
 no idea which type of racks u referring to .
 do u mean protable racks with no install required ?
 see how much pay
 ts current pay scale how much ?
 got 7k or above boh ?
 thank chiu for the advice .
 boss i feel is the not-very-committed to my progress kind .
 as long as i can get the work done ,  thats it .
 colleagues dont like my boss .
 every day can hear them complaining about him .
 they have their own cliques but i dont think they trust me enough to let me in .
 that company is toxic no point wasting your time in that company i believe u oredi know the answer .
 dont be like me i wasted 10 years in a toxic company and i regreted it and hate myself in the end .
 if oni someone gave me a good advice late time .
 now job market is not good must endure once no more covid and job market better look for another job and start afresh and if the next job u feel the same look for another job until u can find what u looking for and never never leave a job without securing another job !
 got any offer higher than this ?
 chiu should go interview first see whether your salary is above or below market rate
 yea ,  i feel like i have wasted nearly 6 yrs then like not much progression plus so much sai kang to tank every day .
 meanwhile those higher ranked than me every day disappear for long lunches and tea time .
 they dont do work cannot blame them; if i dont do mine sure will kena whack
 i researched le .
 plus minus $500 ard there .
 but honestly i always think the salary is not the biggest issue .
 it is the lack of appreciation and recognition .
 normally these higher rank they are very lazy they love to give u their work load and that is why they have more time to east snake .
 this is very horrible .
 sometime they will say  &apos;can u help do this work &apos; end up it is part of your work load .
 i kena so many time oredi in singapore
 u know my last day of work (in finance company ) in singapore my ceo (angmo) secrectly plan a surprise farewell party for me !
 even gave a speech saying in his 30 years being a ceo he never see such a hardworking and very motivated staff and then he called my name and told me to give a speech infront the whole office !
 i was so surprise almost cried but i endure and gave a simple speech lol .
 my ceo told me to enjoy the party and food and before i go home he want to see me and i did we chat and ask me if i got another job waiting for me i told him i migrating to asutralia and he gave me his personal phone number and told me to use him as referee when i go for job interview !
 see this is the best appreciation !
 but before that did he treat chiu and give chiu your due appreciation ?
 or wait till last day then say ?
 i look around my frens from uni fb profile all director leber liao .
 jin depressing   .
 directors but dunno celery got director leber oso or not ?
 yes bro my female manager gave me very good increament .
 infact working in that finance company was the happiest working experince i had in singapore 
 sigh lucky chiu .
 i dunno how many workplaces i must go to before i can find a good one  .
 must see whether the company is big or small .
 chiu can always set up an one man company n become the director immediately 
 dont give up and keep on finding if u stop finding then it is zero % .
 but if u keep on looking the percentage to get a good working enviroment is higher .
 jmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  yeah peace
 it &apos;s never worth to be corporate slave .
 lowest quote or not i dunno .
 after project completed ,  still need to spend years to resolve the massive number of bugs 1 by 1 .
 never ending headache .
 somemore we have to cover half the cost of resolving all these when the ceca coy delivered inferior product
 i wonder who chiu voted for too  
 little wonder why they hire their own .
 how many of them oredi spread the delta variant here .
 can ask all of them to wfh in india and dont come here ?
 dont have the people with the skill set or not at the price range ?
 some of those jobs in private industry pay so horribly that most people either move out of it or go into management roles .
 moe trainees need to include 1 lakh rupee self paid india stint to learn the way-of-the-talent .
 so good in complex mega projects but indiasuperpower2020 .
 hdb is not true pubic housing becuase one is allowed to buy and sell and profit from it .
 but no one would like it to be a truly public housing model cos of those who have profiteered from it  and those who will be angry that they wont be allowed to profit from it .
 simply put  - another screw up
 hope sinkieland can replace our own ministers with them .
 cheaper faster better
 tell me what is the degree of mark zuckerberg ?
 what is the degree of bill gates ?
 do all harvard ,  mit grads end up being richest people on earth ?
 we focus alot on degrees ,  but companies want people with right skill set ,  experience and attitude .
 degrees don’t matter after few years of being in job .
 u ask snakes what they think u lack ?
 of course they say u lack meat and blood to keep them full la
 singapore has a track record of not farking up big projects on a regular basis unlike motherland
 cos sinkies scared of losing jobs .
 ceca can just jump to another tech coy .
 or better still .
 buy study a mba from spu
 racist indians think we dunno what they are up to
 ministry of trade cannot work with education to develop the right talent .
 how many years already… .
 many sinkies are learning from these cecas .
 they create jobs for sinkies and improve our lives .
 there are good and bad ones but my guess is at least 50% of those in spore are not up to standard .
 just that they can talk birds down the trees .
 i have encountered this type before they can promise anything under the sun then if they cant do it push it to others to do .
 totally agree with apar .
 time for us to wake up and improve .
 dbs need to hire more tech people from india to fix their complex tech projects
 simply company is in wrong locatio/country
 just look at the faces ,  all indians .
 of cos indians helping fellow indians ,  sinkies can never compete against .
 their favortisim practice and discriminatory hiring practice de .
 a developed country having talents from all .
 over the world can have severe shortage of talents ,  compared to a 3rd world and superstitious nation like .
 their covid outbreak even catching up with the us ,  due to their slum-like living condition .
 what more can i say ?
 thats life in singapore under the pap ,  just be grabs sua .
 uncle sen never jiak prosperity burger ah
 very messy for ig .
 huai must post ig ?
 the chicken patty is it same same as mcchicken one ?

 cozycot and flowerpod both ko liao .
 maybe chiu can ask hwz to start one for females
 i’m a lady and i don’t really bitch about guys .

 first thing i thought of when i saw ts thread .
 simi lanjiaos - my office got the faraday cage block all my telegrams
 value$ store made me realised how overcharged other shops are .
 value$ store made me realised how overcharged other shops are
 form million dollar white elephants to feed .
 now then u know
 now then chiu know .
 too bad chiu oso don’t realise how overpaid our politicians are 
 i buy the toothpaste $1  .
 toilet cleaner $1 .
 just bought mcvities dark chocolate 1kg 4 bucks .
 now then u know
 i u turn back to buy
 i see it too but others would chime in and say cheap stuff got rat poison insai *rolls eyes*
 but quality can trust or not ?
 ntuc opened by gahment chiu know 
 about time bro !
 one just have to street smart .
 its about the source of the product not the merchant .
 paying premium for any item oso can be screwed .
 always check ,  regardless of where u buy from: .
 manufactured in countries .
 colour & taste (senses tells u if off ,  throw)
 all those value dollar stores are for low ses people to patronize .
 high ses people will go to those highly priced stores to buy their atas goods .
 since a kid we &apos;ve grown w/ them  .
 nt a single hint of clue tht we &apos;ve been overcharged
 last time value shop everything is 1 dollar one .
 ever since pinoy took over and staff mostly pinoy ,  the price seem to be increasing .
 did chiu check where those stuff are manufactured  ?
 if use this as benchmark our most expensive city ranking can drop by alot right ?
 abc shop is one of the best stores i love to visit every week cos every week will have some interesting cheap items .
 last time my magnum chocolate $1 ,  now $2 .
 chiu wear $400 slippers go eat this low ses meal ah ,  ts ?
 wah makings of a rich man
 that generous amount of pork lard .
 by the way ,  i dont see any mee .
 then i see something like onsen egg ?
 what exactly is this bowl ar ?
 arent those fish balls .
 fish ball  noodlekway teow .
 noodle hidden below
 some are even on garden leave for 6 months  .
 my boss and colleagues treat moi to a farewell lunch in a restaurant .
 can just zao anytime chiu want ,  no need to wait until 6pm .
 one manager even became his ex-worker &apos;s subordinate 2 levels down in another company 8 yrs down .
 cos of their good relationship ,  the manager get good opportunities recommendations .
 true life story .
 wish i have such life .
 i got one late manager gave me 3 farewell lunches .
 then later become frd .
 lol my other colleagues gave me a nice farewell lunch and a gift but my boss just avoided me during the entire 1 month notice period .
 yes ,  had to organise my own farewell meal and invited everyone from the office .
 invited my boss too but he decline 
 that’s why 1 month notice must always have black and white
 my ex boss said wanna throw farewell lunch/dinner .
 me happy happy wait until i left the office quietly .
 mine started monitoring my work closely when she did not in the past .
 i told her off and said in case she thinks i will play punk ,  i will not cos my reputation is very important to me .
 i dont want to leave with a bad reputation .
 she backed off .
 in another company ,  there is a certain cut off date to hand in your letter .
 if chiu missed this date ,  chiu have to serve 20 weeks notice .
 this is for a part time teaching position .
 moi sho far hokz la .
 just gotch huan tried to persuade moi to stay .
 moi guess is just cos it &apos;s troublesome to find replacement .
 ex boss still gave me a gift .
 oni kena rude/sarcastic remark from one ex colleague .
 during meeting ,  say what abandon ship ,  leave home bullsh1t .
 vp unmarried lao zhabor still talk from backside .
 i will still support the previous company .
 one i was head hunted .
 i still support my previous when my colleague called .
 too much to handover .
 i support via phone for at least 3 months .
 he rude then chiu just smile more smugly to trigger him further
 just be professional .
 but when chiu boss calls chiu one day just ignore or act blur
 i left quietly after doing my clearance .
 then people started to looking for me to do stuff .
 exited the whatsapp groups the moment i exited the gate .
 i supported my former colleague for more than 6 months .
 poor colleague was left alone to deal with all the load with no formal handover .
 my manager wasn &apos;t around for some time when i tendered .
 i got fed up waiting so i just tender straight to my management .
 suddenly all the machines started working .
 serving notice period is the most songz period .
 chiu are the king liao in oppit .
 the latest news is pub went to inspect the installation and found alot of issues    .
 paid 850 to anyhow install .
 economists in charge of health ,  transport ,  education ,  infocom .
 doctors in charge of defence ,  manpower ,  and foreign affairs .
 accountants in charge of ministry of environment .
 ex-generals in charge of smrt ,  childcare ,  trade union .
 what do chiu expect when the ones at the very top are unqualified people with no relevant experience ?
 if got underlying medical reason ,  kill 3 oni fine
  alot laws nowadays sibei no logic .
 i wondered why elites are elites haiz
 cos speeding never cause harm to anyone mah ,  if hit someone or some property then is another offence which is more serious then non return tray
 elites dont think that way la .
 time for speeding to increase fine
 do chiu **** your own ass ?
 thats comparing apples to oranges .
 speeding is in a process of getting from point a to b and harder to catch ,  unless via speed camera or speed gun and by authorities or informants .
 and never return tray or utensils is after chiu makan ,  u leave the table means chiu never clear the table and from far can spot and summon chiu .
 prob never return tray is akin to never park legally .
 singapore is a fine city .
 sinkies all low ses ,  need laws to obey rules .
 tourists all will automatic clear trays after makan .
 which skool did xxx went to ,  .
 muz have been a xxx skool .
 civil service mindset is as long as chiu are a scholar ,  they can parachute chiu around different portfolios and think that there will be efficiency and effectiveness .
 while at the same time ,  they tell people working in private sector that we dont have talent with relevant skills and thats why we need ceca/foreigners .
 dont give them idea later they ban people from hawker center
 smacking a $300 fine for not returning tray is an overkill  .
 the fine should be same as not displaying parking coupon $40
 cos of this slut that promote tray return .
 now fine is high wants to use this to bitch again ?
 chio bu is always right
 luckily she not minister or else sure many funny law .
 cos it &apos;s a pet project of some willful and ignorant brat who cant accept failure and  &apos;no &apos; for answers .
 speeding can kill another sinkie live .
 tray return can kill another sinkie livelihood .
 with remission he’ll be out in 5 years
 lol ,  he could &apos;ve been out in 3 years ,  had he not appealed against his sentence .
 the victims r not angels oso ,  they r going to sell their bodies anyway .
 de beers just wana ownself makan n never intro them big fishes .
 e victims dulan n report him
 yah i oso dunno how can say he tricked them .
 so what would be example of not tricking them ?
 probably cosz he extort more sex after the first encounter (by blackmailing using the photos) .
 if he stopped after the test drive .
 maybe he wouldnt tiok ?
 u missed your imh appt again ?
 in the end its really true that the cheapest woman is the one u pay money for .
 ya its stupid that he appealed .
 most probably his lawyer told him not to
 the society is as such .
 cases do not stop .
 it &apos;s never ending .
 dont expect such cases to stop
 but to those who wish to own your spouse ,  it is not right .
 so is this case actually seeks to protect more sinkie women who want a career as social escorts ?
 now mothers can confidently groom their daughters for this lucrative career choice of the future .
 it &apos;s about what the world became .
 and how we can correct it .
 slowly but surely .
 is the judge discouraging social escorts or those waylaying social escorts ?
 back when i posted saf flies helicopter ,  now that such threads ought to be deleted ,  the mods dont do their work .
 every such thread is sensitive and disturbing .
 we never know who ever visits such threads and who ever feel offended about the openness of discussion .
 so the moral of story is we need a more close knitted environment where one cares for the other .
 but how to do it .
 i love to be alone .
 so i dunno .
 ts left less than 200 posts to promote to supremacy members ,  so he spam pcw lor
 chiu want to avoid sensitive topics ,  please head over to reddit r/singapore instead .
 there they will delete anything deemed remotely offensive
 to prevent such things from happening to our social escort daughters and sisters ,  we should remove the middlemen ,  and introduce an app like property guru .
 called syt guru .
 is like asking why must post in edmw .
 she ask is it the gahment give free shopping coupon to their people for shopping .

 almost every single meeting is about this topic

 oni the lady boss is the ok one .

 i doubt his business is doing well ,  his current place the rent is much cheaper
 some male bosses also
 best way is to come back and visit your old colleagues with a new fancy title and higher pay a few weeks after chiu leave the company .
 make sure chiu bump into your boss during your visit .
 very shiok one .
 thats how tripods survive  .
 your last day leh not your boss .
 chiu can throw the report far far away and walk out like a boss ,  he oso cant do anything to chiu .
 if that guy insist on not doing the handover ,  dont think they can do anything about it .
 not enough to withhold his release or salary unless he &apos;s suspected of stealing .
 eyes become dry then tired ?
 kopi is dehydrating la .

 why amy don squid game and allow tray ambassador to give one shot to head ?

 what &apos;s the reply ?
 v gd question .
 she’s like pap full time dog liao .
 act bad cop but oso the one initiate the media of return tray .
 i support diana ser .
 cos she is chio .
 tray returning and cleaning ones owness should have been inculcated and mandated 30years back .
 when i was in korea for 2 years ,  i was amassed of their culture .
 they need to return their trays in mcd .
 rubbish need to be sorted out .
 and put in bags each costing some one dollar .
 recyclables like plastic bottles can be disposed in bags at no cost .
 non recyclables will be simply dumped back by refuse collector if not properly disposed and the household will be fined .
 korea overall was much cleaner and organized than singapore .
 yes there was spitting by the  workers (due to the low temperature ?
 overall much better than singapore
 pap always screw up their priorities .
  things that they should do ,  they wont bother .
 but those boliao stuff ,  ah ,  they like to micromanage it .
 it is like company isnt doing well ,  all the senior directors didnt bother to discuss serious issues but focus on toilet cleanliness matter
 her hubby is a banker .
 she runs a media and consulting company .
 u got to wonder when was the last time she dined in at a hawker for her to be such a strong advocate of the tray return ruling .
 cos the last i checked ,  tray return dont applies to elites dining at a restaurant
 got to train people mah .
 so all will guai guai return .
 police not so harsh as nea as crime(accident) is not as bad as not returning trays .
 speeding should be higher fines ,  $150 pump petrol one time gone oredi - no feeling to drivers out there - need to be $1500 and for those with conti cars need to be $15 , 000 then have feeling .
 haha so up the fine for speeding to $15 , 000 .
 since speeding kills and tray return or not does not harm a life .
 speeding oni money meh ?
 it &apos;s the demerit points that kills the driver .
 this is how business owners cut cost and buy more condos
 oni pappies understand  .
 chiu all dont talk so much .
 later she dulan keep the fine for tray return at $300 and drastically increases all other offences .
 then chiu all know who is the queen
 cos all ministar drive ,  kym ?
 its true ,  should fine gao gao like $1000 ,  else people will heck care continue to speed and cause more disasters

 able to go lunch and tcss with lots of milf(30+)…and their figure still quite ok… .
 we are not all entreprenuers right
 it did cross my mind to open up my own business but had to shelve my plan these few years cos the economy is so unstable 
 this one quite rare .
 in fact ,  most superiors will want chiu to regret leaving the company and they lack of someone for them to take advantage of .
 im trying to setup my own company now .
 the first 3 projects i quoted for oredi worth 650k .
 no need to slave in company for miserable 100k .
 but difficult to sustain this in the long run .
 unless chiu are good at marketing and have good word-of-mouth by your first few clients
 cheap and good and value for money .
 the oni real thing is your salary .
 the appreciation and recognition will oni make chiu shiok for a while oni .
 once chiu made a mistake ,  they will oni remember u for your error .
 ts how old are chiu .
 if chiu are young then good to work in a few company .
 but like the others say ,  the oni real thing is salary .
 go to new place ,  but of course with a higher pay .
 while salary is  indeed the more practical indicator ,  boss giving u extra work dont necessarily mean bad esp if is new portfolio n u learn new stuff n get exp anyway .
 hope one day chiu can be like me ,  retired young with multiple properties 
 my client is a developer and a builder company .
 we are partnership to do all their projects .
 not to mention colleagues always like to add sauce add spice once u make and error then baotoh u to the boss  the younger and newer ones in my place behave like this .
 i keep trying to remember if i was like this in the past but i dont think so .
 now it &apos;s really a dog-eat-dog world .
 the best working environment where people respect eachother and i feel like a human being again .
 that 4 years of working in this company was the happiest sweet memories i had in singapore !
 very typical in local smes .
 but do 1 wrong ,  .
 they will forgot the 99 others .
 yea thats what my boss said .
 always said good for your portfolio .
 but i dont see how useful the portfolio is since it is not going to help me move up or anything .
 why did chiu leave then ?
 nice to see that ,  so how long did it take u to find this company to work in ?
 if your boss don’t have intention to promote u and your colleagues are toxic ,  u must leave and find another job  .
 u oredi gave urself 1 yr to evaluate and it the result is clear ,  don’t hesitate anymore .
 what does your gut feeling say ?
 logic and facts oredi prove u should move .
 migration to australia .
 liddat i oso everytime tio  &apos;scam &apos; ley .

 no scamming action is commendable

 he got what he asked for 
 which one has the highest psle result ah ?
 “small space” teo had the lowest
 might as well ask which one is closest to the imperial family by blood .
 how about those didnt even took psle here ?
 why should fines for not returning trays be higher than speeding ?
 this is a very symptom of a sickness plaguing the nation .
 laws and bills being set up without public approval and support .
 as such the legal system feels very myopic .
 if sinkies are going to fix this problem ,  politicians (parasites) have to be eradicated from the system itself .
 if no screw cap ,  still can drink ?
 or will it just slowly evaporate till no more ?
 u are asking what to do without the cap ?
 still can drink .
 just use a cork to cover or something else .
 or u can just finish the bottle
 finish the bott lor
 pour the liquor into water bottle .
 use parafilm to seal
 use a cork to cover
 use it to cook steaks
 if i leave the bottle open ,  can still drink the alcohol ?
 ya ,  and house no have replacement cork or cap oso ,  then how ?
 chiu got spare caps from those yeos drinks ?
 of size can fit just cover .
 if size doesnt fit use scorch tape and tape the gap .
 as long as dust doesnt drop inside .
 ever put bottle at pubs when u cant finish ?
 ya u can keep opened bottles .
 but make suree to cover it so it doesnt evaporate .
 quite nice and catchy

 i left the big insurance company without a job cos had enough of it .
 it took me many months to find a job i sent resumes to many companies all never get back to me i really lose hope .
 then i went to job agency and they look for a job for me .
 after afew month later i went to lasik at national eye centre had day time operation and after the operation i took a cab home then the agency called me saying there a job interview in the afternoon and i told them i will go for the interview and before i enter thr building it took off the eye patch my a bit watery and went for interview lol .
 that was how desperate i was to get a job to put food on the table .
 fortunately i got the job !
 3 points to know if the current working environment worth it: .
 1) is the pay enough to let u live without worries/stress abt bills ,  stressful abt financial woes .
 2) did chiu get enough good relationship with colleagues .
 3) sufficient recognition from your bosses as of now .
 if the above answer of the 3 is yes ,  mean is good enough .
 if got one part u answer no ,  try to look into that ,  and oso maybe it is time to change
 salary is not everything .
 sometimes salary too high ,  the stress might overwhelming .
 so keyword is  &apos;good enough &apos; ,  dont ask for too much
 get the exp n move up in another coy .
 your immediate supervisor is youe best mirror .
 good to know that your story has a happy ending and you &apos;re now having a good life in aus .
 thank chiu for letting me know all hope is not lost !
 if i move ,  the next workplace will be my third one .
 my first company not too bad but i left oso cos felt stagnant after a while and this current one was able to offer me a higher pay at that time .
 with my current lifestyle n side income through investment ,  no complain .
 2) friendly enough to be able to go lunch ,  celebrate bdays etc but they are nt the kind who will help me move up .
 each for himself kind .
 3) biggest issue as of now cos boss seems ai mai ai mai in helping me to progress .
 sadly in singapore the oni surely way to get better prospects is to jump to another company .
 don’t bother what people might say job hopping the real reason why people job hopping cos in singapore majority of bosses are asshole they try their best not to promote u they scare one day u will over take them !
 so the oni way to have good future is to go for another company unless u got a good boss who see u up then that is a different story can stay in that company afew years more .
 and when u jump to another company u oso bring along all your previous work experiences and they should pay u more that is the beauty .
 the most important don’t give up bro .
 i know u will succeed !
 hope no further variants of concerns and everything recovers by 2023 .
 how old are chiu ?
 just keep looking out for better stuff .
 why dont chiu just for another company the same position chiu want ?
 cos these few years economy is a bit unstable .
 plus go new place need to adapt to new environment n prove myself all over again .
 these are the pull factors .
 but i guess the push factors are eclipsing the pull so likely will polish my resume n escape soon haha
 ok i know what chiu mean .
 im in a similar position and pay freeze somemore
 do chiu have plans to leave as well ?
 or continue to stay ?
 retire young for what ?
 money is always not enough .
 i oredi have 3 houses ,  but what &apos;s wrong with 6 ,  9 or more houses ?
 entrepreneurship is not easy ,  i have to do competitive quotations ,  meet deadlines ,  hiring the right staffs and making sure the profit and loss are balance .
 i just finished working on my business plan ,  pricing chart ,  estimations ,  scheduling of works ,  monthly forecasting ,  marketing and planning future works .
 what are some traits of  &apos;good boss &apos; ?
 there’s no such thing as a  .
 you’re paid to carry out a  .
 function for a specified fee .
 you’re not paid to receive the grace of .
 a charitable old man .
 plan to leave oredi ,  i concluded i dont want to waste more time in current coy
 from what i see ,  your 1)2) no much issue ,   oni 3) got some issue ,  your problem is not big enough for chiu to change job yet .
 seem like chiu oredi got what have in one career ,  the issue now is chiu feel your progress is not  &apos;fast enough &apos; ,  and  &apos;not sure whether your boss will help to move up &apos; .
 my suggestion: have  a chat with your boss ,  see what plan he have for u specific ,  let say he tell u ,   &apos;sorry bluzzy ,  no promotion for u next xx year ,  but in return we can give u some extra allowance per month if chiu willing to stay ?
  &apos; something liddat ,  give and take ,  most likely if have a chat with him ,  see what he say ,  and if chiu are willing to accept .
 see if chiu willing to wait for xx years they offer .
 of cos chiu oso must be mentally prepared they are oni stalling time ,  after xx years they might find another excuse and ask u fly kite ,  all those are gambles we have to take in life .
 when chiu get the outcome ,  chiu oso must measure ,  does it worth the effort and risk to change job .
 let say chiu change to good company with good salary + good supervisor that willing to groom chiu ,  but oso just nice that company everyone is very zai and sakis ,  until chiu oso cannot promote ,  then how ?
 chiu must know what are chiu willing sacrifice
 i beg to differ ,  good boss is something bonus ,  but my boss is really good ,  but he oso cannot help me much in promotion ,  cos got other factor .
 there is still good boss and nice boss in the world .
 wait till grandpa hears eurobeat
 the son want collect insurance money isit ?
 heng crashing in game wont cost his life
 if it was a porsche 911 non cabriolet ,  i think will even be faster
 ok later i go buy

 this is a true story .
 (if i say it &apos;s a true story ,  i confirm with chiu it &apos;s a true story .
 no need to doubt) .
 this happened roughly 3 years ago .
 i attended a kind of a course ,  for job purposes .
 over there ,  mostly there were more women than men .
 i can say i didnt have much competition .
 there was this woman ,  aged around early 30s ,  named amy .
 we talked a few times during breaks ,  nothing special .
 then one time ,  during one particular break ,  near the water cooler ,  we chatted ,  and she asked for my numbers .
 i didnt think much of it ,  i just told her my numbers loh .
 after that ,  over the course of several days and weeks ,  she messaged me a few times .
 just like ,  hi how are chiu ,  what are chiu doing ,  etc .
 then one day she asked me ,  do chiu like to go out and watch a movie together with me  ?
 actually i didnt think a movie is a good activity for a first date ,  cos we wouldnt be able to talk much during the movie .
 but nvm la ,  i just said yes loh .
 we met at a mall ,  then we walk walk around a bit ,  then we went to the cinema .
 i sensed something was a bit not right ,  like we didnt have much chemistry .
 after that ,  several days later ,  .
 one of our mutual friends ,  a woman ,  told me this amy told her i was horrible .
 i stank ,  i stood too close ,  and i tried to hold her hands which made her feel uncomfortable .
 i felt buaysong .
 if it &apos;s true i was a creep ,  at least keep it private la .
 no need to spread it around and ruin my reputation among our mutual friends mah .
 i messaged her and i told her off .
 i said she was being unladylike for spreading rumours about me and our dating experience .
 it was unnecessary .
 after that we both blocked each other .
 it &apos;s been 3 years now .
 thank chiu for reading .
 were chiu crying as chiu were typing the csb ?
 knn wasted my time reading  .

 no chemistry still want to hold her hands  .
 and your csb like she was the one pursuing chiu  .
 more like chiu meatbao her sibo 
 amy was very unladylike
 but did u learn anything from this experience ?
 if not ,  it is a waste of your time and oso our time (for reading this) .
 why do chiu need to harp on this unpleasant experience ?
 chiu are a pervert .
 ok la bo liao ,  this kind read a bit is ok isnt it ?
 chiu csb not impt  .
 by the way amy xiong la

 the employment letter usually write during probation either party can terminate the contract by serving 2 weeks notice period or paying 2 weeks salary in lieu of notice period .
 after confirmation either party can terminate the contract by serving 1 month notice period or by paying 1 month notice salary in lieu of notice period .
 so if company says chiu got poor performance ,  chiu are not being confirmed during probation and ask chiu to leave immediately ,  are they required to pay chiu extra 2 weeks salary in lieu of notice period ?
 base on your appointment letter .
 so if company dont pay 2 weeks ask chiu disappear .
 chiu can approach mom or personal lawyer .
 they can 101 reasons to terminate u without compensation .
 u wont get a cent but waste your time
 a serious accident involving 2 tower transit buses has caused sbs 6403h to flip towards its side .
 bukit batok bus interchange’s endon berths are currently not operating as rescue workers are working tirelessly to treat the injured personnel and recover the accident bus .
 we sincerely hope that no one has suffered serious injuries  .
 side note: the facts of this accident has yet to be ascertained and we would recommend waiting for official news publications instead of making unconfirmed speculations .
 vtec just kicked in yo ,  oh wait it’s a bus .
 sources say :  .
 we sincerely hope that no one has suffered serious injuries
 no safe distancing .
 all real time reporter ?
 or collecting breaking news for their social media ?
 aiyah too late for 4d
 wtf ,  the oni way this could happen is if the driver is speeding and tried to do a drifting turn .
 else so low centre of gravity ,  how to overturn like this to the side ?
 what kind of bus driver did they employed ?
 remove those stupid railings and put stone bollards lah
 never copyright your photo .

 passengers are being rescued from the toppled bus ,  while the bus that impacted the toppled vehicle the right is here .
 there is no information of the casualties or any deaths yet .
 currently works are under way to rescue the victims .
 so many reporters taking photos
 cant load the images .
 is it double decker ?
 he thought i want him to ot 
 seems like chiu no life ,  so many threads on a sunday ,  quite poor thing
 do they have the rights
 got how many outlets ah ?
 the tiong fried lice ah ?
 so far i oni tried at bedok and it is damn oily but got eggy fragrance .
 the meat cutlet is a little dry n thin .
 can beat dtf fried rice with their juicy pork chop ?
 oni know slumdok gotch one .
 the dtf at slumdok mall uplorry but this stall business seem to be picking up
 suggest u eat the fish&chips from the same coffee shop as hlk
 think he meant texas lone star .
 at the right corner of the coffee shop .
 the stall name is texas lone star
 not really ,  tried it a few times .
 find it to be oily ,  pork chop is inferior to dtf nah .
 rent & own in the same sentence 
 we are renting for 99 years .
 ya they dunno it’s 99-years leasehold property
 heng i staying in fh landed .
 just dont kena the land acquisition act can liao  .
 heng not near/along any main road whereby  &apos;widening of public roads &apos; can be used as a reason .
 renting is indirectly paying for the owners .
 99 year is oso just a lease .
 chiu beat me to it .
 preparing us for the inevitable future where locals rent from ceca
 dont worry ,  gahment have never compensated anyone less than what they paid the ppty for under land acquisition act
 most properties in singapore are leasehold up till 99 years oni .
 after that ,  no more value liao unless the lease has been extended .
 ya lor somemore no pictures .
 ts y so despo ,  next time spray a little deodorant ,  not too much .
 hi ,  this is amy .
 im sorry if chiu cant handle the truth .
 you &apos;re a pervertic pervert of the 1st degree .
 just give her a good one la why u so stuck up
 lol forgot la ,  in wrong forum cos both side same nick mah
 almost wanted to stop reading at 3 years ago .
 but give the brother the support and finished reading the story .
 conclusion ,  just move on .
 my conclusion is ts doesnt look like a hunk la .
 if he looked like wlh ,  i think her reaction would be quite different .
 in before intro to edmw…… .
 yah ,  then maybe i too harsh .
 bo is a no no .
 before go out muz bathe at least .
 go out 1st time oredi try hold her hands .
 ts u scared she lost her way is it ?
 this one oso not kindergarten time 2 by 2 hold hands leh .
 liddat cannot la .
 chiu should has goes straight for the most important course .
 it &apos;s true that i did make some missteps .
 i admit i came up short .
 but what i was upset about ,  was not that i came up short and she didnt want to continue dating me again .
 that i could accept .
 what i couldnt accept was that she then talked sheet about me behind my back ,  to other females who were our mutual friends .
 that was unkind and unnecessary .
 to me ,  if i were in her shoes ,  i would just keep quiet ,  i would try to protect the dignity of the other person .
 bo is a serious turn off .
 first time hold hands ,  hunk maybe can .
 bbfa ,  better not .
 actually i think all girls will talk .
 it &apos;s just the human nature .
 so one learning point is that whatever chiu do ,  be prepared that they will talk .
 even what chiu do in bed .
 i guess very traumatising for the lady to be smelling the bo for whole duration of 2 hour movie ?
 so complain to friend about it loh .
 best to something about the bo - shower before date ,  deodorant ,  lose some weight .
 look at it in another way .
 if your fren never give u feedback ,  would u have known that u got bo issue ?
 would u still wanna try hold hands with other girls 1st time go out (apart from kindergarteners) ?
 daryl uncle what’s your bike forum nick  
 how come now then chiu tell us ?
 eh ,  first date don’t know the girl well ,  still want to be touchy ,  of cos she will warn her girl friends about chiu la .
 that’s not talking sh .
 it ,  it’s telling the truth and not wanting her friends to suffer her fate .
 pfizer expects trial results for 5-11 year olds by sep; followed by results for 2-5 year olds; and finally for the 6 months to 2 year olds by november this year .
 fda of usa require 2 months of follow up data for emergency use approval ,  and 6 months of follow up data for full authorisation for use .
 these trials involve use of smaller doses ,  including paediatric doses for infants from 6 months up .
 meanwhile ,  israel is going ahead to offer vulnerable children under 12 even before trial results or before formal regulatory authorization .
 this is supposed to be 1/3 dose of 10ug instead of the usual 30ug dose for teens and adults .
 vulnerable children include those with various health conditions like heart ot lung issues ,  transplant patients ,  or those at heaviest 1% of bmi obesity index .
 israel had done similar earlier with the vulnerable younger teens ,  authorising in effect special emergency for younger teens 12-15 years old ,  the pfizer shot ,  even before the pfizer phase 3 trials completed their run .

 a good respect u as a fellow human being ,  must be fair ,  must not be menipulative ,  must not have favorism ,  when wrong admit ,  must not be petty ,  and reward the staff hardwork ,  be humble ,  understand the staff ,  lead by example ,  made used like a his personal slave ,  do not force to do unreasonable request like u cannot finish your daily work and he comes in and tell u to do another work knowing it is impossible for u to complete .
 sadly majority of local sinkie boss(managers) can never have the quality cos they are heartless human being .
 so far i oni found one manager who i really respect and she is way younger then me .
 tell people chiu wanna laosai ,  see who gives chiu toilet roll… .
 what yr age group and why dont want kid
 liddat better find other job liao .
 waste of time .
 see your feels .
 this one u have to ask yourself .
 u worked there for x yrs & by now should be able to evaluate your worth or what u deemed that u should be deservin &apos; of .
 the ball &apos;s in your court ,  so to speak 
 if chiu can find other job with higher pay and better work environment/benefits ,  just leave .
 no such thing as loyalty to company .
 there is nothing worth or not worth ,  as long chiu feel your salary is at your comfort zone .
 the rest is oni make use of each other .
 chiu just do what chiu get paid .
 if chiu want go extra miles make sure one day if your company do mess retrench on chiu ,  dont be sad .
 cos big company dont give chiu a fug .
 colleagues is always colleagues .
 once chiu leave the company the full stop is there .
 if chiu looking for eat drink chat kakis as long chiu got money sure there is many .
 i am planning to have a discussion with my boss soon .
 the last time i had the discussion with him he just kept saying wait .
 when i pressed on and asked for a concrete timing ,  he just said .
 see how la ,  maybe 3-4 years ?
 then towards the end add on ,  cant really say .
 must see if got opening or need to move me to another position .
 such answers just didnt make me feel very confident that they are actually committed to developing me .
 wow got this kinda boss will really be like struck lottery liao .
 i havent met any in both of my workplaces too .
 got one come quite close but too bad they moved me to another department before i managed to work closely with her 
 lol personal preference .
 haha sometimes i dunno if i am the one who is too demanding .
 talked to some friends .
 some said got job and can get paid esp during these few days very good oredi .
 who cares abt recognition ?
 just go work ,  go home n repeat .
 so not sure if i am expecting too much .
 no use deh ,  i feel .
 if they want promote u ,  they would have promote u without u asking .
 if they want fire chiu ,  they oso will give reason to justify it .
 at the end of the day ,  are u able to find other jobs outside with the same pay or even more ,  assuming chiu have the skill ,  experience and contacts from your current job .
 if job relak and not stressed and they pay quite ok ,  then just stay ,  but final decision is from chiu .
 just an advice .
 actually i just want to do the bare minimum but boss said if u r keen to progress ,  u need to take up more right ?
 so i agree and did all the projects to so-called prove myself .
 end of year ,  he said still not enough .
 i think maybe thats why so many of my colleagues dont like him and always talk bad whenever he &apos;s not ard .
 chiu in civil service right ?
 huai should the boss be committed to your progress unless it helps his progress ?
 if he is a farmer just waiting to collect pay every month ,  things remain status quo is best for him  .
 as for colleagues complaining about boss ,  this happens every where except it &apos;s more common in civil service where people are more free 
 someone has to do the work ,  right ?
 chiu are the chosen one 
 most of singapore companies even mnc is sama sama huan 
 not enough cos chiu are the oni work horse in the team mah .
 chiu dont do then who do ?
 please share a song for world mental health day 10/10
 i just wanted chiu to know .
 that this is me trying .
 at least im trying .
 a song about anxiety ,  depression and not being able to accept who chiu are .
 take care everyone ,  reach out to people chiu can trust if chiu need someone to talk to
 thats life by frank sinatra .

 what’s there to speculate ?
 if not speeding what else ?
 mods please assist to merge duplicate threads .
 how to do this ?
 driver got skill
 looks like the bus got broadsided .
 so there is more than one way this could had happened .
  &apos;the oni way this could happen &apos; assertion is incorrect .
 bus a bang bus b at the side .
 can see the dent .
 then bus b hit barrier drop down and land on side .
 banged in the middle chiu see the toppled bus can see a dent right in the middle .
 i thought it was double decker bus but come in saw is oni single bus .
 goes to show the driver must be a total noob to even topple a single bus
 is it bus sleepy ?
 1st hurdle for iswaran
 @dragonblack nice to see your google ad is working as intended !
 alot of tiong bus drivers drive like they are driving ferrari .
 bus a must be speeding that cause so much impact to bus b
 ok standby next few draws
 hopefully no one was near the spot where the bus bang
 please go there and catch all these people with no safe distancing .
 i see at least $60k free money
 driver can kiss his job goodbye
 a very good chance of csj to score some points with bb people  ,  hope he hear this accident first hand and fast hand fast leg go there to show concern  .

 which bus numbers is this  ?
 where is the 2nd bus > .
 yoy is 2 bus involved  ?
 same nick as edmw lor
 it &apos;s true ,  im the cinema seat !
 haha ts must have the chao sng smell ,  poor amy .
 ts i curious at which point chiu tried to hold her hands and why ?
 did chiu think she gave chiu the signal to go ahead ?
 the oni course that ever matters with your course mate is intercourse .
 u got many stories sia
 in before amy thread
 why did chiu stand so close and try to hold her hand ?
 and why never took bath before the date
 what story line chiu wanted wor ?
 amy understands why there was no competition .
 for first date chiu should oni concentrate in having fun and leave a good impression for a second date to follow .
 no touchy no bo .
 chiu must be rushing to piak her .
 the other kind of storyline  .
 ts u never have gf isit ?
 girls gossip ,  an thats what they do when they gather ,  unlike guys .
 maybe u should get a bf if cant accept ,  solve your problem .
 so u are charlie
 no way i will follow .
 when cases are dropping chiu go import cases in record numbers .
 community cases are oredi going up as a result .
 since chiu mofos are so hell bend on another wave ,  thats your problem ,  not mine .
 just doed as gahment sayed ok… dont jjww oyk thanked chiu for hitting his kpi for year end bonus  
 prease don’t follow the mask rule hor
 chiu dont follow then stay at home lor .
 nobody ask chiu to come out .
 gahment say what we must guai guai follow ok ?
 eh why no follow .
 edmw all 1 big blarder
 got flat to pay some more .
 what are the things to look out for ?
 meanwhile look for new job attend a few interviews by the time they fired chiu there oredi other job for chiu to fall on
 i mean mom ,  and severance package .
 go search on mom website la come here ask n go there look no difference .
 no wonder tiopok .
 nothing much chiu can do .
 company can just pay chiu the notice period or tell chiu to serve out your notice .
 severance is not compulsory in singapore ,  it &apos;s oni a recommendation .
 best to just start your job search
 hope for the best but prepared for the worst
 asked them whether retrenchment or normal termination by notice
 it &apos;s retrenchment ,  hope chiu be doing fine .
 try look for other job ,  meanwhile go and use your skill future to attend lesson or get a taxi driver license .
 find another job
 ask for 1 month per year of service .
 if they don’t give ,  threaten to go to mom 
 nowadays is norm to send hundreds of job applications 
 not mandatory to give
 talk to your union .
 some place pay 1 month notice regardless how many years u work .
 very smelly one
 some even not pay
 bedok reservoir certainly wont be your first or last choice .
 pay one month and ask u to leave immediately lor
 i was terminated before ,  no severance package .
 is it retrenchment or made redundant ?
 either way hope the compensation package is equitable .
 if all fails ,  chiu can try  .
 reaching out to useless tafep .
 most jlb agency at the moment .
 does it taste different from others ?
 oni tried before new moon ,  hock hua ,  horse brand and calmex (long ago la) .
 what about those chef or whatever brand
 about the same if chiu ask me
 u eating rubbers ah
 abalone always taste fresh one nicer ,  some say at one jhj ,  some prefer vietbu .
 abalone got taste one meh ?
 unless u talking the other type of abalone
 sinkies &apos; overpriced abalone .
 i asking cos got people tell me skylight taste not nice or different .
 i a bit scared to use it to cook or gifting
 golden chef quite decent  .
 if can wait see got more discount anot .
 i dunno what they mean by taste not nice but i know new moon can be rubbery if u choose the nz ones .
 the horse brand or hock hua is chewable not too tough .
 how about dino bu ?
 should all taste similar .
 how different can canned abalone taste
 if unwashed usually is awful taste 
 i suspect this oso .
 and i think some brands maybe is rebranded ones ?
 since they got smaller market and facility ?
 means the bigger brands rebrand for them like oem
 i do suspect maybe those smaller chains of tcm maybe is rebranded ?
 maybe reach some agreement with the processing facility overseas which oversees the bigger line for the bigger brands like new moon etc .
 got fishy smell ?
 some is gold ,  some platinum and some diamond 
 just buy one and try la how much only
 u try ignore her maybe she let u try for free
 no management will do this .
 promotion means increase in celery budget .
 doesnt look good for hod 
 and compare vegetable prices with them ?
 means ts stay there with no hopes of promotion .
 boss oni sweet talk to lure ts to do more job but without advancement ,  promotion or increment in salary .
 $$$ is most practical tbh
 the celery is the appeciation and recognition from your company .
 it &apos;s just a transaction 
 why would they promote u to give u the opportunity to displace them in the future  ?
 nowsaday chiu want promotion chiu jump ship .
 very little chance of internal promotion huan 
 not if he tank the work but boss claim all the credit 
 chiu are oni as good as your latest piece of work 
 career is just a illusion to keep chiu running on the treadmill .
  unless chiu are starting something on your own .
 a job is just something people give chiu ,  without people to give chiu a job .
 your career is nothing but smoke .
 it is oni different if chiu are your own boss ,  else is just same sai different smell and color maybe higher pay some where else .
 whether chiu still have the sai or dont have the sai .
 is still dependent on people willing to give chiu the sai in the first place .
 else simi career are chiu talking about ?
 for (2) ,  nowsaday they dont backstab chiu like fts chiu can arm chio oredi .
 huai should they help chiu to move up at their sexpense ?
 (3) your boss is oredi in his comfortable zone and cep oredi ,  your purpose is just to remain where chiu are so he can remain where he is 
 work in a place where u feel u can make meaningful contribution and constructive work ,  and where u are fairly paid .
 unless chiu plan to settle down in this company until retirement ,  chiu better move now .
 once chiu hit late 30s ,  chiu wont want to move le 
 nicely put in another way .
 salaried employees have this illusion that .
 they are in control of their own time and workload .
 that is absolutely false .
 the little so called flexibility given by your boss .
 to execute your task and finish it by your own time .
 has emboldened many workers to think they have .
 broken the ceiling .
 as long as you’re not running your .
 own business ,  you’re still under the finger of the person .
 dishing out your salary .
 he tell chiu do a chiu do a .
 he pay chiu b chiu get b .
 the oni freedom chiu have is to find new job .
 but it’s back to the same sai theory again .
 it is alright to be demanding if u work very hard and that is the motivation  to get better prospect cos u deserve it .
 if your boss failed to see this the 1st year maybe u can close one eye maybe next year he can see but the next year he still pretend nothing happened then it is not your fault if u go for another company .
 developing people is not the most pleasant thing to do  .
 my former boss will vouch to this .
 she manages me until she sibei stressed and broke down .
 tiagong she got better oni after she pok me 
 private or public sector ?
 yes ,  we at edmw are always available 
 even they give promotion like few hundred ,  confirm squeeze chiu gao gao deh .
 like give $500 increment ,  will want chiu to earn back 2-3k per month for them or cover mountain and sea .
 that why i said if job slack ,  then stay bah .
 no stress mah .
 increment does not mean worth it to stay .
 asgm=ai sio gan mai
 asgm = ai sio gan mai .
 appm = ai piak piak mai .
 both same meaning .
 still got 1 is smrjrpj ?
 asgm = ai sio gan mai .
 appm = ai piak piak mai .
 both oso mean  &apos;sex ?
 smrjrpj = simiran jiao ran pa ji
 and all the while i thought this meant post count whore .

 over half of koreans aged between 40 and 64 indebted .
 more than half of south koreans aged between 40 and 64 held debt last year as more people took out loans to buy homes amid skyrocketing housing prices ,  data showed tuesday .
 jin cham thats why need squid game
 singapore oso got alot of people take home loans .
 until gahment must introduce cooling measures 
 who did they vote for ?
 sinkieland will be alot more than half 
 most koreans dont buy properties so they dont even take up home loans at all ,  whereas almost all sinkies aspire to be homeowners ,  thats the difference .
 entire world is drowning in debt la ,  its just a matter of who is carrying that debt oni .
 no country is safe from higher interest rates ,  which is exactly why interest rates will never go appreciably higher ever again ,  not in my lifetime at least .
 of course they are indebted to the americans that saved them from the commie north korea .
 still got kimchi to eat  ?
 singapore definitely more than 50% indebted .
 even if 100% use cpf oso need to repay accrued interest
 not news liao leh 
 article says they take home loan .
 scam perpetuated by zhaborl
 they can apply for credit card without payslip .
 loan given without control .
 and multiple loans/cards allow from diff bank and financial institutions  .
 dont live in seoul lor .
 all those who got their hdb in their 20s ,  indept for 30yrs
 many rich sinkie buying condos .
 this accured interest has been repeating in edmw for tons .
 quite well known .
 rich poor gap is wide there
 this is the time where we must shout loudly .
 must watch with headphones .
 can hear the saliva sounds      .
 life is so easy when chiu look good .
 as of now ,  nfts and cryptos are still tax free .
 psp oredi buay song sinkies earning money from cryptos ,  now still use nfts to earn .
 i think sooner or later pap sure implement some way to tax these .
 just horny male supporters no diff from onlyfans or those ktvs buying flower garlands .
 being a pretty girl really is like living with cheat code .
 take some photos of yourself and boom $7 .
 ironic world we live in
 in singapore ,  as a female just dont be fat oredi can have simps putting chiu on a pedestal liao .
 see ,  there is simply no excuse for not being able to earn money .
 so stop complaining about being poor .
 as with most nft projects ,  the teams will start by buying initially to kickstart the trade .
 after that the market will carry on itself liao .
 bigqing &apos;s nft is mooning cos some famous whales like logan paul bought alot of her nfts and those people posted on social media about it ,  thus making everyone fomo into buying .
 i is sibei speechless what’s up with my life
 i cannot understand what is the value of the nfts .
 is it just hype and speculation ?
 pefect example of pretty privilege .
 being born a beautiful person is one of the greatest advantage one can have .
 sometimes more advantageous than being born into a rich family .
 people in general tend to over-rate wealthy family background .
 like if someone comes from a wealthy family background achieve somethk in life ,  people will make all sort of nasty comments & discredit the person &apos;s effort .
 but actually pretty people have a huge quiet advantage in life that people tend to commonly over-look .
 as valuable as right click ,  save
 why she dont do onlyfans !
 this one just snap photos and sell .
 can even use old photos .
 onlyfans ,  youtube etc still have to talk ,  act friendly
 of cant get chiu 8million in 1 week
 bigqing started selling her nfts 2 weeks ago and oredi made millions .
 onlyfans oso cannot earn so much .
 even news call her fans as “simps” !
 but onlyfans oso can earn big bucks mah .
 anyway ,  stupid people buying her nfts la .
 not like she is super famous or what .
 i mean she is pretty but tons of people with her looks around .
 esp in onlyfans .
 lmao at the stupid people buying her nfts
 must go out the house for fresh air 
 tanjung pagar road

 not surprise if tomorrow many members of the public starts arguing they are fully vaxxed and demand to dine in restuarant .
 hahaaha many people still dunno is need +14 days after second jab then is fully vaxxed
 i bet the spg paid for the ticket for the angmo

 keep this thread ,  watch tomotrow .
 wa good watch thanks
 heard stories that gotch some hair and nails still grow after so long ,  dunno true or not
 most prob is the skin under the nails or hair shrink .
 thus revealing more parts of the nails or hair underneath .
 giving the impression of growth
 i was about to watch then suddenly my brother turn the light off .
 the coffin good quality
 quite horrible lor rather watch 2morrow .
 cannot imagine the smell
 wa thanks ts good share .
 so just curious ,  means cemetery in singapore oso lease hold ah .
 why need to exhumed ?
 maybe ran out of oxygen to complete the decomposition process .
 cause all bacteria died and process stops .
 dont dare click   
 later the corpses become pocongs to jump around .
 they say 15-20 years later must dig out .
 means the coffin is really of very high quality until cannot decompose ?
 gahment policy to compulsory exhumation after 15yrs
 y so many people ask if i am crone .
 low post count does not mean i am newbie .
 have been lurking in a few forums for quite some time .
 recently created an account to ask some questions in m600i thread .
 then look look see see in edmw and got quite confused with the language here .
 some can still guess from context ,  others google ,  but still have many weird terms .
 making this list so newcomers to edmw will not get so blur .
 ask = ah sia kia  ?

 hope ts finds new job soon if that’s what he needs .
 reporting officer never warn before this ?
 maybe reporting officer oso on chopping board soon .
 mgmt and employer - well ,  in a twisted way ,  all same - they don’t bother with services or loyalties .
 they oni want to look good now ,  never past achievements or contributions ,  future plans ?
  well ,  they oni care about their plans for themselves
 singapore labor law ,  no need compensation ,  suck thumb
 future pres is supportive of food delivery .
 of course there is phv choice .
 or security as last choice
 non renewal of contract ,  termination ,  redundancy or retrenchment  ?
 it matter on your income tax .
 and redundancy and retrenchment ,  they have to report to mom as well .
 who did chiu vote last ge ?
 the most common questions will ask
 yes go mom ,  most employers are scared of them ,  especially recently cos they got covid grants .
 i am assuming chiu sinkie ,  if not good luck .
 he probably voted opp but sadly none of them speak up on ceca since elected
 not mandatory but there should be reasonable severance package  .
 this one can fight ,  don’t give up .

 zaobao reported liao says got people injured .
 likely bus out of control or driver cardic arrest .
 the impact would be that great to make the bus toppled over  .
 wonder how the other bus capt hit it in such a way ,  espc at a bus intc settings
 one of the bus bang into the other bus closer to the fence area and thus running the other bus to fall into the lower area toppling it on the side .
 finally the numbers of the bus is released .
 and ,  plenty of income opportunity for @broadwalk shu shu in bukit batoh .
 let &apos;s just wait for further updates .
 sometimes we cant just pin point the blame directly at the bus co .
 maybe new driver 1st day at work or somethin &apos;  .
 wa 6403 number in cantonese is 6 die 0 survive
 looks damn serious .
 ok ,  i din see the side fence dropped off so thought the bus driving below can suddenly flipped to the side
 exactly ,  and they like to stamp the brake in a sudden manner as if the inertia of bus is same as a sedan car  
 mcm bukit timur ni
 life of a reporter: tio kan by police is everyday life 
 this is the bus that sent the other bus flying to the bottom slope .
 wa so lihai manage to flip bus

 i thought it was a man bus that hit the mercedes bus .
 chee soon juan got rush down ?

 this bus driver gg liao .
 prepare to go squat .
 i like skylight .
 nicer than new moon of course .
 the australian one is nicer (pink can) .
 i buy fresh abalone
 raw abalone tastes the best
 i no money le brother ,  can buy for me ?
 must eat with facai to mask the musk .
 but some people like the musk
 while some are just plain hairy   
 ya this kind of practice is quite common .
 one factory will use the same item and rebrand for different companies .
 last time even lim chee guan oso asked another company help them prep bakkwa ,  think was in the papers .
 now dunno read last time they took it back and do their own processing liao .
 so im wondering actually those abalone or bakkwa taste test or those shrimp roll ,  got what difference .
 i dont believe bch or many other brands actually make the product themselves .
 oni slap on the name nia .
 or generally produce roughly same thing ,  but add in small change to ingredient but not much diff
 nothing beats fresh from the source .
 got blood come out ?
 then why r some selling so expensive ?
 u all damn childish leh ,  people talk about canned abalone u all talk so dirty
 the sauce that come together or brand nia .
 boss don’t keep to his promises .
 just need a sai kang warrior to make him look good and u r the one
 how u know another place will be better ?
 the boss is getting his fat bonus for getting ts to handle more work with the same pay and no promotion .
 if chiu want to see it in a good len ,  ts gained the experiences in tackling more projects .
 if chiu want to see it in a bad len ,  ts have been taken for a ride .
 when chiu feel chiu are no longer passionate or excited about going to work for weeks .
 when chiu no longer see any opportunities to grow personally .
 when chiu no longer see the need or perhaps ,  the  &apos;fire &apos; to want to do well .
 these could be some of the many signs that chiu need to move on .
 but if u keep feeling the same way in the past few orgs u worked for ,  chances are chiu could be better off starting a business .
 1) likely no position for chiu to move up  .
 2) colleague never backstab (or maybe chiu don’t know) oredi very lucky liao .
 continue your way of not mixing colleague and friends r/s t .
 3) u have been a great worker .
 why should your boss move chiu up when chiu are doing the ground work well and making him looks like his management skill is great .
 chiu are just 1 of his pawn to get a bigger and fatter bonus from top management .
 by the way ts should share what industry chiu are in .
 think people will give a better comment / shadings .
 some industry need to keep move and some requires constant upskilling to move up or stay relevant  .
 and ts do chiu have the softskills to move up ?
 people at middle - top management usually have high eq to smoke ,  plan  ,  management even higher ups expectation to survive .
 life is very different at the top and ground level .
 believe chiu have but not well sharpen yet .
 cheers and hagw
 u got your answer/hints from him there oredi .
 u still dont catch/get it ?
 or u &apos;re still reluctant to leave & in the hope that your chance will come .
 me thinks it &apos;s time for u to find another one & prove your worth [if u think u are] to other potential employers .
 then wait for their call .
 rather than wait for your boss &apos;s  .
 which might be forever  .
 for now u just hang on til &apos; u get a new one
 for those who have started their own business ,  how do chiu know the time is right ?
 i have always run the show in my company ,  bring in most revenue ,  develop new products ,  drive sales and operations .
 but forever not appreciated by ceca boss ,  always rewarding her pet .
 milf with good curves and good dress sense makes your day…
 cos there is something call bell curve .
 if chiu do 100 marks for your jobscope ,  that is a given ,  and good for everything for year end appraisal .
 but just nice ,  your colleagues ,  5 of them all do until 120 marks for their work .
 a company can oni promote 5 people ,  so they will  &apos;cut queue &apos; and suddenly place ahead of chiu .
 beside performance ,  there could be other reason ,  like for e .
 there is oso another guy score 90 marks ,  but he is very crucial to that project ,  if he resign ,  the rest of the team member cannot tank + not enough time to hire new people ,  the barrier of entry is too high .
 he threaten to resign if no promotion by end of the year ,  aka hold the company at their ball ,  whereas ,  u are more  &apos;expendable &apos; ,  this can be oso another reason why they give reason like  &apos;not enough &apos; .
 in term of promotion ,  there is not so much transparency ,  there is alot of human factor involved one .
 sometimes dont blame your boss la ,  he sometimes oso cannot do much
 well ,  chiu are steel holding on to your jod ,  arent chiu ?
 feel like throwing letter ,  offset with leave accumination from covid and watch the coy burn .
 however ,  unwise to quit cos of emotional reasons
 the company is probably going to do .
 better without chiu .
 chiu shouldn &apos;t have any illusions that .
 chiu are indispensable .
 a corporate entity will always .
 have unlimited advantages over one single salaried employee .
 chiu can apply for another job ,  get offer and ask company to match .
 sometimes people dont value chiu until some other company wants chiu .
 but in the first place if your job performance and aptitude makes chiu easily replaceable ,  better not play this card .
 most of my friends said the same thing too .
 i guess will be difficult to find a boss who would want to work hard to help me progress .
 next workplace i will try to take it easy and dont do so much anymore
 not say cannot  .
 chiu must see what is your boss &apos; weakness is ,  what will make him kanchiong and need to be on his feet .
 then  &apos;advise &apos; him in a way that he thinks he need chiu for his survival  .
 then chiu can function as his consultant but remember the story of arabian nights .
 dont lay all your cards down at once .
 disclose a little every day to keep him hanging on  .
 spend some time tonight to think of a plan ba 
 look for a better company and once u get the offer ,  revisit this topic again .
 i am still passionate about what i am doing but yea ,  it is getting affected by doing the same thing year in year out ,  while seeing people who do lesser get promoted and recognised instead
 add on … if chiu got big mortgage loan and car loan or whatsoever loan
 no guarantee la .
 so now split between taking the risk n go or just staying and see how .
 if i know for sure ,  i wont start this thread 
 i remember her from the insurance days .
 iq is most overrated… please find good quality genes siam bu or vietbu or atb to breed .

 the  &apos;fault &apos; lies with vast number of incredibly stupid moron guys ,  i .
 they are the very morons who created this vast disparity in terms of advantage that pretty women enjoy shamelessly in this society .
 for example ,  i do not follow subscribe or like any of these influencer &apos;s social media profile .
 i oni support those who puts out tangible concrete contents .
 if more people are like me ,  there will be nothing that these sluts can leverage on .
 but the unfortunate reality is - few people are like me .
 majority of guys are like- pretty gal > like & follow> spend entire fortune to support the influencer > the influencer goes on to live a super high ses lifestyle with her tall handsome beau while the majority of her simp followers continue living their mudane life day in day out

 ah gui want sell nft oso but need pay gas fee even before i start
 your rsm will willing become ah-gua to have 7 .
 dont make ethereum nfts .
 make solana nfts .
 should be around $3 oni per nft .
 after that u come edmw and try to sell for $3k
 my rsm very serious type of person 
 of big bucks but definitely not 8million (especially if chiu dont strip) .
 they are not stupid la .
 there are oni 3 people who buy her nft .
 1) people who adore her (same as people who buy kobe bryant stuff cos level of adoration is the same .
 2) people who buy then flip to make a profit .
 3) people buy nft for money laundering (very very prevalent) .
 solves their legal problems .
 so looking at it ,  buying her nfts is a smart move as it brings chiu more pros then cons .
 so actually it is chiu who is stupid
 lol ,  alot of people don’t know how nft works ,  nor do they understand the minting process .
 the initial nft were minted for free .
 her team most likely earns that 10% royalty on all transactions by opensea .
 current transaction volume is about 2 .
 3k eth ,  so 10% is around 230 eth or around 800k sgd plus minus .
 share with her team ,  i think she will still earn a few hundred k .
 if she owns any of her tokens ,  then could be higher .
 but i read somewhere that she does not hold any .
 oso ,  many projects start of by trading among friends or ownself buy ownself .
 that’s why the trading volume for her nft is tapering off .
 likely an initial hype , l from the marketing .
 actual demand might be low .
 if go back cheena ,  she will probably kena common prosperity .
 and given how cheena outright ban crypto ,  i doubt nfts will last long .
 then she cant even cash out .
 this rock worth more than that .
 this could just be a marketing hype ,  and she could be transferring those eth back to her biggest buyer
 chiu have a point but singapore oso not say very crypto friendly wa .
 regulations getting tighter and tighter .
 should go to the us or some european country instead .

 bookmark to watch tomorrow
 the preservatives were injected during the funeral to orevent the body from rotting .
 after that the burial .
 those newer graves have their own individual concrete slots ,  after the coffin is laid down ,  it is sealed in concrete and tiled up .
 it &apos;ll take a very very long time to decompose .
 usually if the flesh still present ,  will need to put into a new coffin for cremation .
 nowadays the grave diggers are from myanmar .
 very few locals do it ,  at most is supervising .
 one of the comment mentioned that the muslims dont cremate .
 so their deceased have to exhume too ?
 humans are alot more scarier .
 mudderfuggers who torture other humans daily are scarier
 watched all part 1 to part 3 .
 very interesting leh
 woah this one quite badly waterlogged .
 my uncle dug up after 25yrs ,  part of the coffin waterlogged but not as bad as this .
 body still fully intact ,  oni the ankle area one hole due to decomposition .
 hair still black and face macam alive .
 his coffin is good and the padding is thick ,  kept the body above water .
 gold watch leather shoes etc all swee swee .
 wa didnt know got other parts .

 so this site is where new hdb will be in the future ah ?

 and yeah 2nd and 3rd part not as bad as 1st part .
 those become bones already
 haha i humji .
 tomorrow laaaaa few more hours nia
 watched one before
 if chiu think about it ,  the human body is just a meat balloon holding all our insides together .
 when we die， it looks like those soggy plastic bags drenched in rain/mud after half decompose process .
 so we are basically plastic bags that are alive .
 i thought it would be like damn squeamish or what .
 and that is what - if we opt for burial ,  is what we will become .
 our eternal sleep .

 yup i recall a case w poor benefits ,  mom stepped in and benefits were improved .
 if it &apos;s a cheapo sme ,  do note the below .
 notify mom of retrenchment .
 if chiu have decided and will be going through a retrenchment exercise ,  chiu are strongly encouraged to submit a notice of retrenchment .
 it is mandatory for employers with at least 10 employees who have retrenched 5 or more employees within any 6-month period to notify mom of the retrenchment exercise .
 stop giving false hope .
 look at your company handbook or employment letter if any .
 how many years has ts worked in the company ?
 the mnc way  ,  official retrenchment plus severance package  .
 the sme family way ,  tekan chiu until u bth ownself throw letter .

 how fast a bus need to be to get toppled ?
 my laobu say is bus 945 that toppled .
 the one going into interchange .
 edit: seems like 945 is the one that bang the toppled bus .
 mounted kerb n toppled 
 no photography in interchanges except for personal purposes .
 why the sargent shout and point finger ?
 the reporter oso never crossed the line what  .
 the bus fell asleep ?
 driver &apos;s head was pinned under the railing .
 think finished liao .
 driver pak vaccine then side effect langa ?
 dropped from 2nd level ?
 she had to duck to step out of the cordon tape .
 oh please ,  all those bus otaku always at interchange filming and posting video on youtube for ad revenue .
 more like the staff are having power trip and bored so want to find people to gan .
 driver on right side ,  bus landed on left .
 head pin under barrier ?
 edit: saw the video .
 could be another driver walking there(sometimes they smoke break there) .
 edit 2: oh ,  head not under barrier la .
 towards the end of the video can see ,  hand moving .
 but probably broke some bones .
 sure got people injure .
 if u sit one one side and fall into another side .
 if chiu follow ,  then chiu oso know these bus otakus frequently tio chased off by staff .
 so what’s the issue here ?
 ok glad to hear that .
  if its those smoking driver really is dam sway .
 that rude and barbaric policeman .
 typical sinkie mentality .
 but when faced with real criminals like little india riot ,  will pee in the pants and run away like in 2013

 thankfully i oni have my house loan .
 dont believe in having a car haha
 batam is an industrial island ,  the tourism area is like 15% land mass of the entire island .
 i rather stay in jb them batam .
 good luck in getting robbed
 but can chiu stay there for good or not ?
 got money chiu can go anywhere .
 my friend married an indonesian and has a son .
 he has been staying in batam more than 15 years .
 his wife passed away about 10 years ago but he continues to stay there with his son .
 he bought a house and returns every month just for day trip to renew visa .
 last year the indonesians kicked him back cos of pandemic .
 now he &apos;s stuck in sg
 is it easy to get an indonesian pr visa ?
 i dont think so .
 from what i heard other countries dont give them out like candies ?
 my friend has been staying in batam under social visit pass .
 i think he mentioned it &apos;s like impossible to get pr ?
 got sinkie citizenship to come back with him ?
 or didnt apply to siam ns ?
 where &apos;s his son now ?
 my friend &apos;s the low education type .
 not sure if singapore will give his son any status .
 the kid has never left batam before .
 i think he just turned 18 and got his indonesian ic or something last year
 $$ can give chiu ic/passport whether official or not .
 your friend so innocent .
 still in batam staying alone while his dad &apos;s stuck in sg
 if someone has a job in the tanjong pagar area or tanah merah area it would be perfect to stay in batam and commute by ferry daily .
 yearly ferry pass oni 2000 bucks
 i dont think he wants that .
 he &apos;d have to renounce singapore ?
 he still gets all the benefits from us ?
 i know an old guy who ran a maid agency who lives in batam .
 batam is not really safe to be honest it &apos;s very crime ridden and your chances of getting mugged in a year is almost 100%
 actually if u want a second home kl or bkk would be the best (1-2h via air) .
 for beach side locations there are oso other options .
 for country side or small city japan actually is great
 jb is alot safer than batam .
 they will definitely rob u esp if your singapore chinese .
 for jb u probably can still survive a year crime free if your v careful
 got one edmwer i remember stay those perm
 i wont say i am a very people person ,  not naturally extrovert but i do mingle and friendly enough with colleagues .
 plus i do help them out every now and then so most of them are oso quite open to helping me out la .
 this year they let me manage a team and the work gets done .
 these few years difficult to start bro .
 unless chiu have capital and willing to tong the risk
 if getting promotion is what chiu want ,  chiu should start working towards it .
 dont by shy to talk to your line manager ,  express your interest to take on more responsibilities .
 plenty of resources online on how to approach and various techniques on how to speak to your bosses and talk to them about promo ,  pay increment .
 good luck dude .
 end of the day it depend what kind of people ts are .
 if u promoted u are comfortable to talk to those management level people ?
 some1 transfer out last nov then i got to take over his team ,  otherwise i am likely to be stuck too  .
 after take over this tiny team of 3 people likely need 2 years before promoting   .
 waiting and waiting .
 last year i ask moi boss if i do masters organization will sponsor me bo (with bond) ?
 hint hint a bit .
 (cos they will oni sponsor u if u are deemed good enough to take on higher appointment) .
 if boss reject then u know ,  can pack bag liao
 new business (corporate training) im thinking of is actually better done during recession or down time ,  not a bad time to start
 i believe that he oredi did that .
 that is why his boss arrowed him so much projects and still did not promote him .
 what chiu recommended him is the textbook answer .
 his boss is just exploiting his eagerness for promotion .
 it is a good time to cross examine yourself on whether chiu are suitable to be a boss .
 it is not something chiu want to start and chiu can do it .
 chiu need to have the personality and character to do it or else chiu are just creating another shix hole for yourself .
 yeah ,  even when chiu are overworked and try to request for ease workload ,  the boss will say  &apos;i have to give chiu more workload to justify recommending your promotion; but i cant guarantee your promotion cos final decision still lies with the higher management &apos; .
 chiu are working like a cow while your colleagues are slacking down there .
 would suggest chiu to go think again if chiu still want to stay another year to see if chiu can get promoted and continue to let the workload burn chiu out from within .
 why u keep thinking so much and not look for a new job first ?
 my work does require me to talk to management level people from other co .
 they work well with me cos i got the work done .
 management lvl in my own company has their own network .
 they tend to promote those who are close to them or their so-called inner circle .
 thats what i observe .
 yeap are u confident u can break into this  &apos;inner circle &apos; ?
 if u want to  &apos;network &apos; with those management people ?
 i am planning to go approach the top management (above my boss) for a private chat soon to see what is the direction the company has for me .
 esp since i have just completed a big project .
 from there ,  i think i will make up my mind .
 if even top management no clue on what to do with me ,  what for stay .
 i honestly think i wont be good at running my own business haha .
 last resort maybe if i go third company still cmi .
 then i will seriously think about setting up my own business .
 yea ,  feels like it is all a scam to get me .
 to do more n more work with no additional reward .
 and best is not much guidance given - if something goes wrong ,  it will be my fault .
 if everything goes right ,  they will claim credit for giving me the opportunity and  &apos;guiding &apos; me
 to my own experiences most local born sgrean who do these horrible things to other sgrean it in their culture i really hate working with them .
 oni very few local sgrean who are really nice people who treat me like a human being and a friend .
 honestly my 4 years woking in finance company the majority are foreigners they never once take advantage of me they treat me like a human being .
 after i left singapore and i work with australian i oso have a good time they lagi relak relax time to work they work time to go home we all ho home on time !
 best working experiences too .
 this current co ,  most likely very difficult cos their cliques oredi well formed plus i oso started off at the wrong footing .
 enjoy life to the max !
 it’s favorism same with the horrible insurance i work with got this new guy every one or 2 years get promoted and can transfer to other departments cos my manager pull string for him .
 what happen was this new guy he oni had n level cert and my boss told other departments manager that this new guy can work and fast learner .
 mans cos my boss always do favour to these managers they cannot say no to him and give the new guy a chance .
 so this new guy he be doing a job which need at least a level cert .
 cut the story short after 5 months he can’t make it and had to go back to his old department .
 that time i oredi left the company and one of my ex colleagues told me this story .
 feels like more vaccine than covid so far ?
 and compared to how many last year ?
 dont be surprise this forum contributes to 50% of her 7 .
 moi want to merry irene if got chance .
 we sure have at least 4 kids together
 lmao if people think that her nft can make a profit .
 u mean her simps are so rich to spent few ten of thousands for a nft ?
 if so rich ,  might as well go for high class fl that look so much better than her .
 that is illegal .
 oni for those people to wash their black money .
 they have a ton of money to work with oredi ,  so they will never lose .
 nft and to some extent bitcoin have zero intrinstic value .
 u look at it u know le .
 they hire all the influenzers to hype it up .
 this is cos they need the hype to sustain their value .
 that is all to it .
 without hype ,  they have zero value .
 unlike a company ,  u can assess their intrinsic worth and see if it is a buy .
 but bitcoin and nft ?
 u see any influzers asking u to buy growth stocks or not ?
 cause is not making a profit for them !
 they tell u nft is good cause they not oni earned commission but can sell their own for millions of dollars too .
 i dont care if u wanna be a conman and con silly people (those who just join in for hype) of their money .
 but calling me stupid for dont understanding crypto and nft ?
 and u think bitcoin would really be the std form of currency in future ?
 bitcoin is speculative .
 is not stable as a currency .
 so no one would really use it to buy any fomo .
 imagine they used it to buy a 1 mil dollar house at $100k per bitcoin value ,  the next month ,  per bitcoin value could raise to $120k per bitcoin value ,  who would use it ?
 normal people would oni use cash .
 n imagine if per bitcoin is $100k ,  how is normal folks going to use it purchase stuff like coffee ?
 thus ,  is has no value and is purely gambling .
 nothing more to it .
 lol  ,  just right click save as image .
 seem to me nft is another hype using famous people to inflate their items .
 life is goot for chio bu in sg
 i think chiu forgot the simp part
 today i pray the simps will lose their virginity tonight .
 actually chiu miss out 1 .
 she/her team pump her own nft for advert .
 and attract more simps
 look at this idiot .
 i am sure a percentage is ownself buy ownself .
 happens to almost all nft collections
 downloading meitu to alter myself into a chio bu and mint into nfts now !
 if she show off her armpit and make nft ,  sure can earn a lot
 moi just want to merry her ,  do by arsehole raw or she swallow so cannot get pregnant .
 i want to merry her until her mascara stream down her pretty face .
 this kind never join military sibei wasted one lol .
 u cant even refute my points then call me an idiot .
 prepare to lose more money in nft la !
 by the way ,  it does not mean that i know what it is means i dont trade in it .
 after all ,  is a form of gambling and i have money to lose .
 but at least i not as evil as u .
 pretending it &apos;s all good when is oni speculative at best .

 kudos to ts for the effort !
 if chiu all like this so much ,  please help to upz and petition to make it sticky  
 added to list : .
 cim : come in me (usually used in a sexually context) .
 lawl : (sound word) pronunciation of lol
 just like mr vampire ?
 someone should start a trend for stupid ginna pi to lick corpses ,  should be entertaining to watch .
 clayish soil i think preserves better
 got la ,  but like the face quite preserved  first time moi see him oso ,  passed away when i was 1 
 not really true .
 my wife &apos;s uncle ancestor buried in bukit brown site but her uncle business until his era belly up liao .
 so not all site in bukit brown is of good fengshui one
 done that for both my grandpa and grandma  .
 both buried but tio disturbed and had to be exhumed .
 grandma was at blk 14b also
 looks decomposed internally cos body deflated .
 just that skin still intact
 if the weather is like -20 -30 degree .
 it will make this job look better and smell better
 huat da fark rah
 lol at the ahbeng  &apos;is it charge to the gahment ?
 yar not all site but chances kena bad site in lck is higher than bukit brown from what they say .
 wa the face still very recognizable .
 kudos to the folks doing the job in a dignified manner .
 when i was younger i didnt really understand cremation and thought it was cruel to turn someone to ashes .
 makes so much more sense now ,  and less administrative work for my descendants when im in an urn .
 even better ,  just scatter my ashes over the sea .
 made me realise does chinese vampire exist ,  those seen in shows
 folklores existed for a reason ,  either they are real or simply cannot be explained .
 upz for midnite viewing .
 wa respect the bone digger uncle .
 should interview him !
 upz for midnite viewing
 did they term it retrenchment or severance or golden handshake ?
 why wanna terminate ts ?
 faster go sign ntuc member ,  join union .
 buy life insurance
 no use ,  mom have to follow their own laws which is severance pay is not mandatory .
 whether chiu get it or not really depends on the generosity of your company or if your boss knows that severance pay is not mandatory .
 yes ,  there are some bosses out there still not sure if severance pay is mandatory just like some here .
 that is the fate of a sinkie employee .
 chiu can be cut loose any time even if chiu are the best worker .
 if the company want to kick ts ,  they should oredi have their official reason to release him .
 whether he is compensated or not ,  he have no control and no say .
 and cheng hu have no such worker protection here no matter what advert they are showing on tv .
 no good advice for ts since any one need some time to get over the retrenchment if he or she did nothing wrong or done everything well in their roles .
 it is a lonely battle with the inner demons .
 start collecting any incriminating evidence on the management be it accepting kickbacks from own staffs ,  suppliers or vendors .
 when the time comes u know what to do
 but why u & not others ?
 got angmo boss dunno .
 u say u will complain to mom .
 maybe will humji pay u more
 ts working in evergreen retrenchment seagate ?
 cant anyhow terminate wan .
 even though they just pay notice period .
 u can dont agree if your performance evaluation is not below par or u have no misconduct .
 chiu claimed to work in a bank .
 all the banks here have some sort of package .
 or isit from a job before chiu worked  &apos;back office &apos; in a bank ?
 during covid and desperate times ,  many do not even pay ,  even threaten that if chiu complain to mom ,   &apos;dont know what company can dig out on chiu ,  might even sue chiu for them eg .
 chiu took some office stuff for own use ,  eg .
 chiu print how many pcs of documents not meant for work using company copier etc !
 worst than very smelly !
 can anyhow terminate ,  just anyhow pick any minor mistake and make it a big deal ,  that is reason enough to terminate !
 wait till chiu see it with your own eyes or experience it ,  chiu will know how smelly what downright dirty creative tricks there can be .
 worst still ,  union support such tricks !
 who did chiu vote for ?
 someone oredi asked .
 moi asked too ,  who did chiu vote for ?
 many good years ahead 
 can get covid grant .
 maybe can install some virus on company network before u leave
 they outsource to overseas so no more worry on head count enough or not .
 no need pay cpf no need this n that due to law .
 this time sinkies jialat liao .
 all the users shoot email say they have been waiting for a few days but they never even received a single call from helpdesk or support engineer .
 should we ask our boss to sack the entire it helpdesk team ?
 what is the problem staff facing ?
 yes ,  please outsource them all
 not enough manpower la .
 sorry but moi phone spoil 
 very simple thread
 complain and cc the hod ?
 kena virus is it ?
 nose $ for antivirus ,  self quarantine rah
 this is your boss  .
 we are going into the direction of living without it sarpork .
 prease deal with it  
 is user problem .
 user supposed to ownself troubleshoot and fix at home
 is there a manager that oversees the helpdesk team ?
 hod will tell u it is not unexpected kym .
 very simpur thread spotted
  just dump the whole pc and import new one .
 u all dam satki , liddat oso can link
 its understandable if they are facing high turnover rate or insufficient manpower .
 but sometimes ,  its the support staff at location being lazy to attend to issues in person .
 these really need to be sacked and replaced with people with better work ethics .
 most helpdesk got portal to track progress .
 their response could be updated there .
 most users are lazy too .
 easier to blame others
 everything is about subtlety
 end users are sexpected to ownself reboot ownself  .
 software rna oredi installed ,  no horse run liao
 close down the department .
 invokes the t&c say users should first check the user manual and it’s not the supplier job to teach them how to read it .
 low ses oso can get if he applied early .
 jb safer ,  though i feel 1000x safer in bkk outskirts than jb .
 jb crimes commonly created by illegal immigrants .
 they look like local and at times speak like local so hard to differentiate .
 i had a couple of ex staff and both were robbed by a group of local gangsters though ,  in the wee hours to singapore .
 the auntie ended up hospitalized cos she is too fierce and tried to fight back .
 why chui guys if bolehland zoom in on jb/kl is penang not attractive meh ?
 msia got few cities quite nice actually .
 penang ,  ipoh ,  jb ,  kl .
 up to your preference .
 but msia if u in/out month by month ,  the kastum will starts to question why u kept going .
 will even warning chiu next time will bar chiu .
 batam so dangerous ?
 i always had the impression that it &apos;s safer than jb .
 so fast tio banned liao .
 most recent spammer .
 can spam up to 30 threads a day
 lol ,  still wondering whose crone is he though 
 so fast kena banned 
 papaya can use for anti smoking ads .
 dont smoke will not knock by bus .
 possible leaning against the railing then bus hit railing and he fall down together .
 cos if bus hit him against railing then not so simpur liao .
 whenevr got things happen ,  people onli take photo .
 hope no very elderly people in the bus ,  those 70s 80s years old one .
 they cannot take the impact one .
 hire more drivers from 3rd world countries la !
 if got video evidence ,  they cannot release a friendly version of the accident .
 remember the case of the apc crushing the landrover n tiong nsf ?
 mindef say cgalkenging terrain ,  photo shows flat ground .
 liddat really is sway until mai sway .
  imagine having your cig break happily on the railing area and than a bus came crushing towards u .
 mata shout at the cheena reporter for stepping crossing over the lockage tape but viewers all scold the police for being rude  
 she tio warn liao still try to step over the line/tape to film lol  .
 is live is live lol
 bus no seat belt somemore
 dont say too much ,  later kena points for being racist again .
 945 got many people take .
 young and old oso lazy .
 even one stop oso wanna take bus .
 nowadays all snowflakes can’t take the heat when ownself do wrong .
 any cctv footage ?
 or kaypoh people footage how it toh
 got 14 injured news just reported .
 if they wanted to ,  just impart their skills to ten people who can pay them 5000 each and these ten will open stalls and the precious recipes will go on for decades .
 but they just want money .
 quote: “it’s a pity that all the traditional food just goes down the drain &apos; .
 haha $1million  .
 say until heritage .
 $$$ faced say so la these hawkers .
 agree with u ,  if really find it a pity and want to pass down the recipe  ,  can impart their skills to many many hawkers at a token price so that the heritage continues .
 trying to use the bs reason to get more $$$ .
 this stupid narrative been perpetrated by media for years  .
 always lament hawkers are old ,   sick etc & want to retire .
 kids not interested .
 so the legacy  &apos;taste &apos; will vanish !
 if they want to pass down their father &apos;s recipe ,   just teach other people including prcs and malaysians .
 but why the reluctance ?
 obviously wants big dough
 actually every person for themselves  .
 i oso hope to hit the jackpot of $1million for my recipe if i am the hawker just like i hope to sell my  hdb for $1million .
 in this world ,  who is not greedy for $$$ ?
 they want the $$$ for retirement just say so la .
 no need to add these pitiful excuses like  &apos;the tradition or heritage gone .
 the food gone forever etc &apos; .
 the headline should read :  &apos;hawker intend to sell their recipe for handsome sum of money for their retirement &apos;
 sounds more like looking for money than looking for successor .
 this one is just ordinary food .
 dunno why can fetch such a pricing
 imagine paying 1 million ,  then he tell chiu the secret sauce is hard work and experience .
 dont take it the wrong way but i think hawker mostly about elbow grease ,  long hours and skills .
 rather than recipe or expensive ingredients .
 if its western media ,  they &apos;ll add : .
 price at 1 million but iras tax submission never touch 100 , 000 a year !
 how is 1 million reasonable ?
 i mean his dad imparted the recipe .
 if his grand dad or great granddad is cixi imperial chef and his plain steam rice is so good cixi eats it breakfast lunch and dinner ,  can consider 1 million but some hawker recipe for 1million ?
 ok if its that fried hokkien prawn mee hawker selling for few hundred thousand ,  can consider .
 cos his take home is few thousand or 10000 a month
 $100k-$200k if the stall is popular maybe still acceptable .
 asking for $1million is like 2rm hdb asking for $1million .
 ultimately its risky .
 even for a hawker who easily takes in 5000 to 10000 a month , there &apos;s no guarantee if he teaches chiu ,  chiu can reach his same standard and get the long queues he have .
 so many big mouth sinkies complain even the son cant cook as well as father and grandfather etc .
 yup ,  they not looking for successors ,  more to looking for windfall…
 100k moi oso dont wan .
 treat the public as gong kias .
 so easy to bluff meh
 if their food is good .
 they would have enuf for retirement oredi .
 the food must sucks
 haha you &apos;re so mean
 wan to have a last dig of the pie ah ?
 chiu really treat us like suckers ah ?
 never eat ngoh hiong people wont die .
 u really think  &apos;young people useless ,  wont wan to ownself learn how to cook ngoh hiong ah ?
 i goto your stall eat your ngoh hiong once ,  spend $3 to learn your recipe at least 75% is good enuff for me liao .
 is cos of the whole unesco nonsense and so many hundred thousand votes that get u the status and now make u like  &apos;protected species &apos; .
 sure ,  200 , 000 per person to retire is not alot .
 but 1 person to come out with 1m is alot .
 it &apos;s rather bs .
 reminds me of the hamburger kitchen nightmare episode .
 the restaurant owner thought use wagyu meat = good burger .
 end up his burger kenasai ,  lose to his chef who just use normal patty meat and season properly .
 i see her before irl .
 she damn short and petite .
 flat all the way  
 what a good and blessed life  .
 padding for ig photos gaogao .
 i saw her youtube video ,  she open mouth i close the video liao  
 quick all innow  .
 i print my own  .
 pay my self 700 million oso can
 moi think will be like groupon .
 find a few people to make them rich and create news…more people follow… then crash .
 simps deserved to be ripped 
 whois irene zhao ?
 5mil easily in the pocket .
 money really come easy to those who look good .
 pretty face can liao
 i want to change sex !
 when i was young and got to know lousy strokes and ugly faces in traditional art scene can fetch obscene prices ,  i thought why so many siao langs .
 now nfts brought it to the next level ,  101 permutations of ugly monkeys ,  minecraft pixels ,  weird animals .
 are fetching obscene prices .
 humanity has evolved indeed .
 actually make nfts liao ,  upload need to pay any fees ?
 for $1k u can find a top quality local fl and fark her poosie out .
 top up a bit and she will let u take any pics u want of her boobs & abalone .
 but now this simps pay > $10k for a pic that is widely avail on internet .
 like just a pic which u cannot touch or use .
 her ig profile got so many free pics of hers ,  still not enough for pcc use ?
 these simps really dont die oso useless .
 can easily withdraw as cash ?
 or stuck as nft/crypto ?
 like tio toto first prize .
 anyway just right click save picture as can liao what those people that buy kum gong or what   
 nfts sound like the perfect vehicle to launder money .
 this is why crypto is going to implode haha
 this is blashemy .
 this is madness .
 this is simp-sis .
 simi sai variant come singapore oso scared of tt and se .
 virus mutates all the time la .
 just see whether the mutation affect the virus and how it affect us in any significant way .
 like throwing dice .
 but anyway guess what .
 pap confirm gonna be reactionary again (aka slow to act ,  last to act .
 die liao then act) .
 pap of the past (gct era and prior) will see it before it happens and take preemptive actions .
 pap now is like zzzzzzzzzz
 waiting for ceca variant 
 #fakenews : prob spread through despacito .
 if their famous favela kena = big nuke on overpop ,  bg style
 miw have tt token .
 open doors wide wide nw ,  everyone go bk office please .
 works like thai amulet !
 oni dont have cheena variant 
 sfa will be busy checking the food imports liao .
 this one will come to us very quickly .
 country and culture names cannot be linked to a virus
 thought yahoo news say got 50 double mutant from india .
 maybe next time we can have our singapore variant too .
 we are the hub of everything 
 got brasil ,  uk ,  sa ,  ceca triple mutants but no wuhan ,  who is a bunch of racist .
 we not xeno one .
 which mutant want can come over visit no problem 
 i think your main issue is thinking that going another company means starting your career progression again from scratch .
 i dont think thats generally how it works ,  at least not from the salary perspective .
 yr boss is the person paying the salarys or just another highly paid employee title manager
 i always looking for new opportunities .
 then measure is that worth to go or not .
 either thinking is that worth to stay put .
 chiu may not like what i going to say .
 i think your top management may not have any plans for chiu if chiu are not in their network and they are not making chiu inclusive .
 unless the employee is in their network ,  the other workers are just nobody to them .
 if chiu suddenly ask them this question ,  they will most probably tell chiu to check with your immediate boss about your career progression .
 (dun assume the top management know the hard work that chiu put in ,  most of the time ,  they dont give a fark about it .
 pardon me for saying this .
 was this naive in the past .
 the hard truth is the company dont have any individual career progression plan for all the employee unless the guy is oredi spearhead to be the management in the future .
 the guy is most likely some one who is a scholar or with some strong connection and backing .
 see it in my ex company where some one was riding a rocket up the ladder even though he did not really achieved much in the initial job .
 the individual career progression for individual staff is snake oil sold to all the naive graduates when they are still in school .
 using army terms .
 moi ask moi co ,  not oc ,  moi co ask moi bridgade commander ,  bridgade commander say ok to let me take masters as long as i dont jump to other units within the organization .
 i duno how it will pan out for u if u skip your  (co) ,  some people dont like people to skip chain of command
 self interest comes first ,  company second .
 work for yourself ,  not for the company .
 it &apos;s more of having to adapt to new place ,  new people and prove my worth all over again if i go to another place .
 ask my direct boss he will continue to give me the ai mai ai mai answer .
 i did ask him earlier this yr and he cant give me an answer so i think if i ask him again ,  it will be the same .
 no worries bro .
 i think deep down i know the answer oredi .
 thanks for all the good advice here 
 yr direct boss oso employee ah .
 then totally pointless to ask cos hr oso dunno where he is going in his progression
 can see that chiu are oredi enlightened liao .
 pardon me for being naggy .
 just scared that chiu may not see the light and die die want to know your worth in the company .
 your worth is what chiu give yourself and how much chiu earn at the end of the month .
 no need to seek externally for recognition and confirmation .
 at the end of the day ,  we are all just corporate slave in the modern times .
 as some of the guys highlighted ,  moving to a new company may exposed chiu to new challenges and work projects but chiu will be still stuck with the same predicament unless some top management decide to groom chiu to be his henchmen .
 seem like your boss is making use of chiu for his career .
 bro hello again .
 im the guy oso looking out .
 i had the same mentality thinking i need to to new place and prove myself .
 but recently i realize it doesnt matter why work so hard ,  the hard work u put it like what others say ,  the management doesnt give a fuck .
 i came to this realization thinking back abt my current place .
 people who do nothing can oso be seen as wayyy better just cos they got strong backing
 yes ,  this is what i have observed too .
 thats why i think when i go to the new place ,  i will network more and oni put my skill to good use once i find a strong backer .
 otherwise just do bare minimum then go home .
 if it &apos;s so drastic that chiu are considering a career switch ,  then chiu probably got to leave .
 it’s game over for chiu in your current company le 
 can ,  ts can request to join in morning management meetings for a start 
 they will just patronise chiu without any committed reply cos chiu are not their direct report 
 most singapore companies even global mncs are like this 
 then chiu want to stay in this company until retirement ?
 added new terms and a poll : .
 : lan lan suck thumb = nothing can be done ,  just accept it
 what is lol with an x behind ?
 cim means come in mouth ba .
 not come in me .
 sticky sticky worx
 now everyone will understand our secret talk
 what about robert ?
 whats the story behind that .
 like when some guy complain he do alot for a girl but macham not appreciated .
 i see before alot of times but dont understand leh .
 nice thread for the noobs .
 thx ts for the great effort  !
 make this a sticky ok .
 y some people like to say omgwtfbbq  ?
 wat &apos;s that bbq for  ?
 maybe ryonee can explain ?
 his avatar picture is  &apos;omg wtf bbq &apos; .
 nsfw = not safe (suitable) for weak .
 (must check this type of thread out !
 anyway appreciate your hardwork  .
 benefit to newbie like me .
 mod or admin should consider to put this under sticky thread ?
 took quite awhile to get use to it =))
 if got oman how come no tentacle rape .
 fugly = fukking ugly
 for moi we have 4 boy 11 girls .
 my office havent engage child labor .
 my office got no bois and gurls 
 all grow up already
 lao uncle lao auntie many la .
 what girl and boy .
 got skillsfuture and sgunited traineeship .
 we need to upgrade ourselves so we can compete with foreigners for the good jobs .
 they can make into like a big mistake but that is to frighten chiu .
 company cant be seen to nitpick .
 wrongful dismissal for minor mistake .
 liddat many will be terminated liao .
 usually cant terminate on trivial mistakes unless u lose millions in investments .
 if your reporting manager telling chiu this .
 it means he oso hinting chiu to leave
 mnc can do such things too ,  depends on the boss
 this is the age where getting another job is quite challenging .
 try internally got any lobang if your company is big enough .
 but ntuc will help us yes ?
 cb boss told upline that i never do my work .
 client heard and scolded my boss and the upline .
 as a result ,  i ownself tender .
 if hand over not done properly ,  what can happen .
 nor for my grandfather &apos;s grave at bu lim mountain .
 still ,  kena exhumed becasue the land was to be redeveloped .
 leasehold or not ,  there is no escape !
 no wonder people die die wanna buy fh condo .
 no fh for graves .
 at most few decades .
 wonder why lay inside in first place .
 one final upz for those who missed it
 no point to burial in sinkieland .
 just burn away better
 no ,  muslim grave is free hold
 i think this is how in asian culture ,  arsenic slowly seeps into the ground and keeps recycling back into our rice  
 dont click if u easily scared .
 walan why youtube allow uncensored ?
 seems like its better to be cremated .
 too much trouble to exhume after such a long time .
 alot of uncertain  .
 see bidari oso exhumed  .
 your uncle died very young ?
 i like this pic .
 the mummy still seems to have life with that exposed grin .
 my late grandma died over 25 years buried in lck and oni recently exhumed .
 lck land is damn bad .
 water pool and she was submerged .
 not probably decomposed too .
 or maybe by the vivid imagination of mankind to spread from a tiagong into legends and stories .
 full of respect to the worker .
 cos  &apos;last wishes &apos; .
 some people just cant get past the fact what &apos;s gonna happen to their bodies when they die .
 my boss must watch this .
 he cant bring his money and investment properties to his grave when he uplorry so stop squeezing us dry .
 hardly anyone would do this but rachatitipong did it
 the emphasis of responsibility has now shifted away from the helpdesk and towards the individual
 covid spread in the network
 ownself check ownself pc kym ?
 yeah ,  ticketing portal to track what they perform .
 stupid old uncle .
 thats why i prefer ceca it helpdesk ,  can fck them .
 old uncle fck him he more cb .
 any user ptoblrm usually will remote in to their laptop to troubleshoot .
 end up the quote from the vendor more expensive than hiring in-house .
 they can claim ot .
 of cos ownself check ,  it helpdesk alredi pre-empt and gib all end users free screwdrivers
 the company has ghosted
 like sunshine empire
 cos people on the ground see things clearer then those paper skolars n generals in ivory towers
 your it boss is kenneth ?
 at least got real human manning lines ?
 i hate them ai bots boliao auto ten year series answers never helpful grrrr .
 i was in this not simpur thread .
 in the meantime at your ceca it procrastination helpdesk .
 aiya it helpdesk scared later ceo wife come jjyy their response .
 so they diam diam la .
 your boss will tell u got no time to sexplain .
 rly damn jialat .
 it dept overwhelmed
 the problem is the software rna got outdated malware database ,  cannot handle the new version d .
 problem is ownself check ownself  .
 how to know ownself got omicron or nt  ?
 if  i ownself check ownself on art   +ve   == stay home at 10 days .
 ownself clear ownself == even art still +ve still can go out .
 miss ong the brain tio electric shock again isit .
 history will repeat again
 if the sick person doesnt experience alot or severe symptoms .
 unless too sick must go see doctor do test then know is omicron what .
 so they oni start from quarantine .
 no one knows if any of those art is actually omicron variant since no pcr test .
 if they can survive at home unknowingly then maybe next news we read is ,  it’s not as deadly but taking precautions  .
 anyway better be caution than sorry
 ownself clear ownself hw to know
 this country really is in deep shyt .
 and they still think that they are the best .
 miss ong xiu toh liao
 ownself clear ownself is the highest level
 wonder how they gona identify omicron when art usage doesnt test specifically on omicron .
 been asking people to self isolate upon art positive but now say no hr for omicron .
 how are they going to pick out omicron from the population ?
 oni pcr can do that .
 plus ,  the art test for which antigen of the virus ?
 if omicron mutated these antigen ,  art might not work ?
 ownself check ownself then proceed to clear ownself .
 this is e highest level which no virus and disease can beat
 is a feature not a bug .
 how else to keep case lumber low so can open more vtl
 the worst are those close contacts need to be quarantined at those dedicated facilities instead of at home
 how u know which strain u got ?
 chiu still test ?
 no test = no case
 dont test and save money .
 no need to buy art kit .
 no test = no case .
 the recover from home thingy is just bs .
 cos gahment is paying for lodging ,  its the cheapest to recover at home .
 they ran out of chalet and hotel are for traveler who pay their own .
 ownself check ownself
 i follow recipe from noobcook or rasa malaysia oso better than these hawkers
 $1 mil price tag .
 must come with guarantee long queue .
 assuming a generous 15k per month profit ,  it would take the hawker 6 years to break even ?
 can sell for 1m means their earnings should be very gaogao .
 iras take note .
 sounds exactly like a typical sinkie worker .
 when working ,  dont want to document process or teach others in case get replaced .
 resigning time ,  dont want to document process or teach others cos not their problem ,  not getting paid extra .
 all the greedy buggers .
 typical sinkie small time business mentality  .
 many things left open .
 dont be surprised if a hawker teaches apprentice and apprentice puts on signboard the hawkers &apos; stall name when he &apos;s got no permission to do so
 very tough for  &apos; normal  &apos; hawker not selling expensive things like seafood
 ate before ,  taste normal oni .
 this kind of easy to learn common mixed fried food want to sell 1 million ?
 in before hawker no cpf
 ate before his wu xiang .
  ,  taste normal oni and his stall no queue one cos he sell very ex .
 this kind of normal lanj receipe he still dare to sell for 1 million .
 this is what i fear about the cb and has .
  our food is part of our culture ,  identity and happiness .
  oredi the soft side of life in singapore is neglected where $ and economy is the focus .
 thats why it didnt make sense even if applied a generous estimation .
 oni companies who can franchise it out would consider it
 $1m is too much
 i dont mind pay money get recipe .
 monkey worrlee is they secretly miss out 1-2 key ingredients .
 if the boss sees big potential in it ,  open tons of shops selling it & get 30 workers doing it in factory or mechanized it .
 of course must have a demand for it nationwide
 u dont earn that much as a hawker couple with the fact that it is a tiring job with barely any days off unless u r a corporation with enough money to take it to the next lvl with central kitchen .
 otherrwise one has to be really stupiak to pay for a receipe liddat .
 i want do good but chiu just pay me first…
 start your own unique food and master it…… 1 million can do a lot… .
 there is no short cut to success… .
 this hawker can just die off with their so call recipe … .
 if they really want to  &apos;preserve &apos; their heritage and need retirement money ,  just setup course la $500 per head ,  run 2 years .
 can get 1000 students per year if it is that good .
 hoping for 1 mil windfall ,  think it is toto isit
 so can still use opensea or need use another platform ?
 $10 , 000 is for a non-fungible token (nft) is a one-of-a-kind digital token that is permanently linked to a piece and is encrypted with the artist &apos;s signature .
 it validates the piece &apos;s ownership and authenticity .
 it &apos;s a form of digital asset that can be used to represent real-world artefacts like art ,  music ,  video ,  and in-game stuff .
 bro ,  top quality local fl oni $1 , 000 ?
 i will give her $1 , 000 plus $1 , 000 tips for my first try with her if she’s good .
 i dont understand this world anymore
 which useless edmwer simping for her quickly own up
 knn flat like airport i can’t even fff .
 edmwer moobs bigger than hers
 a real life analogy would be like throwing money to buy  &apos;flower &apos; for ktv girl .
 need to use a solana based marketplace .
 right now nfts are still not crosschain compatible yet .
 but solana nft less risky since its dirt cheap to create an nft there due to low gas fees ,  so even if u make and cannot sell u wont lose as much money as ethereum nfts
 icic ,  didnt know got such things behind this nfts thing
 not oni hype but 10x worse than meme stocks ,  lol .
 this lady is probably part of the 10% who made money .
 problem is ,  they dont showcase the majority 90% who lost large amounts of money and snorkeling at bedok reservoir now .
 i believe there should be some sort of mandatory tax for these .
 hope pap pwn them .
 which kumgong go buy the nft at its ballooned price
 up for awareness .
 feminists please take note .
 thish is what females want to do with their lives .
 make monies by sexualizing ownself .

 5 million dollars so far with her newly launched nfts .
 irene zhao: singapore-based influencer rakes in $7 .
 5 mil thus far with her nfts​
 by the way one thing to note ,  all of bigqing &apos;s nfts were given out for free .
 then those who got it for free put it up for sale at those insane prices and other people keep buying them .
 maybe alot of the initial minters who got them free are bigqing &apos;s friends .
 non-fungible token (nft) is a one-of-a-kind digital token that is permanently linked to a piece and is encrypted with the artist &apos;s signature .

 egg white tastes good leh
 cos u can stil eat the egg white .
 just put everything into your mouth .
 moi keep the shell ,  toss out the whites and yolk

 yesterday got robbery today got bus flip
 no need vaccine ,  free heart attack
 i will say failed design la ,  need to use reinforced concrete 3m thick instead of the green feeble fence .
 then bus wont topple down liao mah .
 all the bus ads telling people to hold on to poles and not rush etc etc ,  as if all accidents due to passengers &apos; fault but i notice some bus drivers getting more reckless .
 maybe there should be more ads and more incentives for drivers to drive more safely .
 and how come bus companies never come under scrutiny when accidents happen ?
 oni driver genna charged and not high ranking officials ?
 should have used armco barriers instead
 tomorrow that bus interchange will resume service ?
 can claim how much insurance ?
 some drivers love to jam brake .
 some passengers rushing to reincarnate and love to move towards the exit when the bus havent even reach the bus stop and force people standing to give way while the bus is still moving
 why the tire like no thread macam botak one ?
 this zb reporter tio kan by mata korkor for keep crossing over the cordoned area !
 not to stereotyow but recent bus drivers very selfishly and aggressively .
 many just filter out of bus stop without giving 2nd hoot about drivers behind .
 they are even doing this one stop without way lane .
 i always havethe courtsey to give way to them but some of them really too much
 they employed what the 61% voted for .
 more fark ups coming
 that spot has been on railings for as long as i can remember .
 fillip ing massa did it in f1
 so the bugs are resolved ?
 no more worries of 737max doing a sudden nosedive ?
 u trust the americans  ?
 alot of ib like to say if edmwer so kiang they should go and do the govt &apos;s work .
 in the end alot of things that the mtf implement were oredi brought up on edmw donkey times liao ,  or the change in situation oredi predicted ahead by edmwers way before the stats were released .
 seriously cannot understand those who think people in high position must be more capable and wu liao .
 they never heard of connections or climbing up through playing politics meh ?
 and they expect those who have political aspirations not to play politics on the way up ?
 notch simpur thread sia

 nobody in the right mind would assist a claypot king .
 no blame culture .
 the hod of service desk just explain that the it incident happened so fast ,  they no time to explain .
 so user has to ownself troubleshoot ownself solve liao .
 to samurai the issue: who did the user renew contract with in last year ?
 the boss didnt do a impromptu visit to the department ?
 the whole it department including hod really cmi ,  must be no study itil v4 on service management .
 where is the guiding principle “focus on value”  ?
 just sack the whole department and let them go skill future course to retrain .
 small problem oni call it ,  knn some even show up at department when all they need is ctl+alt+del .
 the ops room oni has 100 phones and 100 staff manning it .
 there is a surge in the uptick of cases but management did not pay for more phones and staff and expect the current strength to handle the load .
 problem lies with mgt not ground staff .
 liddat who is the manyzer in charge ?
 go in the room and tell them wake up .
 do chiu think it will be sinovac ?
 knowing them they will say  &apos;i want the best &apos;
 18 yo vaccine is best

 the wiki is very neat .
 nsfw means not suitable for work ba .
 hehe ,  so honored to have your first post here .
 no offense ah ,  but are chiu a crone ?
 or mayb chiu is a silent btss always lurking in nsfw threads .
 can enlighten if there &apos;s any connection between oman and tentacle rape ?
 added 2 more : .
 : dont peek (hokkien) .
 this is usually typed by the thread starter as a blocker .
 : some text that people put at the start of their thread to prevent others from peeking at the content when chiu place your cursor over a thread .
 added some more :  .
 lols/lolx/lolz : meaningless variant of lol (see lol) .
 : pei du mah ma (chinese) = a mother who accompanies her overseas studying child .
 typically refers to people from cheena .
 : por lan pa (hokkien) = carry balls = to butter up ,  to brown-nose
 comfirm not crone ,  start ssrr edmw 3 mths ago .
 alway want to start 1 thread like this .
 help newbird to blend in but not blur in .
 ps: photo here not pt enuf la 
 u must be too free
 can include milf ?
 but but but milf is not unique to edmw wor .
 as requested and added a quite a few more : .
 : f**king ugly = extremely ugly .
 : mother i &apos;d like to f**k (generally refers to older women who are sexually attractive) .
 : not safe for work .
 usually used to indicate that the content of the thread is not safe to view during work (eg .
 : photoshop (usually used to mean that a picture is doctored) .
 : sammy boy forum .
 : tan ku ku (hokkien for wait long long) = something that chiu say in order to tell someone that an event is not likely to happen = dont hold your breath .
 this has since become a list of terms used in edmw .
 and not necessary unique to edmw .
 ermz ,  sorry ,  but not very sure what u r trying to put through .
 the thread u gave is about this guy who self-pwn cos of a pic he posted right ?
 the pic shows some  &apos;naughty &apos; folder names like tentacle rape .
 from wiki ,  this is the meaning of tentacle rape .
 as for barrel roll ,  this is explained in wiki too .
 maybe there &apos;s another meaning in edmw ?
 if chiu believe in metaverse ,  that’s the first thing chiu need
 it &apos;s not the simps .
 it &apos;s just the big fishes cooking up the pot .
 zero cost or neligible cost to them .
 offload slowly from the top  .
 till it tank to the bottom .
 every single decline is oso profit for them .
 cos they oredi have a large amount of the tokens at very very very very cheap cost ,  nearly neligible cost in today &apos;s prices
 society has gone down the drain .
 women so easily just selling their pics online and making millions .
 luckily the simps not like chiu which is oso a minority in .
 simps make her a millionaire  .
 bet they damm proud of that .
 had a friend who was involved in icos last time .
 he said his project had to pay market makers to create impression of volume so people would buy into the project .
 i wouldnt be surprised if this nft oso did the same (or worse ,  buy and sell using wallets they control) just to entice people to join the hype train and offload to them .
 after all ,  everything is anonymous .
 might as well say fap to prawnhub for free .
 sinkies are gullible people .
 ownself buy own nft
 nft the new ponzi scam .
 oni morons will buy at this point  .
 wow instant millionaire
 at least she made it  .
 then the rest sure  .
 manmy cash rich people out there
 if really can make so much money ,  she will leak out the golden geese ?
 simponomics and people in crypto is flush with capital and oso got alot of apes
 she got cash out ?
 crypto dropped so much past few days .
 yeah amazing can make 7 over millions
 do nfts in cheena ?
 no way   at least not for now .
 cos i have andy lau face .
 i will look at other countries &apos; people .
 if people at cheena ,  united states and australia stop wearing mask (unless they are sick ,  and they wear mask to prevent spreading their illness to other people) ,  .
 and if the singapore gahment announce no need wear mask unless we are sick ,  .
 then i will oso follow suit and oso stop wearing mask ,  and oni wear mask if i am sick .
 i follow what my company says .
 after all it is the one paying my salary .
 which coincidentally is not alot so i oso have the choice to fuck off if things dont agree .
 cos i bought alot 
 yes cos flu is oso sibei disgusting
  cos can give bui bui face from wfh .
 will contd to wear .
 i oso notice i fall sick less often
 continue to wear for at least 6 mths first then see how
 have chiu seen the way some of these people behave ?
 removing masks to spit ,  sneeze ,  cough .
 exposing their nostrils etc or wearing masks on their chins .
 i dont want to catch anything from these people .
 i started wearing mask in public transport and shopping mall before  &apos;healthy people no need to wear mask &apos; .
 i too yandao liao .
 will wear eye mask instead
 why chiu need to see others ?
 definitely not is this tropical climate
 yes i will continue wearing forever
 i have not been wearing mask for my run for the past one year .
 no problem one .
 im quite sad chiu got such colleagues .
 or maybe im too lucky lol ,  cos so far ,  i &apos;ve oni encountered one excolleague who is south asian ,  exactly like what chiu described .
 but thats just 1 .
 unless he can cook some fish head claypot thats to die for or some durian puff or durian cake thats fabulous
 we are now talking about hawker stalls .
 but even kopitiam type of still oso a big risk for the buyer/investor .
 anyone remember kay lee roast ?
 lol sold for 4 million and laughing to the bank .
 obviously a big boss investing 1 million must think big .
 he wont be investing 1 million and rolling his ngoh hiang .
 that will never recoup his 1 million  .
 and i thought the 4 million at least included a property
 the person buying it must be cursing and swearing his worst decision made ever… .
 4 million spend to make himself poorer and have to work his whole life to recoup the money… .
 i think of hawker read this thread he &apos;ll be very upset .
 he &apos;s just looking for his retirement fund .
 edmw ers not buying at 1 million can just keep quiet
 cna writer needs to go for writing class .
 putting up for sale at an exorbitant price of $1m =  &apos;hope for successor &apos; ?
 change the title to  &apos;hope for windfall &apos; !
 normally these hawkers will say will take months to teach chiu .
 if you &apos;re a dodo chef then you &apos;ll be making hawker earn his 1 million with blood sweat & tears
 typical singapore media crap .
 whatever shite fed to them ,  just write and let readers form conclusions  .
 at least wont be sued doing this way
 siaolang pay 1m to start working as a hawker .
 oni carrot head will buy la .
 their food oso not very nice .
 it &apos;s a ridiculous offer .
 even eduardo saverin or forrest li wont buy it .
 his ngohhiang they keep advert cos they say this one is handmade  .
 so chiu buy his recipe is to do handmade .
 cannot industrialize else your signboard useless .
 dont seem feasible for 1million  .
 maybe at 200k whereby the new owner can recoup in 2 3 years is fine .
 1million is lion open big mouth
 still got kumgong this days to buy hawker &apos;s recipe with such amount of money ?
 please opened your eye ,  there are so many such failed investment &apos;s model happened before .
 i dont think it was ever about imparting the skill .
 or just a very tiny portion .
 i think 2k then fair value .
 maybe max 20k if the hawker will personally coach until chiu can cook .
 new young gen still need to pay for renovation ,  store deposit fee ,  etc etc .
 will selling this special ngoh hiang make it so much more profitable than selling other food ?
 anyone tried the dish before ?
 is it really to die for until recipe worth 1million ?
 might as well go rob
 cos he just want to farm for as long as possible 
 this is exactly huai fresh meat are preferred to  older and more sexperienced candidates during jod interview  .
 chiu employ older candidates and they got more pattern 
 but how yoh intend to get your strong backing in the new company ?
 even if chiu network ,  people may not want to entertain chiu .
 look at chee hong tart .
 he tried so hard in pap but is he successful ?
 can eat don’t waste 
 hr doesn’t stand for human rubbish for nothing 
 your advice is so true to the point .
 experienced the exact same thing my self and i laugh at myself now for being so naive in the past .
 is nt for everyone .
 sometimes people just look pass chiu .
 doesnt mean chiu cmi .
 is like being the popular kid in class .
 if nt popular is ok .
 as long salary is good .
 so if chiu see your promotion or progression dangled like a carrot to make chiu work harder ,  bt chiu dont get it year after year .
 just hop for the increment .
 after a few increment chiu will fuck care the promotion .
 cos money talks .
 the next thing chiu know .
 1 of the new jobs will offer chiu title jump oso .
 it comes when chiu dont want it .
 no one entertains then i just do bare min and go home lor .
 at least i wont feel like i am doing too much for nothing
 do what is expected lor/ what they pay chiu to do .
 then use extra time pick up new certifications or skillsets hopefully more new opportunities will come .
 if the annual increment is reasonable and chiu are ok with the job scope ,  can stay put .
 same experience for me .
 my former company keeps promoting people based on favouritism .
 whoever is under the person the big boss likes gets promotion very easily .
 usually ,  need 5 to 6 years for one promotion .
 many people left cos of this and the big boss still ask why people dont want to stay .
 sadly that is the toxic culture of sinkie .
 jump every 2-3 years where chiu can bring your experience onboard .
 so chiu can get decent salary increment .
 above is the golden advice to everyone .
 for myself ,  the biggest indicator that it is time to leave a company would be the time when i feel dreaded going to work .
 i will usually talk to my manager to talk about career progression in general ,  not necessarily promotion but maybe change in scope .
 for my last job ,  i came to know my job title has little meaning to it .
 95% of the time i am doing  &apos;garbage collection &apos; for the more senior staff .
 talked to my manager who went bs-ing me for 1 hour and had no plans to groom me for anything .
 when i finally had enough and decided to leave ,  my former manager asked me why i wanted to leave .
 i just told him all that we talked of didnt work out and it was plain as day that he had (or acted) forgotten what we had discussed .
 so the conversation ended there and then .
 haha of cos not .
 will make plans to leave soon
 looks like this is the norm .
 sounds like my situation !
 when i talked to my boss earlier this year and mid last year ,  oso go round and round for an hour plus .
 in the end ,  the oni conclusion drawn is he couldnt promise anything and can oni ask me to wait .
 u know when i work in one big insurance company my manager he always give promotion to his particular race even they are new comer until one of the old uncle so fed up that he went to the director and complaint and my horrible manager been called by the director and that uncle get promoted and since then he never get anymore promotion .
 it was reallldy depressing i work so hard everyday start from 9am and end at 10pm sometime 11pm for 10 years no promotion and my increament is around $25 .
 while other particular races they dont have to work so hard at 5pm everyday go home and they can get promotion every 2 years even new comer can get it and advance his career .
 that is why base on my own personal working experienced working in singapore i prefer to work with foreigners at least to me they are fair .
 bro in singapore it is liddat if everything goes well he get the credit if things dosent goes well his fingers will point at u .
 in singapore it all about connection if one are related or manager pet  his carrer oredi there .
 if we just a nobody even we work like a dog we get no where .
 sadly this is the culture in singapore
 ask yr customers to open a telegram self help group 
 my it department shoot new ail liao .
 all computers infected with virus ,  user just need to shut now and let anti virus do its scanning .
 when chiu re-start up a few days later they said the virus will be cleanse woh !
 anti virus and letting computers cool down can be so powerful 
 it team got tell chiu have no time to explain .
 virus now become tricker to detect and harder to trace .
 if that is the case ,  then your it team is beh .
 gan ,  time to replace the entire team .

 wonder hao the bus can drove off the edge and drop to lower level .
  if not speeding would have thought the fence can block the fall .
 wa this is quite serious sia .
 the bus driver hoseh liao la
 how tf it happened siol
 policeman so fierce .
 usually i seen them is send 5 pos to catch and bring down one guy 
 i did tell chiu previously that malaysian truck ,  bus and van drivers have a history of drug abuse .
 especially drugs that permanently damage the brain .
 that is why some bus/truck drivers commit strange accidents that defy analysis .
 long ago there was a sbs bus that slammed into others from a stationery position at traffic junction just before bukit merah interchange .
 it was as though the driver for 30 seconds completely lost his mind .
 well ,  like in this bukit batok bus terminus case .
 when faced with indians he sure run like the wind
 sibkies easy to bully .
 typical bully the weak and fear the strong .
 if is angmo he sure bow down 45 angle politely ask he to move back .
 dont expect too high standard from 158th media .
 where got people design bus interchange liddat de
 local policemen oni dare to threaten commoners .
 their balls shrank in places like little india .
 dont expect too high standard from *160th media*
 that abang mata just being damn cb la ,  either that or he just gotch tio gan by his upper rank senior/superior for notch doing his job of dispersing kaypoh onlookers properly  .

 she just doing her job  .
 zaobao shud publish that abang mata screenshot who gan her on camera  .
 now chiu all now why our papers are never on  &apos;friendly &apos; terms with our mata  .
 its always these kind of cb matas who always try to prevent the reporters from reporting the  &apos;truth &apos;  .
 they &apos;ve learnt well from their miw masters ,  always try to keep things  &apos;secret &apos; from us  .
 oni want us to hear/see  &apos;nice &apos; things  .
 fwhaaa fwhat happen
 anchorman style fight at gardens by the bay ?
 reminded me of the us and nk summit held here few year ago .
 hmm so are singapore using tax payers monies again to host the events ?
 it might be a success helding here since singapore are friend and allies for both country
 might as well say singapore is a whore who happily take it in the mouth ,  vag ,  and butt for us ,  cheena ,  and ceca respectively and at the same time
 very expensive peek   .
 how much are we gonna overspend this time ?
 lack of experience excuse again ?
 so this will be where biden sell us to winnie .
 welcome to singapore .

 his name was used very often ,  even outside of the trio .
 wa very useful xdd
 maybee ts is do it 4 chiu wor 
 upz upz ,  this is a great thread !
 i dunno got such topic one .
 but when i came here ,  i just guess guess roughly can understand :x
 how come dont have the meaning of .
 i been looking for that
 techno is either short for technology or more commonly refers to the electronic dance music genre .
 is there a special meaning behind ?
 if yes ,  maybe chiu can supply an example of how it was used .
 u should change your name to clevergal zeh zeh    .
 when i 1st came here ,  so confused by the sic ,  pruss wan ,  oman ,  wols .
 got tua tua liap .
 6% refer to the number of percentage of people that support our party last election .
 tua tua liap = big big one (reference to breast)
 oh so is link to pap ?
 ask the pros here .
 i am oso one of those that just stick around .
 sooner or later chiu will get it .
 like syt is sweet young thing .
 if i am not wrong ,  66 .
 6% is used to refer to the people who voted for pap .
 not sure if this percentage gets the attention cos of the number connection to the devil .
 6% ,  are chiu happy now that chiu have to pay extra 2% gst ?
 what abt im thread ?
 ---> instant messaging .
 u missed nbnbnlm (no bobbies no beauty nobody love me)
 what is  &apos;zeh zeh &apos; ?
 mainly westerners buying her stuff .
 although i respect your opinion ,  your view is very narrow leh .
 i totally dunno how she make money .
 i really wonder why these people earn so much but yet those brick and mortar career like construction that builds infrastructure earn so little .
 i should rally a drive asking all construction members ,  people ,  workers etc to work slowly and let &apos;s see how it impacts the economy cycle .
 people onlyfans $55 per week for access but this is $10 , 000 for the nfts as access pass wtf !
 this forum always have poor people trying to teach rich people how they should manage their money .
 very kind that they hope the rich wont end up like them .
 the irenedao collection is listed on opensea ,  and consists of 1 , 107 items .
 currently ,  the cheapest nft ,   &apos;have fun staying poor &apos; ,  is priced at 0 .
 94 ethereum ,  which is worth approximately s$3 , 000 .
 the entire collection has a total trade volume of 2 , 300 ethereum ,  equivalent to at least s$7 .
 creating nft and then buying it yourself is a way of laundering money .
 who knows if someone is merely using her as a front and giving her a bit of cut to justify it .
 some more ,  look how poor quality her photoshopped pics are… it’s almost like she doesn’t care if it sells or not ,  cos she doesn’t have to
 yes ,  cannot sustain and will crash eventually like ponzi
 selling mmyself now !
 that kind  of  &apos;work &apos; can be that profitable ?
 & that part  &apos;have fun staying poor &apos; ?
 these kind of nfts (whatever they are) .
 could be due to money laundering la .
 5million dollars worth of pictures ?
 how much she get a cut from the sale ?
 5 million is oni the value of pictures that is put up for sale ?
 so many think with k k j .
 what’s the incentive to work hard nowadays ?
 feels like there’s always such news of people who do nothing (of value) and earn big bucks .
 people who create real things and actually add value to this world not making any money .
 what’s the point anymore  ?
 indeed ,  must try to have godfather/mother in the workplace then got chance .
 work hard no use must work smart .
 need to be good at job first and then network for sponsors .
 when u know it  ,  u will know it
 companies will think chiu are in your comfort zone enough not to jump .
 so no incentives to promote chiu .
 go look for your competitors companies for opening .
 this is a sad fact of life .
 promotion and so called progression are dependent on your sponsors and how well your boss like u .
 not so much on your capabilities as long as u still can get work done .
 i saw this thread a few weeks back
 write down your pull and push factors .
 then make your decision .
 i just got a new jod .
 started from scratch .
 but bigger coy and looks better on my resume if i want to jump ship again .
 previous job i had few projects going but promotion was never in sight .
 boss even personally said sorry for me but for what ?
 want to go just go and don’t look back .
 but how u know whether is your backer got power ?
 and how u know who is who assuming u r new ?
 wont u worried u por the wrong person ,  like enemy of your direct boss unknowingly ?
 i would suggest lie low for a few months first when u join ,  know who is in power and which people to avoid ,  then anyhow find backing
 sound like my old company .
 unwritten rules: 7 year to be promoted for everyone .
 one boss of a 5 .
 6 million employee company cry and say sorry but then after board of directors elections still nothing changes .
 u must see what kind of person those management people r .
 if those management like to play golf - u oso must learn to play golf to socialise with them .
 if those management like to play woman in ktv - u oso must learn to play woman in ktv to socialise with them .
 this is what need to be done to break into the inner circle or get a  &apos;backing &apos; .
 if not ,  why would they specially groom u or give u some career path ?
 if coy not making profit from projects then understandable .
 if coy is making huge profit ,  then should give pay increase
 what happened if chiu hit the ceiling  ,  that’s why no increment  ?
 then the bonus must be good lor ,  must be at least 3months excluding aws
 i can understand ts concern as i having the same issue as well .
 i thinking of the same thing as well .
 inside the same company for 16 years and gotten 2 promotion in the first 5 years .
 stagnant at the same mid level for the past 11 years .
 made the same mistake of not networking too .
 decided to transfer branch and ended up worse then before .
 new director doesnt have good impression of me and i am lobo to the point that during performance ranking i was ranked very poorly .
 no important tasks was assigned and everyone else is assigned crucial task .
 ask for transfer again but seems like no other division is willing to accept me .
 in the end ,  have to leave the current company .
 when your boss isnt consistently thinking new ways (more saikang for u ,  boss takes credit) to change things for the worse just to impress the bigger bosses .
 me same as u ,  i wan to move to a new coy for a manyerial position but all need to have manyzer experience .
 problem is not i dont have manyzeria experience ,  compnay oni have 6 pac and oredi have a boss and a manyzer .
 the manyzer dunno anything he get to the rank cause he is the oldest in term of age .
 he join longer then me yet dunno how the company work .
 i am basically 2nd after the boss ,  yet me is a normal executive .
 i need to teach he when he was farking promoted .
 during cb my other colleague oso wondering if he got work anot .
 i wan to recognise him as my manyzer but he too useless .
 sounds a bit like my boss .
 whenever i done well .
 he will always say that he provided input and how well he has guided me etc etc .
 yes cos a majority of people in singapore are dirty .
 follow what ahgong say lor
 throwing away stockpile of masks now !
 i got stock up to 10 boxes .
 i will continue to use it when i am on the bus or mrt ,  wouldnt want to get infected with flu ,  cough ,  etc
 now i feel nekkid outsai without mask  
 yes no need to shave and brush teeth !
 think most people will just like japan ,  90% of people simply look better with masks .
 even if u tell me to lup plastic bag i oso dont mind if nobody stare at me like freak
 will definitely wear if i’m taking public transport or in crowded places .
 no covid oso got other germs and virus .
 especially the elderly who just cough or sneeze or spit without covering their noses or mouth ,  damn disgusting .
 oni in crowded places .
 easier to crossdress
 once i take off my mask i will tio harassed by tons of ols asking for my number .
 yes ,  especially  in confined spaces where its crowded .
 law allow doesnt mean inconsiderate unhygienic people oso disappeared .
 wear mask got its good one chiu know  ?
 girls no need make up scare guy see their ugly face .
 can save money for buy make up .
 actually before covid ,  twmm oso .
 to always wear mask .
 i will stop wearing mask .
 i will stop wearing mask if gahment allow .
 wear mask too long will more pimples
 taiwan got air pollution issue ,  so alot of their citizen got habit to wear mask last time
 i’ll continue wearing mask cos can continue hiding my resting bi@tch face sibei dulan look under the mask .
 go buy beancurd skin ,  buy meat ,  prawn ,  water chestnuts ,  .
 ownself tok the meats until super fine then wrap in beancurd skin and fry it .
 cooking is what chiu yourself make out of it .
 invest 1 million in a great us stock like nvidia and chiu get 2 million back in a couple of years by doing nothing .
  typical greedy sinkie small time businessman
 noone will pay for this kind after aztech invested in kay lee and lost big 
 i got no issue for him to try to sell for 1mil .
 like he said 1mil for 5 pax ,  is oni 200k ,  nit much really .
 but he want to frame it as preserving a dying trade ,  heritage and all that .
 1 million in pocket more impt .
 young people still got buy those meh
 they probably doing it all along lor .
 and how many hawkers really submit real figures .
 the irony is whoever willing to fork out that type of money will most prob not be running it themselves or hawker style .
 likely franchise and milk it hawker chan style .
 the young these days are more educated enough to be a farmer in cs or sign on .
 how many can actually tahan the long hours of preparation to selling ?
 and being young means they are unlike to afford to buy the recipe as well .
 it appeals more to the older generation towkays who might want to make a business out of such tradtional recipe and keep the eating culture going .
 if the recipe was so good they should have earned enough to live comfortably off cpf life payouts ?
 y they need this money to  &apos;retire &apos; ?
 can add  &apos;kum gong &apos; in front of successors 
 sell oredi nothing to stop the seller from setting up another stall again right ?
 no intellectual property or sole ownership isnt it ?
 imagine realised 1 million not enough to retire and decides come out of retirement to set up stall opposite chiu and claim he is the  &apos;original &apos; ngoh hiang oso llst .
 ageing but greedy hawkers .
 wa need to sell how many noh hiang to earn back the 1million dollars sia .
 so many noh hiang receipt for free online .
 who would pay 1 million to learn from him .
 want fast money maybe
 if you’re spending a million dollars to take over a hawker business chiu need to have your head examined .
 it takes more than a recipe .
 years ago ,  there was a $25 crab meat fried rice restaurant that made the news when a minister commented on it .
  i ate there a few times and there was always a long queue during lunch time .
  the fried rice was cooked by two old sisters .
  after they retired and went back to cheena ,  the restaurant became deserted .
  i ate there again once and the standard was definitely not there .
 more lingo added : .
 : climb bukit timah hill (see bukit timah) .
 : instant messaging thread .
 a thread whose topic involves/targets the thread starter and another person oni .
 this is usually frown on and is recommended that pm (private messages) or im （eg .
 msn) be used instead .
 : no boobies no beauty nobody love me (usually used by females) .
 : no mp3 no talk (see npnt) .
 : no wma no talk (see npnt) .
 : spoof thread .
 a thread that imitates another to make fun of the thread starter or topic .
 : sweet young thing
 now i learn something .
 wa very infomative haha
 the old birds here can use some really cryptic lingo .
 always find this when someone wanna sell his/her stuff .
 bnp = buy now price
 hey ,  anyone still remember the tentacle lape ?

 ajzm = ai jiat zua mai  ?

 hehe ,  u must be one hell of a snake !
 haha this is real useful man
 haha ,  thats the purpose for starting this thread .
 edmwish is so confusing when chiu first encounter it .
 quite a few weeks never update the list .
 i think there are somemore new terms .
 maybe u can put tentacle lape ,  permanent ejaculations same with oman
 haha ,  the 2 other  &apos;popular &apos; threads in edmw  .
 wonder if anything creative will come out from our very own  &apos;mrt otoko &apos; .
 jin long never go there buy shirt and pants liao ,  tiagong now got sale going on

 robinsons online department store .
 good luck to those kum gongs .
 pretty obvious those in charge are pretty stupid .
 to even think about taking on ali ,  amazon ,  lazada ,  etc .
 who will go to their website or app (if they have .
 not that i bother wasting my time to check them out though) to make a purchase when i can get it much better and cheaper with reviews on the products before i get them online .
 and if buay song ,  i can return and get refund no question asked .
 same goes for challenger .
 i can get my stuff much cheaper than getting from them .
 the oni time i go challenger ,  courts ,  harvey norman ,  gain city ,  denki ,  etc .
 is to see the products i am going to buy online and treat them as a showroom displaying products for it &apos;s competitors online .
 can they be lol .
 all the best schooling ,  moi xdd at stake  
 chiu have the blessings of scrabby in your favour so no worry about the family jewels .
 print screen first  
 my understanding speaking with ssa personnel is  he might not even make the final .
 caeleb dressel  is the man to beat
 camping to collect kukujiao !
 why would chiu take a bet with no upside if chiu win .
 later cannot even go finals
 my understanding that chiu have zero connections whatsoever except jjww .
 but in this instance outcome is the same
 he is the king of the pool .
 schooling just lucky .
 this time hard to get any medal .
 scrabby blessed him le so its ok
 scrabby oredi jinx that he wont even get 3rd liao .
 if schooling get medal ,  i chop !
 no @scrabby no talk .
 edmw oredi has plenty of now zhong who disappeared when they are supposed to chop .
 one more chiu doesnt matter ,  one less chiu oso doesnt matter .
 bui bui confirms plus chop won’t get huan rah
 he wont even win a medal i tell u .
 dont think he will get this time round .
 dude has chilled apparently too much .
 just saw on news .
 one of the bus a cheena byd electric bus ?

 woman reporter body didnt go over police line .
 its just her leg stepped over the small drain and po is buay song with that .
 1st police line was here and ends at white metal fence .
 2nd police line (separate one) starts at the left side large wall ,  with the small drain below .
 the body of the reporter surely didnt go over police line .
 otherwise how can her camera still captured the police line in front of her ?
 this policeman behaves like idiot .
 is he buay song that she is speaking mandarin loudly to the phone ?
 or thinking she &apos;s youtuber being kaypoh doing live video ?
 just saw the live news coverage/report  .
 both buses is of the same service no .
 one ended his shift ,  one was abt to start his .
 not sure how it happened ,  unless a video leak surfaced .
 & doubt any passengers would take a video of the scenery there to catch the incident on rec mode
 can say really damn heng those smokers weren &apos;t there at their usual spot

 wa how u expose him
 but youre the truthrevealer
 no need to get agitated ,  just ignore him
 rot is too deep ,  u can oni help people who help themselves
 fb refers to this person as  &apos;her &apos;  
 likely a ceca who infiltrated edmw
 the nick sounds like a malay swear word   .
 basically he said his ns is fruitful ,  i ask which unit and vocation ,  no response .
 then in another thread i asked him how is his ns fruitful ,  he said he ate alot of fruits .
 after work then i add in the link to glgt .
 swee la such fake clones needs to be exposed
 i know this guy is a cxcx cos one edmwer calls him pukimara in sarcasm ,  n he gave a like n call him bro .
 1st 3 syllables stands for cb .
 cant help laughing myself until panjio .
 will not respond to his thread nor reply .
 to me no difference cos i am oni a peasant  
 eh ,  safety hazard la .
 when running or doing strenuous activities (eg .
 push up ,  sit up) ,  .
 do not wear mask .
 otherwise ,  chiu will get shortness of breath ,  and potentially die .
 never wear mask while running .
 got enough for years .
 will try to continue
 will continue to wear ,  if not how to finish the container of mask i managed to buy and hoard since last year .
 i even have to add in the stockpile to my will so that my children will inherit the stock even after my death .
 yes ,  probably will continue wearing .

 submarine got ping-ing system ,  can track location .
 problem if cannot surface or too deep like the kursk russian sub .
 finally now can use (to search for an actual submarine) .
 someone forgot to close the hatch ?
 or maybe they forgot that its supposed to be closed .
 surprised they have sub
 indo sea area so big how to find
 watched too much movies to imagine how bad it is if it lost buoyancy control 
 how do chiu lose a submarine ?
 one of the most technologically advanced vehicles in the world .
 always wu daji come here for help .
 never see them stand by our side .
 much to learn from brunei .
 oni aquaman can help them
 high chance chamber explosion .
 why does the situation sound so funny ,  no offence .
 hopefully everyone is safe .
 someone lost a whole commercial passenger aeroplane .
 before that lost fighter jet engines oso .
 lol lost north of bali ,  by right should ask ozland ,  papua ,  bolehland ,  east timor cos they nearer leh ,  why ask sinkieland lolol
 submarine explode still nvm ,  but explode oredi submarine oso cannot find need other countries help them find is damn fugging behkan .
 time to ban prostitution
 streaming is legal .

 simps are a disgrace
 i thought nft are suppose to be unique ?
 a quick browse of her page in opensea oredi can see so many exact duplicate photo with the exact same caption .
 just different number .
 liddat oso got simp go buy .
 moi feel moi job is pointless .
 work whole life oso cannot earn 1mil .
 this ccb spend a few weeks taking photo earn 7mil .
 time to go bedok reservoir queue up .
 that’s cos there are many people that’s willing to pay for her and support her ,  say each nfts is sold at $10 , 000 that’s 700 simps that bought into her new “product” .
 some say its money laundry .
 simps mostly come from edmw anyway 
 crypto onlym can cash out meh ?
 she stupid to put her name .
 wait cheena ban her
 i didnt get a chance to log in edmw until now .
 it takes a idiot to reply an idiot .
 let me guess ,  chiu are a male chinese ,  around 30s ,  earning no more than 6k a month .
 will not be able to afford a rcr condo ,  dont take gambles in life ,  have a gf but always quarrel ,  chiu have some friends but at the same time have difficulties in making new friends .
 average but will never amount to successful
 what &apos;s so special about her nft that make so many people willing to pay so high a price for her  ?
 the power of simps ,  making thots richer day by day
 my next life should just chop kukujiao .
 why wait till next life ?
 chop kukujiao and mint nft for it and sell and huat nao
 rets make a nft for tickets to bedok reservoir to sell
 more interested to know what is mas role in here
 diff people mah  how many of her earns so much  .
 compare means unbalance  .
 then why compare
 one thing to note is that she earned all these money in just 2 weeks .
 most people dont even earn so much in their lifetime
 very inspiring for the aspired ones .
 huat la huat la
 chiu got a pretty face and a pair of normal boobs u can oso do the same 
 why he liddat ?
 shouldn &apos;t he protect more those who unable to take vaccine since they have underlying conditions ?
 u think he got time to care so much ?
 eyes fixed on the goal then is pm material .
 cos they got  &apos;underlying conditions &apos; .
 thats the best status & no protection needed
 a problem i commonly see in workplace and this thread are .
 u all always oni change if thing is looking bad ,  if really cannot stay ,  then decide to change job .
 u guys should start look for job every 3-4 years regardless the current is comfortable or not .
 consistently keep your competitive and up to date
 we will come to a point where we must decide whether to stay put till retire or jump boat for even better prospect .
 nobody will reveal the salary .
 it i &apos;d private and confidential .
 i think current market ,  there &apos;s no such thing as worth .
 if have better opportunity ,  just go .
 the boss himself oso doesnt know what &apos;s the future of his company .
 i think it is due to fear  .
 me too ,  i resist change job ,  fear that i might not able to perform .
 last year december ,   i was retrenched .
 that force me to look for new jobs .
 the fear is enormous and frightening .
 i guess probably due to my age ,  i sm not young anymore .
 but if i give advise ,  especially those youngsters in 30s  ,  change job if golden opportunity strikes .
 sometimes chiu will be damn suay .
 chiu por the right person liao but down the road ,  he jump ship or kena asked to go .
 chiu llst liao  .
 all his enemy will target chiu alr
 if boss want to promote chiu .
 no kpi oso can promote .
 chiu make big mistakes oso can promote .
 if he dangle all this project .
 simi high profile sai .
 is all carrot .
 is to bluff idiots to stay .
 chiu move at least got money .
 money is certain .
 it &apos;s worth it when chiu realized chiu always pcw in orpit .
 no such think as loyalty .
 unlike my olden days .
 the longer chiu work .
 company will value chiu .
 chiu die your business .
 in department ,   colleague make use of one another .
 stay away from bad n evil colleague or manager .
 work as a team to be able to push on .
 just like my case ,  ceca manager ,  i tell chiu ,  life very suffering .
 network is just nicer word for  &apos;por &apos; .
 that why i dont bother to network ,  later network wrong people = landmine = die .
 what for ,  just do your job well ,  be neutral ,  unless u want the promotion so much that u like to go around  &apos;talk to bosses &apos; ,  even from other team .
 my team got one guy is liddat ,  it is up to him ,  he did the promotion he want at the end .
 but he promotion too fast until it actually make his colleague very turn off .
 i cannot say ,  on his perspective ,  he did nothing wrong on his best interest .
 is my colleague wrong ?
 on their perspective this guy really spoil the market and dont play the rule ,  they arent wrong either .
 u can be who u want to be ,  but when the time come ,  bad thing happen ,  dont come kpkb ,  cos whoever u try to  &apos;connect &apos; with ,  wont come to save u
 actually mnc is still ok .
 but this pandemic really wake up everyone .
 for me ,  not easy .
 i tried to fo my work ,   times up ,  ffuvk off  ,  get salary .
 but ceca manager make hell to me n my colleague .
 minor things oso scold chiu .
 one day i explode ,  means i make sure this ceca manager landed in hospital .
 (1) how many promotions/pay increments the last 6 years ?
 (2) has the company advertised for a more senior role than yours (e .
 senior project manager) that chiu know ought to be yours if chiu were promoted ?
 (3) in project teams ,  were chiu a team member ?
 how many times have chiu led project teams ,  whether formally or informally ?
 (4) does your boss have a boss ,  or is he the business owner ?
 if he has a boss ,  how many times was himself promoted ?
 (5) what is the overall value-add of your department ?
 which are the departments that chiu often see people getting promoted ?
 can help chiu assess if chiu can answer truthfully .
 jobs very hard to get nowadays .
 chiu stay too long oredi la .
 chiu should aim to move every 3-4 years ,  this helps to build your skills and network
 dont sit in your comfort zone too long .
 venture out  ,  without fear .
 believe in yourself chiu can .
 this is solid advice .
 just change job every 4 years .
 keep changing until your ability reach the peak ,  then u know ,  ok i am old liao .
 then change strategy ,  find a stable corporation and relax
 very myopic view .
 networking within an organisation is very important ,  oso a skill many sinkies don’t have .
 chiu network cos knowing people across different functions allow u to understand the business better and leverage on cross functional expertise to build your own projects and problem solve .
 dressel will send schooling to the tekong realm .
 show this thread to phelps to increase the chance

 but now not so sure .
 at first 1 thought is shoulder score .
 with thousands of them here ,  it &apos;s bound to happen .
 thought he/she is a troll ?
 like to post controversial thread then side pap to bait people  ?
 it &apos;s true ,  anyone who served ns should at least know his own post nsf unit .
 like moi served with the 688th sir .
 in fact moi remember seeing a pighchur of the 11th intake of 5 sir in edmw before .
 sounds like pukimak  !
 unless they are serving in a unit that is highly secretive .
 hello ccb pukimak kan  ?
 this might be the reason why .
 the  &apos;ate lots of fruit &apos; part is a perk for those to can forage fruits in the singapore jungles ,  there were rumors that there was a durian tree behind the ocs tower .

 if u re pretty or handsome  ,  alot of ways to make money .
 life is unfair .
 1 ethereum in singapore dollars is $6 , 375 .
 basically purchasing her photo for 1 .
 $10k for a photo  simps - simp is a slang insult for men who are seen as too attentive and submissive to women ,  especially out of a failed hope of winning some entitled sexual attention or activity from them .
 the word simp is meant to troll young men for doing anything for a girl to get some action he supposedly deserves .
 when chiu compare every reward with toto winning  ,  shows chiu really aren’t motivated to strive your way to success .
 life is not just about luck
 walan eh so many simps based out of singapore for a piece of p .
 y they wont even get to touch .
 typical mothersh1t headline ,  it &apos;s wrong .
 5 million is the traded volume ,  not how much she made from the sale .
 she made nothing from the initial sale cos it was a free mint .
 but she does a take a 7 .
 5% royalty cut of every sale as the creator .
 this is insane .
 how come its even worth so much ?
 simp is a slang insult for men who are seen as too attentive and submissive to women ,  especially out of a failed hope of winning some entitled sexual attention or activity from them .
 who so stewpig go buy ?

 mate ,  i am not young anymore .
 if i am young ,  oredi screw that basttart up ,  shoot mail to ceo ,  make sure that ceca lost his job .
 i network with other department staff too .
 try to be friendly n helpful n easy to talk person .
 why need to talk about colour ?
 if chiu are young in your 30s ,  yes good to datd move out .
 unless chiu have chance to move up .
 if your boss tells chiu wait and see .
 means he nt scared to lose chiu .
 a smart employee will take tt as sign to leave .
 chiu dont want to promote your employee ,  the answer hr will coach chiu to give is wait and see .
 continue to develop further .
 chiu scared your gf leave cos chiu look like dont want to marry .
 so chiu treat her nicer .
 buy her more things .
 spend more time with her .
 chiu want to faster give her engagement ring .
 if the girl is 5/10 and chiu dont care if she leave .
 chiu will always tell her .
 just wait and see .
 lets nt rush into marriage .
 the bto projects all nt gd .
 slowly wait for the right time .
 i hope sinkies dont kumgong let their boss con them and waste 5 yrs rotting .
 alot of edmwers are old uncles lol
 if chiu are fresh grad ,  good luck .
 most management and middle management are oni interested in themselves .
 their job is to lower costs for the company ,  when in turn reflects their performace (and bonuses) .
 thats why fresh grad salaries havent been moving for the past decade .
 alot of companies oni willing to pay  &apos;fresh grad &apos; salary while job requires years of experience .
 boss can dedicate projects to chiu ,  and let chiu handle .
 boss can even give u unofficial title of team lead or whatever .
 let chiu feel important and  &apos;song &apos; .
 but actual fact they are pushing their job to chiu ,  while reaping the rewards .
 anything goes wrong ,  chiu are held accountable .
 anything goes well ,  your boss gets promoted and salary increment while your boss give chiu reward by  &apos;words &apos; ie good job ,  well done etc .
 words cant pay your bills .
 if chiu are experiencing this ,  time to move on .
 why not talk less and actually go submit resume and interview elsewhere ?
 i went from 38k to 98k in 5 years by not sitting on my ass when facing this kind of boss .
 what happened if chiu are not a sociable person in the 1st place  ?
 this is oso why i hate the networking in work place for the sake of career progression .
 i dont like to make friend with any hidden agenda .
 pay n work environment lor .
 if u feel your pay is gd n work load is gd then continue .
 if u can find some job much better pay but job load oso ok then jump liao mai tu liao
 say u are hr manager .
 what u expect to be ?
 thats about the max anyone can go oredi .
 how many such roles in singapore ?
 form your own company secretly ,  then divert some of the new project there ,  earn separate income
 if chiu bad luck have ceca manager .
 suggest chiu go for cleanse n praying for protection .
 you’re not making friends .
 it’s just business .
 i face the same problem as bluezzy too .
 i joined the co 6 years back ,  taken up important projects .
 but no promotion at all .
 i take it as a way to build my resume .
 i do change boss in between .
 previous boss was manipulative .
 but new boss is that kind that will push all work to u ,  expect u to work after office hours while he mia during all important meetings .
 but this year i was given saikang that another colleague don’t want to do .
 she took up some of my scopes instead .
 so now i feel there is no growth on a personal level cos i feel the saikang make my resume look less attractive .
 i can choose to continue to stay here and retire here too .
 but i’m oni 34 - i’m not sure if it is too early to have that kind of mentality ?
 singapore to compare ba 
 everywhere is the same .
 ts can go jump around loh .
 eventually chiu will come to this conclusion .
 haha then nobody knows for sure if they are not him  
 lol boliao dont anyhow curse people .
 is he added into the count oreadi ?

 means useless ,  weak or cannot make it .

 this thread is not simple .
 this phrase has the added advantage of sounding more intelligent .
 another form is  &apos;xxx is not simple &apos; ,  where xxx refers to a name or person .
 the list now has to be splitted in 2 posts .
 ehzz lolz finally know what &apos;s camel toe !
  shud stickied to help plp like me ;p
 how come dont have pdf ?
 i studie till bored come upz thread for chiu all .
 still got  &apos;up lorry &apos; .
 added some general tips for understanding edmwish : .
 replace the letter  &apos;l &apos; with the letter  &apos;r &apos; and pronounce accordingly .
 look -> look ,  lock -> rock ,  plus -> prus .
 add the letter  &apos;s &apos; in front of words that starts with  &apos;ex &apos; .
 expose -> sexpose ,  experience -> sexperience .
 spell the word backwards .
 many terms are simply mispronounced words and spelled to reflect that pronunciation .
 just say the word out loud and chiu will probably know what it means .
 it helps alot if chiu understand hokkien .
 why -> huai ,  what -> huat ,  is -> is ,  clone -> krone
 feel free to ask about any terms chiu dont understand here .
 i am sure all the friendly and kind edmwers will be glad to explain .
 haha interesting thread
 this is an interesting thread .
 hope he will be here
 he is airing his balls at pulau ubin ?
 maybe finally succumbed to vaccination and  .

 maybe he kena banned
 go angmo land air balls liao la

 no time to post
 maybe he did that to feed himself and family
 just saw him at 10kukujiao last evening .

 people busy arranging his first class flight to tour europe liao la .
 bbfa edmw can eat his balls hairs only

 tiagong he jobless now  
 so rich can retire le .
 he drives for fun nia 
 maybe he go take part in squid game
 hope he and his family is alright !
 5 weekdays of 10 hours .
 + 1 weekend of 5 hours .
 = 55 hours liao leh
 thus chiu have bedok reservoir
 ot is self inflicted .
 i dont ot one .
 at most no bonus ,  or people say nia ,  i dont give a flying fuck about it .
 look at japanese people .
 work one of the longest hours .
 yet having the longest lifespan
 maybe must love your work first .
 ya i gonna mati soon  .
 12 hrs/ day x 5 days /wk
 i used to work 12h x6 days for ot money .
 longest stretch was 12h x11days (6 of which were night shift) cos my colleague took emergency sick leave .
 luckily i retire now .
 else sure mati .
 10-12h very normal for moi .
 upping lorry soon
 when they say working hours ,  got includes meal breaks ?
 or just generally end work time minus start work time ?
 unless u move to different field or start own business otherwise go everywhere roughly same sai
 if its my company of course i will try to stay as long as possible .
 if it &apos;s oredi ipo and i have cashed out after the mandatory 3years performance guarantee period ,  then i can leave anytime .
 but if ts is refering to a random company that i just happen to work in ,  without any responsibility ,  other than the exchange of my 8hours daily for salary .
 that is just a temporary contract .
 it can be broken when either side gave one month notice .
 as i said ,  it is purely up to u ,  if u want to connect and make friend
 don’t get busted .
 just highlighting the actual use of networking within the organisation
 most boss prefer u to do the same thing forever and ever ,  without asking him any question .
 cos if u dont do ,  who do ?
 new hire might not cope with the sai u handle .
 and if u still want to stay the same path (same role but more senior) ,  u have to replace your boss which he sees u as a threat .
 end of the day ,  when chiu are working for others ,  no one is irreplaceable .
 when i first started working ,  i used to think the company need me to proceed with so called urgent things and i must always work even though i am sick .
 haha ,  i was so wrong in my career experience with various companies ,  the urgent thing is always postponed until i return to work ,  or taken over by my subordinate or someone else to proceed first .
 as of now ,  if it still feeds chiu and your family well ,  not putting chiu into doing anything illegal ,  not risking your limbs and life ,  then it is good enough to stay on ,  until chiu find something better when that industry is more stable .
 wow someone revived this thread .
 at a great time too cos i would have like to update that i went to see my boss and big boss recently to just directly ask what is my prospect in the company .
 my big boss at first told me that there is no opening currently but i could continue to stay to see if got any open up in the future .
 so right after that i started sending out my resume and went for interviews .
 got offered jobs at some of them and i have accepted the job offer from my top choice .
 recently ,  went to see big boss again to let him know that i would be resigning and guess what ?
 he got upset and said until like i betrayed him for not consulting him beforehand .
 i told him i did and he said he didnt think i was considering seriously leaving the company .
 hope u got a good raise from the jump oso .
 moral of the story: wanna jump ga ga lai .
 dont let people take u for granted .
 never be loyalty towards your company .
 if the company want to stay afloat ,  they can sacrifice chiu without blinking their eye .
 that is true ,  i encounter myself .
 that is why now ,  i dont really care much .
 work ,  get pay ,  go home ,  .
 yup ,  got better prospect at the new place .
 plus it &apos;s a fresh new start .
 i havent told my colleagues yet that i am leaving .
 planning to just let them know closer to the date cos i am not that close to them anyway .
 your boss playing mind game ,  to make chiu feel guilty .
 dont fall into this trap .
 this is your life ,  your destiny  ,  your choice ,  your survival .
 nobody will help chiu if one day your existing company decided to kick chiu out of the company .
 if there is a opporunity outside with good prospect and higher salary ,  yes chiu have my support ,  go for it .
 i am not sure whether chiu will tell chiu colleagues where chiu are going .
 for me ,  no no no .
 i wont tell them where i go .
 usually i will tell them ,  ,  once i settle down ,  i let chiu know .
 haha yea ,  actually that day when he told me no opening for me despite me taking up so many projects to prove my worth ,  i have oredi made up my mind to leave .
 now just clear leave and wait for time to officially go .
 feels like a burden has been lifted off my shoulder .
 thanks to all the advice here that made me finally take the first step .
 they will likely ask and i will give them some vague answer .
 maybe buy some of those who work closely with me tea before leaving .
 dont want to burn bridges oso la .
 i prefer  &apos;im taking a break &apos; .
 whether the break is 1 day ,  1 week ,  or 1 year .
 it &apos;s not a lie .
 good luck mate .
 especially if the company has no intention to promote chiu up .
 taking a first time (jump out of the aeroplane) is the most scary part .
 it is where many ,  including me too ,  dare not .
 we freak out and how ?
 stick on the existing job .
 last year i was retrenched ,  boss told me my last day in the company ,  this is like facing the cloud and must jump out from the plane .
 if not crash i die .
 create resume ,  upload ,  this and that ,  interview .
 very very difficult moment .
 but i landed safety into a new company i never think of .
 all the best mate
 i must stay cos it &apos;s my own company .
 so far my company no ceca .
 south asian customers oso tend ot avoid ,  cause experienced most are cannon fairies waste our time one .
 got carbs ,  greens ,  protein all in 1 .
 human greatest invention .
 add fish not cheap liao
 no chicken eat fish .
 fish too ex ,  eat egg .
 depends on what dishes u picked
 one year 365 days .
 i eat cai png less than 10 times .
 agree with this ,  i usually pick chicken and 2 vege .
 pang sai sure very smooth .
 atas bbfa has spoken .
 u do know its originated food for coolies ?
 bbfa oni choose fried chikon ,  gu lu york and salted egg .
 so for them it’s a deadly combination
 i add fish ended up $12 .
 u atas gv gold class italiano
 chiu everyday eat same stall ,  same dishes ?
 any health guru can clarify ?
 i thought the oil they use is sebei unhealthy one ?
 if chiu order all the fried stuff is oso unhealthy  .
 some days i go vegetarian and order oni veges .
 always kena suan by the guy and say i never let him earn by not ordering meat
 abt the same ,  yes .
 too bad the cai png standard nearby is bad while good one further away .
 else i don’t mind eating cai png all day
 dont mind the small details la .
 i know of vegetarians who rather order from cai png stall .
 alot vegetarian stall sport all the high gluten stuff n expensive mock meat .
 while cai png can buy taogei ,  cabbage and cauliflower .
 which typically vegetarian stalls dont have   .
 the job application form usually will have this question - do chiu object to us doing reference check with your ex company ?
 or during the interview ,  they ask chiu verbally if can do reference check with your ex company .
 have chiu ever reject them before ?
 what to say to reject them ?
 say chiu are not on good terms with your ex nanager ?
 chiu want the job chiu must do reference check .
 if not ,  can join sda .
 chiu go prison before or have pending case ,  oso they accept chiu .
 u reject the check - hr oredi detect chiu got issue ,  suggest hiring mgt to drop chiu .
 so unwritten rule is no reject ref check .
 easier to just say chiu found a job no need to proceed .
 tell them your corlicks are not your friends  .
 so their evaluation wont be fair 
 job interviewer will always do reference check ?
 i thought chiu list your own references in your cv ?
 problem is i cant even think of one who will say good things about me 
 can ,  this is a free country and chiu are free to reject .
 some is professional and even put in good words for chiu .
 chiu gauge your manager is what pattern lor .
 chiu can reject personal reference check ,  but if it’s reference check for past employment details ,  chiu must not reject as it’s a very negative sign .
 why would chiu oppose to a new company checking on your past employment tenure and last position held ?
 however ,  for personal reference check ,  i have rejected before .
 there was this mnc that asked me to list down 2 referees and i told them i will not be providing personal reference checks .
 they asked why (which is normal)  ,  i just told them i have not informed anyone on my upcoming move to this new co and i prefer to keep it confidential for now .
 the hr didn’t pursue any further .
 they did however proceeded with employment checks but dropped the personal reference checks .
 they are oso free to not proceed with your application .
 it’s a free world
 more likely they reject chiu from refusing to provide reference check 
 actually what they do ah ?
 call your current boss ?
 what about those stat board checks ?
 is there any practice of getting a leaving testimonial ?
 at least ,  if the ref call result is undesirable ,  at least have a testimonial to say otherwise .
 no scared if nothing to hide
 chiu can ,  they are oso free to reject your application 
 now is not job seeker market .
 lan lan must follow their request
 your surname is ong ?
 some gahment dept/stat board will do reference check
 a british groom and an indian bride ,  who have become the latest foreigners to choose turkey as their wedding destination ,  have tied the knot in a 48-hour-long wedding ceremony held in the southwestern province of muğla .
 however ,  alex hampson ,  30 ,  and jas pavit ,  25 ,  differed from all foreign couples by choosing the rural district of menteşe instead of the world-renowned tourism hotspot bodrum .
 based on their cultures ,  the couple got married after performing two different wedding ceremony rituals held in two days .
 “we hosted the couple and their 50 guests in a valley in the yenice neighborhood ,  which has no connection to the aegean sea .
 this is a first for menteşe , ” çağlar bozkurt ,  the business owner who organized the ceremonies ,  told the demirören news agency .
 “we decorated two different locations ,  one based on british and the other on indian traditions , ” he added .

 what this will do is to kill the music industry .
 or at least maimed it .
 culture revolution of some sort .
 no artistic expressions allowed .
 next time oni have the great xi songs will have copyrights like north korea .
 back to good good study ,  day day up .
 and set itself apart from the rest of the world .
 hip hip hurray to kind and benevolent leader winnie pooh xi .
 this is a good move by the national copyright administration of cheena .
 normally ,  such action would be taken by the competition regulator .
 it stops music platforms from locking up swarth of music as exclusive offering .
 music will have to be licensed to all competing streaming platforms ,  thus offering choice to the chinese consumers .
 another hit on the alibaba and tencent ecosystems .
 ccp dont care abt copyright ,  ccp oni care abt grabbing it all ,  its pap on steroids .
 counter monopoly  ?
  i think amazon has this issue ,  i was told .
  when chiu publish your book on their site ,  chiu cannot sell elsewhere .
   given their size ,  the perpectuate their monopoly .
 where is dip dip
 how about  &apos;techno cheespie &apos;  ?
 i heard before but dunno what is means .
 is the condom too big for chiu ?
 couple of updates : .
 : ah-bu-neh-neh .
 a possibly racist term that refers to an indian person .
 : deep deep = very much ,  alot ,  deeply .
 frequently used together with  &apos;lub &apos; .
 i is lub chiu dip dip .
 (see oso lub) .
 : gong gong dai dai (hokkien) = stupid .
 : oni (hokkien) .
 used at the end of a sentence to play down something that has been overestimated .
 : a meaningless prefix added to the word cheesepie .
 origin : in the singapore-made movie  &apos;881 &apos; ,  there was a scene where the character  &apos;auntie ling &apos; asked  &apos;wang lei &apos; what is the meaning of  &apos;techno &apos; .
 wang lei gave a long-winded nonsense answer that pissed off auntie ling and she scolded him  &apos;techno chee ko pek &apos; (ie .
 from then on ,  the word  &apos;techno &apos; has been added as a prefix to various terms .
 any lao jiao with phd mastery in edmwish can confirm whether the origin of  &apos;techno cheesepie &apos; is correct ?
 i think oni ahgong hippo use this .
 any parrot lingos ?
 huai is neber add raisin (nipples) & oso huai is this thread not sticky yet ?
 y no  &apos;peekture &apos; ?
 should add in no x no talk where x is pic/link/video/guts .
 why wont someone make this a sticky ?
 ahgong_hippo is invented many many colourful lingo .
 is must be from all the years of eating salt .
 what do u mean by  &apos;parrot lingos &apos; ?
 parrots just echo what they heard ,  dont they ?
 raisin is added many many moons ago le .
 labia majora is actually vulva .

 oh isnt this the guy who daily hope hdb price to go higher like he own hdb ?
 so is some jiuhu guy ah .
 [everyday and everything kpkb] observations on malaysians working in singapore .
 do chiu agree with this observation ?
 i remember he said want to sell his hdb for 2mil ,  i asked sell oredi or not ,  he say why not 3mil ,  then tell me not to be jelly cos i cannot afford 
 that is calvin cheng &apos;s estrogen
 hdb should be oni for sinkies .
 and hdb is too cheap
 remind me of an incident ,  last year i was walking with a colleague whos pay about 2+k ,  a porche zoom past .
 my colleague:  &apos;400k car want show off what &apos; .
 just ignore him
 i remember another user asked pukunara which unit did this user served in ,  didnt think puku answered concisely .
 most of us who actually served could remember the unit that we served in .
 either is zhabor or foreigner exemption ,  though there are secret units formed no doubt but that is left to be speculated .
 foreign agent lai de .
 purposely stir edmwers hatred towards pappy govt
 nobody who served ns can actually forget the unit they served in la .
 ns is a traumatic experience hor .
 he &apos;s a south asian .
 i knew very long ago just that i never sexpose him directly 
 i is remember this too .
 pukunara didnt catch the keyword .
 i doubt pukunara is a local zhabor ,  cos he/she is oso pro-endemic living .
 people who are pro endemic living in singapore .
 dont have elderly parents here .
 dont have yang chewren  .
 want to leave singapore .
 that makes pukunara either a yang ib or a foreigner .
 but yang kid cant possibly own hdb ,  i bet my money on naturalised ft who owns hdb ,  waiting for endemic and travel corridor so he can sell his unit and profit .
 i think he is sleeping in the taxi ?
 fellow edmw can help to check for stationary taxi .
 not vaccinated ,  if go ,  cannot take the vtl back and need to shn upon return .

 he told me the opposite
 the way he can type and lie to cause edmwers to believe him convincingly
 this guy is a troll most likely overseas laughin at edmw bbfa who believes his story
 elite or teksi driver ,  covid doesnt discriminate .
 i wish him well .
 years ago i started a thread on how i build an arcade machine with basic tools .
 he pmed me to express interest .
 he was the head of department of a foreign bank ,  retrenched after many years of service .
 the severance package is more than $500k .
  since i lived in a landed ,  we discussed investing in landed houses at other regions of the island .
 unfortunately we didnt meet as i migrated to australia shortly .
 this was many many many years ago  .
 now can just install retropi or buy the cheena machine 
 maybe succumbed to covid ?
 he probably on flight to germany now .
 laughing at your post while he teh amdl nehneh and drinking bier during oktoberfest
 airing his balls in the corridor .
 with vtl ,  most likely this rich bro has booked an air ticket to enjoy his oversea holidays liao  .
 rich people wont travel during a pandemic .
 ibetyou he went overseas vtl on holiday .
 lol at his taxi story  ……
  he using imagination do taxi marathon ?
 he go take vaccine now tio ko  ?
 haha hint hint .
 need to bring in more ceca liao
 very bullsh1ting article .
 can train grab riders to do it ?
 of cos is possible in the dreams
 why dont they open in ceca land .
 the land of excess talent and the next superpowa !
 fintech firm nium &apos;s 250-strong engineering team is in india .
 its 13-strong team of product managers is being doubled in singapore ,  ceo prajit nanu said .
 singapore &apos;s open economy was hit hard by the pandemic ,  airlines and tourism in particular ,  and former singapore airlines flight attendant alloysius lee is thankful he decided to study data analytics .
 put two and two means air bubble with india for ceca to fly over and work in ceca company under ict ?
 song boh bubble ong
 need to bring in more foreigners .
 amazing that ceca with uptrons education can produce enough talents for the world compare to nus/ntu .
 strawberries study high .
 but job give to ceca .
 rental give selfish gen .
 grab job for strawberries
 sounds like the cecapura we envisioned .
 chiu forgot elites and pap scholar generals assured cushy job for life with million dollar salaries and no blame culture
 selfish gen busy discriminate own people to feel satki meritocracy .
 but let ceca have everything cos of rental incum and property appreciation
 open legs wider
 how many straight a students can do tech  with the bell curve .
 the pap gahment will always be on the side of sinkies .
 there is no point creating jobs for foreign tech talents if it does not benefit sinkies .
 foreign tech talents help us to grow the economy ,  create good jobs for sinkies and raise our standards of living .
 by being open to foreign tech talents ,  we create more opportunities for ourselves .
 if that is so ,  the singapore gahment needs to look itself in the mirror and ask themselves what went wrong with their education policies ?
 why is the singapore education system unable to churn out the talent it needs to grow ?
 that means there &apos;s something wrong with the system .
  who is responsible for the screw-up and why was the problem allowed to fester for so many years ?
 it &apos;s not a talent issue .
  it &apos;s about wanting cheap !
 it &apos;s about greed !
 instead of racing to the top through productivity growth and innovation ,  the singapore gahment and companies have joined the global race to the bottom to grow by cutting cost and acquiring the cheapest manpower !
 can they dont use singapore-based which is foreign
 those by chen lin and aradhana aravindan are 158th pap cock sucker .
 tiktok owner bytedance comes to singapore cos usa fark them .

 in the past year ,  i &apos;ve seen some of the replies and comments in this forum .
 im sure and confident most of u are way better ,  more capable than most of these cecas getting paid handsomely in banks doing ai ,  big data ,  analytics ,  forecasting .
 by now ,  im sure most of u in analytics know that mgmt needs input from chiu to make critical decisions .
 your job is important .
 i cant question my ceo for replacing the head with this ceca md who in in turned hired nothing but cecas to work for him .
 mom needs to wake up and smell the air .

 the whole platoon decimated in the exercise becuase i am unable to support their positions .
 saw go spare barrel like gpmg or not ?
 got spare barrel .
 the video shows the m-249 minimi ,  which can be belt felt  .
 think the melted part is a add-on muzzle/flash supressor ,  not the barrel  .
 people making the video so stupid .
 just wedge the trigger instead having a person there .
 i remember for gpmg ,  after every belt ,  must change the barrel .
 but we never do that during live firing .
 this is not a plbb thread .
 always ia before the first bullet can fire off .
 then have to shout  &apos;bang bang bang !
 oni kum gong will fire .
 chiu fire one round oni ,  go back must clean the gun till hand swollen .
 just use mouth bang bang bang can oredi .
 sticky fren kena burn by gpmg barrel during company exercise .
 put the red hot barrel down then forget put his hands on it .
 go jungle do section movement with sar21 oso just shout bang bang bang ,  ia ia ia .
 when exercise cut ,  open rifle ,  clean and oil a bit can go send arms ,  relak liao .
 oni see those kum gong still at training shed ,  need to clean and double clean to clear armorer inspection
 if chiu fire 1 box of ammo ,  might as well continue to fire more  .
 have to clean anyway   .
 same same but different  .
 we given 100 rounds per belt to zhua oni .
 and no silencer .
 red hot barrel .
 last time i is remember full auto 1 full mag and barrel looks liddat .
 neh melt though .
 super regret cos gosh back clean barrel until siao .
 please dont do that unless chiu like cleaning barrels .
 the ones the armory has always ia anyway  .
 i thought live one easier to clean ?
 just tolong dont ask fire blanks .
 see blanks = auto geh geh ia no matter what 
 thot sop is change barrel until 3 magazine
 by the way ,  anyone knows if can order the side dishes without rice ?
 got what healthy options ar ?
 moi oso agree with ts .
 other thing like chicken rice ,  bcm ,  wanton mee all no vege oso .
 yong tau not nice if dont have fry item .
 happen to me ,  after i say i am leaving my boss said oh i was going to ask hr for xxxxx$ for u ,  bs la .
 is it the same my boss give a junior more work than myself ?
 i realise i working number of years same as boss - .
 how gam are chiu with your boss ?
 yea ,  if chiu read my posts at the beginning of this thread - i was feeling very fearful and uncertain .
 went into a short period of depression and saw a counsellor who oso advised me to jump ship .
 any advice for how to have a good beginning at the new place ?
 my big boss was trying to suss out what i got from the other place .
 then he said he is sure it wont be much different from what he was oredi offering .
 couldnt even bring himself to say congrats and wish me well at the new place .
 all the true colours coming out - i realised then i made the right choice to leave .
 if u ever consider it means its time to leave liao
 i am sorry to hear your situation .
 hope chiu are ok now .
 we face lots of uncertainty about whether the colleagues good or not ,  manager good or not ,  the environment good or not .
 we fear we might not be able to learn fast enough .
 but please believe in yourself .
 have plenty of sleep and rest before going to work .
 try to learn as much as possible .
 do not be afraid to ask if chiu are in doubt .
 it will be tough but i believe chiu can make it .
 i ever posted (not sure where) ,  there is no such thing as loyalty anymore .
 lots of fake colleagues  .
 just like your case ,  your manager show chiu true colour .
 i ever too ,  when they dunnid your services ,  all true colour comes out .
 that is why now ,  i oni work for a living ,  not work for colleagues .
 oso a new environment is something no everybody dare to try too .
 nobody ,  including me ,  would want to jump out of our comfort zone .
 out of our zone ,  we dunno what will happen to us .
 the fear we have .
 but is the ship is going to sink ,  we have to jump .
 it &apos;s almost never; loyalty counts for nothing nowadays .
 aiyo just leave la ,  some people leave instantly 30%-70% pay increase leh bro
 after i have made the decision ,  i felt better cos i was not so torn by my indecisiveness anymore
 throw letter le .
 now just waiting for time to officially go  
 lmao at your previous big boss !
  such a loser !
 my current gm oso think the company pay chiu salary ,  can t̶e̶l̶l̶ order chiu to do whatever they want chiu to do .
 i am trying to recall one short clip ,  bout 3 min ,  damn i forgot the name of the clip ,  it is about 2 guy and 2 mice ,  looking for corn .
 i am trying to recall the title .
 i let chiu know asap .
 i just cant recall it now .
 i am searching google .
 the clip might help chiu become more stronger .
 if got many chio bu ols ,  then worth staying
 make sure got enough time for them to treat chiu farewell lunch 
 yes chiu can lor .
 seen many ol do this  .
 best food for bbfa
 sometimes very oily & saltish
 salt level is a bit high  ,  not actually healthy
 home cook meal is most balanced/healthy ,  u have full control from ingredient to cooking .
 most cai png stores though have some variety but mostly are too oily or overly salty stuff .
 those cai png store food not exactly v hygienic either ,  meat exposed to our warm humid climate for long hours ,  the warmer just keep warm make the dishes the best place place for bacteria to multiple and not to mention most veg are not cleaned properly u eating in alot of pesticide and stuff .
 chiu buy those whole fish is it ?
 there is no meat at vegetarian stall .
 then chiu dunnid to be millionaire to retire .
 just $400k enough  .
 eat fish must eat whole  .
 greatest thing since sliced  .
 town council ,  utilities ,  medical expenses ,  groceries ,  fibre subscription ,  mobile plan blah blah .
 not oni cai png leh .
 chiu live a fancy life .
 i choose those fake fish .
 batter alot meat little inside .
 can console myself since i add fish alrdy .
 feel high ses  .
 up a bit eat nasi padang .
 i love their sambal chicken ,  it &apos;s one big piece eat until shiok !
 i usually order steam egg + gong bao chicken + veg  .
 considered healthy mah ?
 well balanced meal .
 chiu will live until 90yo .
 is not balanced at all when u know how they cook the vegetables .
 thats when u wont dare to ever choose vegetables again
 tats the reason y i eat cp .
 can get a decent 1 serving of veg
 i believe he didnt think i have the courage to move out the comfort zone lol
 but they may not hiew chiu wor

 phv drivers lead a honest life while su insurance agents are out to scam you
 but phv drivers have no brains .
 one of them provide a tangible service
 it is true ,  insurance payouts can save lives .
 my insurance agent is taller than me in heels leh .
 can oni look up at her leh .
 then grab drivers deliver my food almost every week leh .
 who am i to look down on people doing decent jobs for a living ?
 not all agents are scrums .
 but the ones who paddle investment-linked insurances are definitely scrums .
 your engrish grade confirm chop b3 and below .
 as long as they don’t personally bother me (phv driver prying into my personal life during chat ,  insurance agent keep pushing product)
 look down on people not doing anything and having the mentality the whole world owes them a good life .
 why would chiu compare them as a whole .
 one is leech ,  one is hard work .
 many insurance agents earning big money ,  enjoy riches ,  all these through their hard work of selling .
 while i dont look down on them ,  i think none of them should be in the job .
 it &apos;s a job that will become obsolete eventually ,  meaning ,  chiu dunnid a human to drive a vehicle for transportation .
 so work in such a job means what ?
 means it &apos;s a huge waste of what humans are capable of .
 of precious time .
 all grab/phv drivers should rather use their time to do other more useful and meaningful jobs .
 maybe it &apos;s good money but it &apos;s not sustainable .
 and benefits and safety net suck to non existent .
 in singapore there seems to be a very large number of people working transport or delivery jobs for grab and other similar co .
 while your foreign talents take up cushy and proper and high paying jobs .
 it &apos;s really sad to see .
 something is seriously wrong with this country .
 respect both professions .
 insurance ,  property agents and contractors are the scums of society !
 if they can cheat and sell your grandma for a cent ,  they would
 middle men ,  they add no value and try too hard .
 no slouching or rounding your shoulders ?
 answer is nope for me .
 my instinct is to slouch bend my spine when i sit on chair at home pcw on edmw .
 same when riding bicycle .
 same when eating out(last time before covid restrictions) at kopitiam on kopitiam chair .
 same when riding motor
 after awhile need to slouch
 nowadays most of the chai png not cheap .
 last time 2 veg 1 meat $3 .
 but my cai png always no greens
 just finished watching cna right ?
 but chiu always have a choice next time  .
 the wonders of cai png .
 hipster act healthy version cai png is wafuken .
 at 2 , 3x price of cos .
 when i am busy outside and no time to eat a healthy meal ,  i usually head to cai png stall and order 3 veges ,  1 fish ,  no rice .
 all the plain type ,  no batter and no sauce .
 better than nothing .
 it &apos;s a scare tactic to see if you &apos;re edgy about it .
 ts dont want new company to know chiu are edmwer ah ?
 if chiu didnt manage to get anyone at work willing to even reference for chiu .
 chiu are the problem .
 that is why no matter how bloody bad your manager is .
 never burn bridge .
 the whole personal reference check thing is damn archaic and ineffective .
 if i get to put 2 referees ,  of course i will oni put those who have oni good things to say about me right ?
 if i have bad blood with my manager ,  would i include him ?
 of course not !
 therefore such reference checks will oni yield sugar-coated and positive feedback .
 this should be abolished .
 ts why chiu refuse ?
 something to hide cannot expose ?
 agreed that this process is very wayang (for show only) .
 some companies will call the hr direct and ask for previous line manager
 does not make sense leh .
 usually people change job is cos dislike the boss ,  work culture ,  workload .
 why do chiu need ref check from someone i am escaping from
 just need check whether the resume is true or not (ie ,  get them to produce payslip ,  period of employment) ,  validate reason for leaving ,  test their skills and knowledge and gauge whether they would be suitable fit for the company .
 monkey see money do
 u can reject them .
 same thing ,  the company can reject your jod application also
 if u gan yr boss then kena pok from previous job how ?
 if ask to verify period of employment then ok la .
 cannot ask about performance ,  attitude since it is quite bias .
 if everything is good then why do people change jobs
 but they will reject your application too .
 the thing is those petty selfish boss will purposely sabo chiu for leaving the company
 our local hr really leaves much to be desired .
 if chiu look at job application forms ,  it’s oso ridiculous .
 alot of times they need chiu to write your past employment history and education when all this information is oredi in your cv !
 so every applicant now has to waste time doing duplicate work .
 but our hr won’t suggest to scrap this requirement cos they are usually one-track mind .
 they don’t really use their brains to think ,  but just do what they have always been doing for the past 20 years .
 then they can oso choose not to hire chiu .
 moi think is jhk .
 try to act like got serve then after that try to flip say is female .
 he is son of donkey and his ceca wife
 probably some underachieving civil servant looking to prep their upcoming appraisal with “covid vaxx grassroots activism” bah
 i think some guesses here are right .
 south asian origin .
 oily hair with some sourish aroma .
 post in topics where he can score pa points .
 likely work civil service maybe pa .
 loves his chapatis and chai .
 loves travel especially his motherland for the smells .
 i am sure there are more traits discovered by others here
 ex mp lee bee wa .
 rmfao ,  eben if dat idiot is foleigner ,  chiu think pap will fica sumhuan who is sarking deir corks non stop ?
 just put into ignore rist and move on
 same trolling style as lisalim .
 still can think of any other such accounts ?
 tia gong is an annoying and act smart donkey  .
 ib skills oso cmi everyday plp
 i think he is a hardcore opposition supporter .
 his style is reverse psychological type ,  cause his extremeness is backfiring .
 instead of making pap look good ,  it’s focusing on their shortfall instead
 i think he is a malaysian pretending to be local .
 keep calm ladies and gentlemen .
 i dont support any political parties .
 just singapore gahment supporter .
 chiu think too highly of such lowly lackeys .
 they are really pitiful at times when they collect their payouts .
 practically beg for those dollars and damn lao kui to tell friends and family that chiu stooped do low .
 may he be reborn as a better person in his next life
 supporting singapore gahment is wrong  ?
 maybe in edmw oni .
 in reality majority support singapore gahment .
 u know y want exposure this open secret .
 imagine all ignore his/her threads ,  he/she talking to air  .
 why never pee on the barrel 
 suppressor meltdown ,  barrel still have integrity .
 how about mg barrel split into half during live firing ?
 fire blanks give more soots than live rounds  .
 usually after a long ,  multi days exercise ,  we dip parts of the gun into engine oil before we start cleaning  .
 possible ,  it is not like saf light weapons are pre-loved with careful owners .
 1206 for everyone in the company .
 live firing cut to find the missing half barrel
 nothing of that kind .
 its ******** becuase ,  as a mg gunner chiu cannot keep that kind of firing up .
 the recoil and firing bursts spare not your eardrum and shoulder .
 moreover such kind of firing harms more than shooting accuracy at the target .
 chiu kill your platoon mates as well .
 control bursts is the way to go .
 i melted 2 gpmg when i dual wielded them during reservist .
 used the melted metal as projectiles .
 mg seems to melt alot ,  if not the firing pin then the barrel .
 the angmo melted theirs defending their position against the communist .
 had to pee on it to cool it down
 heng the heavy weapons are well taken care of ,  my 84 was shiny .
 last time need to wait for airdrop for m249
 so strawberry ,  fire tiny automatic weapon oni make so much noise over cleaning it .
 like this those drivers clean and maintain 7 ton truck how ?
 maybe troll until covid got him .
 he &apos;s intelligent ,  if he is a troll like how everyone believes; then props to him .
 he got the majority hoodwinked into believing whichever he wants to .
 good job ,  it will prove people are able to believe what they want or vice versa .
 moi always knew @broadwalk shushu is notch simpurz one !
 he &apos;s well dressed/groomed and speaks well and presents himself well one !
 i am oso unvax ,  never wfh ,  over 40+ ,  priss notice moi as well .
 is he really single and virgin ?
 he told me never touch women before ?
 but he likey u de
 i just dream of him yesterday and it was not a pleasant dream .
 chiu know how he look like ?
 he got give 4 numbers  ?
 his balls kena covid cos air it too much  .
 now balls in a jar under qo
 another unvaxx bites the dust   .
 maybe he using clone account to browse edmw
 people take a break from edmw la
 he might not be the driver .
 he despatched one of his many drivers to pick u
 why would anyone reveal his severance package to someone first met ?
 u guys hit it off so well ?
 one road good walk
 the cases are on the rise but there are still people who are supporting opening up and begging the mtf not to go into cb again .
 may i know what job you’re working as and how cb will affect your livelihood ?
 can let me know what your realistic solution is ?
 hide for the next 5 years while we close up singapore entirely ?
 watch as sia either uplorry or continue to take billions from taxpayers ?
 no need to close but we should keep up the strict control without allowing it to spread like wildfire .
 life and economy can still go on with strict control .
 its false dicotomy thinking that our country will uplorry if we dont do this kind of reckless endemic approach .
 want to open up are either in f&b business or rental business .
 moi in it ,  huat until siao .
 closed down or open oso same thing
 covid will oni be gone after everybody got it and it become just like flu .
 that is endemic and thats why we need to open up ,  to let it spread naturally .
 these kind of controls will just make covid a 50 years problem ,  can chiu imagine your kids growing up not knowing what it &apos;s like to live without masks ?
 this got to stop now .
 open or close; just want gahment to say wfh as default/encouraged so can continue wfhhhhh .
 if got +ve case ,  quarantine plus contact trace ,  and not do nothing .
 this will ensure company have oni essential people back and wfh still continue .
 how long more anti vaxxer wants to be locked down ?
 people jobless ,  hard to find a decent job now ,  bto delay until child oso grow up ,  cannot travel ,  mental health issue ect .
 why ts support wearing mask till die ,  cannot travel overseas ,  no large scale events ?

 toufu is everywhere 2nite .
 is stomp it consider a acronyms or lingo  ?
 i think we are doing quite ok here .
 a list of terms organise in alphabetical order and chiu can search using your browser &apos;s search function .
 bookmarked for easy reference .
 what chiu have done looks better aesthetically ,  but it &apos;s mainly a list of name-calling with no real benefits .
  please forgive me being unable to understand what chiu are trying to achieve there .
 nice consolidation by luffy
 should be a lingo .
 maybe will add it together with the next batch .
 cos me is no pcw hor .
 whats the meaning of pew pew pew ?
 i am guessing thats the sound of laser guns firing .
 luffy ,  u can consider putting .
  &apos;this thread is not simple &apos;  ?
 maybe say it &apos;s a way to pruss wan ?
 eh luffy not all the terms are specific to edmw .
 some edmw borrowed from other places like 154th is from sammyboy .
 kknbccb all this is local lingo .
 by the way notice the double standards here .
 people type ahneh wa everyone say racist .
 ahtiong oso quite racist but of course it dont matter ,  even though majority here is like a few generations from ahtiong .
 some lagi worse born in chenna family read cheena papers .
 what does it mean ?
 and i thought i saw a thread is hao ren one ?
 it means bullet bullet brap brap .
 hao ren is lagi more better .
 this is cool language to learn .
 not cecas ,  tiongs .
 guy left grab for bytedance .
 problem with tech is that it maps poorly to a level results .
 either chiu have it or chiu dont .
 why dont they move the hq to cecaland ?
 cheaper and there is no need to pay for housing and etc .
 moi applied 100+ jobs notch a single call
 unleash the horde !
 chiu want to move a tiong company into cecaland ?
 chiu want your shop to be trashed isit ?
 need more hindi speaking talent
 what jobs chiu applied for ?
 what qualifications chiu have ?
 a hint to import more ceca
 so how much is xiao salary ?
 there is no hindi speaking requirement in tiong company .
 otoh ,  tiong company o level chinese is good enough .
 lai liao lai liao .
 which country is talent surplus .
 tiong got more talent than ceca .
 think at company will prefer to hire at too right
 will become yellow or brown .
 cos need to soak in water 1st .
 then cannot over cooked .
 normally those green ones are tough .
 i prefer more soft 
 time to move on ,  it means chiu are expected to stay stagnant while he keeps moving up
 might just go with a few close ones .
 the fake ones i doubt they will bother to organise anything .
 he is dumping the sai kang to junior no good meh ?
 oni different is i notice mouth sweeter all boss will like better right .
 but i oso will scare do little become no value ):
 oso dont act too smart until your boss feels threatened by chiu .
 sometimes must act act ask for his advice even if chiu oredi know how to do .
 it boosts their ego .
 this one true ah ,  at least something positive to look forward to .
 if company sausage fest and bad envrionment ,  zhao la !
 proof that opportunities are abound and u just have to try .
 best of luck at your new workplace
 1) no promotion at all .
 pay increment just a little bit but everyone else in the company oso got it .
 2) not that i know of .
 but recently when i went to ask ,  they just said no opening currently .
 can oni continue to wait .
 3) i led project teams formally this year .
 represented the team to present to clients etc .
 4) boss has a bigger boss .
 direct boss is oso quite new in the company - around two to three years ?
 5) my dept is the biggest in the company .
 there are people who are being promoted but they usually belong to the  &apos;inner circle &apos; ,  basically the clique who got along well with the higher ups and i am not part of them .
 chiu dont knw hw happy i am for chiu .
 i hope people can got inspiration from your story .
 when chiu are senior/sme .
 bt your boss giv those kind of lan cheow reply continue to stay to see .
 start applying outside .
 if others offer 20% more .
 is means your boss value chiu 20% less .
 if your current boss think chiu need further development when chiu is team sme .
 is mean your career hit ceiling liao .
 chiu stay means chiu stupid .
 i dont knw hw many times i see people like chiu leave .
 excuses is no opening ,  chiu need furhter development .
 after they leave as asst manager ,  the job ad is ask for manager/senior manager .
 eh kenasai ,  simi no opening ?
 remb to say in exit interview tt your boss never plan to promote chiu .
 chiu quote those pr answer he giv chiu .
 back up with your achievements .
 is nice farewell gift for your boss from hr .
 dont be like those beta sinkies everything scared to burn bridges .
 some bridges can burn and screw people .
 he dangle carrot to exploit chiu longer means he alrdy dont see chiu up so he had alrdy decided to burn tt bridge long ago .
 what can hr do to the boss ?
 hr can fuck the boss or manager or whatsoever meh ?
 i think likely they will just cover it up and faster put up new job ads that all
 tt is a self defeating mindset there .
 cannot think your 1 sentence got no effect .
 chiu knw some places .
 if 2 people tender within 6 mths .
 hr will alrdy mark the manager .
 my peer kena similar before .
 hire new guy ,  he tender 7 mths later after prob end .
 hr grill him  .
 give him manager coaching tips .
 next time he go for next promotion .
 interview panel will see tt .
 people will question if he is suitable for more senior role .
 sinkies dont knw hw to do exit interview .
 chiu cannot say politics ,  boss dont like me .
 boss favour others .
 this kind cannot back up .
 tts why i tell ts must back up with achievements .
 then hr might see a trend tt this boss dont knw hw to groom and retain talent .
 i think most companies will not approve hubby n wife work in the same coy .
 nowadays with many work from home .
 dunnid anymore .
 chiu may not agreed with me but it is ok .
 just my thoughts .
 why grill  him ?
 n give him coaching etc ?
 should sack him with immediate effect .
 if in those glc like .
 s***tel ,  those probably wont work .
 they just dont have that kind of culture
 agree with chiu ?
 soulblader_89 was talking to me .
 as for me ,  i found out why n what happen to the staff i am taking over .
 not due to work but the manager bad attitude and bad character .
 my section most high turn over rate .
 promotion means more work .
 some people dont want to be promoted
 lame excuse for pap to hire more ceca !
 ceca uptron u yes .
 not uptron u errrrrrr chiu guess
 many sinkie engineers chao go overseas ,  dont want to come back .
 they promise jobs if come back ,  but no job !
 remember ,  they always speak the opposite !
 32 years old with the skill - ok ,  .
 42 years old with the same skill ,  - see got any better candidate first .
 52 years old with better skills ,  - sorry uncle ,  chiu better get ready to retire liao !
 question to edmwers - if a company creates 100 jobs here ,  but 50 go to fts ,  and 50 to sinkies ,  will chiu be happy ?
 other option is we don’t let the company hire 50 fts ,  so company go to some other country — so ,  sinkies lose out on 50 jobs oso .
 pap said 67 leh !
 so which farker is right  ?
 chiu the faggot or the farking pap ?
 just watch all 4 seasons finished .
 very touched by the theme and all .
 any similar recommendations ?
 looking for good animation and story ,  not hentai .
 wondering if can use this as a reason to reject them from doing reference check .
 if chiu say this ,  kiss good bye to the job opportunity .
 put your foot down and just say no .
 say your reasons: .
 might have biased reviews .
 not indicative of future relationships as the people are different
 but actually isnt that weird .
 doing reference check of your current company .
 imagine ,  they go call your current company hr and said so and so is currently looking for a new job ,  any comments ?
 what will the current company think ?
 must provide reference .
 else is an immediate red flag .
 rather not be hired by a coy that does this .
 most probably those that got hired are the ones who spend more time socializing and playing politics than doing actual work .
 if a coy hr made such a request .
 i won’t just turn down the request ,  i will turn down the entire job offer .
 cesspool of cucks doing mutual masturbation
 i beg to defer on contractors .
 direct contractors are needed .
 interior designers are then the middleman scums .
 i feel it’s the opposite can be true as well .
 frankly i never see a need for insurance agents  ,  they are just an additional layer that provides 0 additional value .
 maybe last time boomers generation they blur blur everything consult their “friendly and trustworthy“ agent .
 but the new generation is definitely not liddat .
 1 app or website  ,  agents will be obsolete
 i look down on those edmwers who are not better then them but look down on them  .
 these group the ultimate loser 
 insurance cannot buy online ?
 still need agents ?
 this job will eventually be obsolete oso right ?
 chiu mean persistant peddling and hard selling of those ilp scams ?
 grab drivers are the unfortunates in our society .
 i think insurance/financial portfolios can just set up an app/website ,  list details and let us buy ourselves .
 dont waste money on commissions ,  meaningless awards ,  round table **** ,  put more money into tech and investments .
 i dont want to judge anyone but phv drivers are more kelian .
 grab phv dont cheat and lie to sell chiu stuff .
 i oni look down on those who pay $ for an uptron cert and still got approved to work in singapore at higher management position
 look down on ts
 i have not met any honest insurance agent yet .
 thou chiu have a kueh stall ?
 insorlan and por pie tee agent are the worst .
 dont have la ,  couldnt agree on certain things and on advice from godma ,  we didnt take up  .
 now just tender for nea stalls see how ,  not a good chance it seems
 yeah cos they have an incentive to sell and an agenda to lie .
 although i do actually know one who &apos;s pretty honest .
 sells oni the necessary .
 told me to buy hospitalization cover enough for my kid when he was born and oni need to consider other things when he &apos;s older .
 will tell his clients to buy other company stuff and cancel his own if it &apos;s better for them even .
 maybe thats why he still oni a small agent lol
 phv/grab drivers - make an honest living through hard work .
 insurance/property agents - make money through telling modified truths .

 from pukunara to papunara
 oso see the user account friend list got someone name proxima to seem familiar name right ?
 oso look of the group  that thisperson join .
  the person flag is south africa
 this puku ever since registered in april 2021 keep praising malaysia and bashing sinkies huan .
 can report him to fica ?
 so puku is chao jhk ?
 ask him want stir go lowyat ,  not edmw
 this has now turned into a list of terms edmwers used .
 actually name-calling like ahneh (see ah-bu-neh-neh) and ahtiong can be considered as being racist if used in a derogatory tone .
 ah-bu-neh-neh has been around for decades and seriously i am not sure if it sounds racist to the indians .
 tried to find out how this name came about ,  but seems like no one knows .
 hence ,  for these terms ,  i usually indicate it as  &apos;possibly racist &apos; so people can use their common sense on whether to use it or not .
 haha ,  chiu really like this phrase hor .
 so far ,  i think chiu are the oni one i have seen using it .
 oredi planned to add it to the  &apos;+1 list &apos; .
 i know it came from  &apos;bad man forward ,  bad man pull up &apos; ,  and there &apos;s a song with the same name .
 but what does it mean exactly ,  do chiu know ?
 dont really get the african american culture .
 i thought  &apos;this thread is not simple &apos; refers to that time some minister replied &apos; it is not so simple &apos; when questioned about how the gahmen uses cpf for state investments ?
 i still dont get it .
 do chiu remember exactly the source ?
 which minister on which topic ?
 oso do chiu know which minister/mp said ,   &apos;it &apos;s an honest mistake &apos; ?
 however rich or capable he is ,  his posting is always with the blackest of heart intentions ,  no amount of money can whitewash bad character
 fair enough la .
 there is always a big difference between online and offline personality .
 broadwalk gives me the impression that he is intelligent and educated .
 be away in private jet holiday  ?
 he is playing squid game and his number is 001 .
 maybe he is the dorm owner ,  now clearing sai .
 he will come back as another clone .
 it was the kind of make no sense dream where i was wondering how he was doing and then someone start a thread to say he was one of the unvaccinated dead case and his wake is a atas place .
 serious ,  not kidding .
 nope unless if we had his taxi plate number maybe .
 cos in my dream ,  someone stated a thread abt he was one of the unvaccinated dead case and his wake is in a atas place .
 driving taxi la .
 his business picking up ,  alot of tourist from the vtl visit sinkieland
 either in hospital .
 or hp no battery
 last major activity 9th october .
 last login 13th october .
 hope he is ok .
 or he is back to his driving marathon .
 no time to chit chat here .
 dont look good
 there was a fatality involving 30 plus yesterday
 i think this means you &apos;re clairvoyant  .
 just means chiu are spending too much time here when people chiu dont even know are your friends
 he unvax can vtl meh ?
 ts ,  should we organise a party go to teban gardens all shout for him ?
 maybe still air balls @ teban gardens ?
 he jobless now right ?
 means support all the real badman .
 dunno why they ask them all to pull up .
 pull up is used by the dj during a dance to stop the music so he can say something to the audience .
 singapore disco seldom have people talking to the audience .
 but i think thai discos in golden mile should have at the end or maybe famous djs like those fatboy slim or whatever .
 it is damn common in reggae dancehall .
 even the selectors or  djs have nick names like hotta ball ,  foota hype ,  tony matterhorn .
 aiyoh what african american ?
 kena so many carribeanm people all stayin in new york ,  so many hit singers in us charts like sean paul or sean kingston .
 aiyah nm la damn funny when translate to chinese .
 kena everyone see liao all go wtf .
 eh simi mp or ministar ?
 it is the great one and oni ex pm now sm goh chok tong who said that .
 read delphi sammyboy u will know more .
 correct mah ,  pm or sm ,  both still are minister .
 do chiu still remember roughly when it was said and what &apos;s the subject about ?
 cos i like to include a  &apos;origin &apos; section with each explanation .
 he was speaking to some indians not blacks .
 they oso said pundek in the video .
 its just a joke cos they oso dunno how to explain .
 one good way to tell is how they speak and pronounce words .
 anyway jamaicans all speak engrish .
 some oso look angmo or chinese .
 but nevermind man .
 thats right but i wrote to explain that its not just any minister but the one and oni high ranking minister .
 2nd in command oni to lky .
 u have to search sammyboy for this .
 people surely will know .
 i roughly have an idea for it something to do with inflation in singapore and situation in singapore which indicate things are going worse and gct instead said more good years which obviously oni implies themselves .
 u oso mentioned about the peanut thingy in one of your posts .
 u should know how this came about right ?
 this is not oni edmw but more for all singapore poltical forums .
 is like this one
 cruising through the coffee shop now .
 by the way why not add the peanut thiny too .
 in case u dunno it came about when people were complaing abot ex nkf chief durian &apos;s salary being 600k or something liddat .
 or was it 60k ?
 so sm goh &apos;s wife commented that it was oni peanuts meaning that it amounted to very little of course to her own perspective .
  this made public backlash even worse .
 hence the term peanut is quite an oxymoron since peanuts means money of little value but in this case it is quite high .
 ps applicable oni to average or poor people .
 to mini- stars or billionairs etc it is really peanuts .
 terms which are quite funny and should have originated from sammyboy but deserve a mention here can be mini-stars aka ministers showing what  &apos;stars &apos; they are and occifers or officers mostly referring to ns army officers .
 i saw prataman mentioned quite alot too .
 it was 600k ,  if 60k she commented peanuts ,  commotion wont be that huge
 i remember irwinner started the thread is notch simple thing .
 and how about what to do ?
 whats barrel roll ?
 thats why create your own company as a backup whether there is profit or not just leave but put the infrastructure in place .
 read the article fully .
 some companies are doing that oredi .
 if we want some jobs for sinkies ,  we need to let these companies hire fts .
 they are confirm more hardworking than ceca .
 more like 97 to ceca ,  3 to sinkes !
 how is a lame excuse ?
 can chiu explain ?
 we don’t have enough talent pool .
 how many it grads do our unis produce every year ?
 tell me one mnc which has that ratio ?
 chiu just want to stir .
 why never open more slots to allow more intake ?
 token presence needed here flush through takings and pay as little tax as possible .
 power la yuguang .
 what &apos;s your edmw name here ?
 start ama thread
 trump said go back to where chiu come from !
 again ,  this analogy .
 they r not giving a level playing field on job opportunities for sinkies .
 they can hire fts but oso give sinkies equal opportunities .
 in the past we have fts with no issues ,  but after ceca was signed ,  all hell broke loose n the shyt hit the fan .
 your 50 sinkies is 45 is pr .
 5 is sc right ?
 in which out of 5 .
 4 are new citizens .
 opening statement oredi csb gao gao ,  never read on .
 at least three recruiters approach singapore-based software engineer xiao yuguang every day with job offers .
 that why uk voted brexit twice
 so ,  that’s a problem of education policy .
 but currently the fact is that we don’t have enough talent .
 either we ask these companies not to come here ,  or get more foreigners .
 no poblam ,  yeendia travel bubble coming ,  can top up talent here .
 just making up random numbers ?
 chiu have any basis for this ?
 pr population has been constant for many years .
 means more fts coming .
 as we voted for it .
 i can tell chiu very few sinkies qualified for such jobs .
 means fts incoming .
 i agree with this .
 need to give sinkies fair opportunities .
 in fact ,  sinkies should be given preference .
 but what i asked was different .
 i found the clip .
 who steal my cheese .
 wait i try upload here .
 hope the clip i uploaded here can push chiu on .
 bro stay strong .
 there are things that need to run by boss and there are things that dunnid .
 if things that need to run by boss and chiu think chiu oredi know ,  still need to run by boss .
 if no need to run by boss and ask boss then is oso ok but unnecessary
 are chiu working in an mnc ?
 based on what chiu said ,  find a better-salary job and move on .
 if chiu think you &apos;re good ,  then chiu can still prove yourself in the new company
 actually this problem even more prominent in sme .
 small company very easy to tell .
 move up very fast .
 some no luck ,  work donkey years ,  still the same title .
 quit n start own biz
 if chiu starting feel no sense of achievement ,  lagi worse no sense of belonging to the coy .
 can consider to leave this coy .
 thank chiu for sharing !
 i am glad i have taken a step to move forward  .
 shall see how it goes in the new place .
 will probably have to lie low and observe how it is the first year or so .
 what i mean is from time to time ,  have to fake  &apos;asking for help &apos; from your boss or mentor - it makes them feel good .
 i used to think if i work independently and settle everything on my own without bugging my boss ,  it will make me look good .
 turns out it makes my boss and colleagues wary of me .
 so i have learnt to swallow my pride and yi si yi si ask for advice every now and then ,  even if in reality i can probably figure how to do it on my own .
 bro ,  i was retrenched last dec .
 now oredi july ,  very tough 7 months ahead .
 learn learn and learn .
 no leave ,   oni weekend n public holiday .
 i make it a habit to recharge myself by doing jogging on sat n sun .
 i sleep early every day around 8pm .
 cos need to stay fresh .
 chiu can make it .
 that is what i do too .
 act blur n dumb .
 know but act dumb i dunno .
 if chiu are still young ,  strive hard n learn fast n dare to move up .
 haha i think i am oso getting old .
 can feel that no longer have much of the drive to climb .
 of course if somehow in the new environment ,  people are supportive then maybe i will chiong if i manage to find myself a good backer .
 otherwise just do the usual ,  take pay and focus on my investment .
 sis ,  i am oso not young anymore .
 i still have the energy to chiong ,  and i still feel that my speed of work ,  no knowledge still very much the same as i am in my 40s .
 i was being labelled as a champion in my ex company .
 but it is oni the body and mind that it is better to take things easy and less stress .
 my ex colleague told me ,  at our age ,  dont stress ,  it is not worth it at all .
 yes i agreed with sis blue ,  if your colleagues are supportive and push chiu up ,  by all means ,  give it a try never knows .
 if not ,  just work ,  and take pay and go home .
 when stating new job ?
 actually why need to swallow pride .
 asking for advice does not mean chiu dunno ,  it could be just to discuss if there is a better way to do things .
 as chiu go up the corporate ladder ,  there would be less things chiu know in detail and the more chiu need to seek inputs from others ,  so need to be comfortable with that
 how many % increment ts get in his new job ?
 in before i am from tok kong sch
 lor neng feel xia sway or nt .
 luckily he is still around .
 sit pretty earn big money and do nothing .
 does that mean lor neng is cannot ?
 that why need someone capable on top to lead ?
 waiting jamus lim to be finance minister next time
 so tharman need listen lor neng (finanace ministar) or lor neng (deputy) need listen to tharman ( overall head)
 ownself check ownself is a virtue isnt it ?
 so liddat who listen to who  .
 tharman need listen lor neng (finanace ministar) or lor neng (deputy) need listen to tharman ( overall head)
 what is lor neng ?
 ho jinx is pinky wife but still meddle with state affairs ?
 she not inside the org chart but still boss aroud
 why tharman is mas chairman and finance ministar from 2011 to 2015  ?
 no black and white .
 later sue until your gstring  ,  condom and kotex drop  .
 unless blood is thicker than water
 so many ivy league schh huan
 lor neng = braised egg
 tharman is senior minister one level up .
 finance is higher than sm
 board of directors always sit on top of the ceo what .
 i don’t understand your point of the post .
 for ts quote wrongly .
 it’s the same for every company mah no meh .
 ceo reports to board
 in before miw must make way or clear path for future prince  
 car salesman how
 phv nw is honest living .
 the route all choose by gps .
 nt like taxi driver time ,  they anyhw pick longer route to earn more .
 they say everything can claim .
 got panel doctor simi sai .
 then time to claim chut pattern say no claim .
 sign liao they become useless .
 oni repeat what underwriter tell them .
 moi look down on sinkie girl + angmo couple more
 they are working a decent ,  honest job trying to earn a living .
 never rob ,  murder or steal from others .
 why look down on them ?
 well insurancd agents actually can make a **** tonne of money .
 grab drivers have a ceiling to what they can earn
 not ceca couple ?
 look ,  do chiu look up to the bunch that visit chiu maybe once every 5 years ?
 of the one that maybe send chiu birthday greetings each year ?
 of the one that oni comes to chiu when chiu order something ?
 who earns more than chiu doesnt care if chiu look up/down on them .
 yes moreover phv is a fixed price .
 insurance everytime/everything oso cannot claim…
 nothing wrong unless they &apos;re unscrupulous selling junk cars .
 on the same topic ,  what about real estate agents ?
 shopee customer service people any1 ?
 wanna buy but cannot pay .
 i dont suppose i need to disable security for payment ?
 the ban mian cook outside they just buy seasoning powder to make the soup then throw all the ingredient inside followed by the ban mian then sell u 1 bowl $4-5 .
 u cook your own maggie mee buy all the ingredient from supermarket 1 bowl at most $2 oni .
 dunno why so many stupid idiot still buy ban mian .
 really dunno what to say
 how about people who never eat rice ?
 ok later jiak mee hoon kueh
 for almost everything sold in hawker centres ,  chiu can save half the price by cooking yourself .
 wait till chiu see people eating korean ramyeon .
 cheat my money .
 they love maggie mee
 laksa need skills and alot of money to cook the laksa  .
 wantan mee need skills to bao the wantan .
 oni ban mian no need skills no need prep work
 variety is the spice of life
 in self pwn  thread .
 ban main is not maggi mee .
 is white flour noodle .
 maggi is fried dryed yellow noodle .
 chiu cant even differentiate .
 lmao at ts stupidity
 cheena people cook thing never had skill one  ,  they just simply throw everything in and stir
 nothing much worse than cooking with rbd oils .
 what stewpig logic  .
 i think the handmade element of ban mian is good .
 the kl chilli ban mian i like but funny never see before in kl
 mean ts is kumgong dunno what he is eating
 so negative de ni
 almost the amt i would get if i were to be promoted .
 but it is nt about the money - i just want to get out of an environment which is not helping me to progress ,  if that makes sense .
 very high chance is jhk .
 he very knowledgeable about malaysia affairs .
 keep praising jhk and jhb and keep bashing sinkies , and oso keep asking to raise sinkland property prices .
 i would predict that this puku is a jhk ,  probably a pr ,  who bought sinkland property and trying to spread his foreign influence to manipulate sinkland property market .
 obviously a foreign troll right ?
 why the f create thread and attention to trolls ?
 from his/her response ,  either super troller being sarcastic about pap at the max or a hater hate sinkies to the max .
 have i ever praise malaysia alot  ?
 i praise australia more .
 threatened to report me don’t know how many times oredi .
 dont waste our mods’ precious time la pukinahia .
 oh ya chiu don’t like foul language so **** chiu and have a nice day chiu dog ****er
 no cursing please .
 no good no good .
 my hope is sinkies can improve so we can be better and more loved overseas .
 when i was living in uk and australia ,  they dont really like sinkies for whatever reason .
 then when i return to singapore ,  i know why .
 we must have a positive mindset so we make a difference in others life .
 i believe pukunara is a newly designed ai program to increase positive sentiments .
 however ,  it is a failed program with lots of own goals .
 chiu dont fake news la .
 i stay in uk and australia they friendly one leh .
 must be chiu are the problem la ,  or chiu mistaken malaysia as uk and australia .
 they are friendly on the surface oni .
 many of them stereotype foriengers .
 anwyays most importantly everyone live in harmony .
 we sinkies must welcome everyone  .
 oso not forgetting to be nice to other sinkies too .
 actually this pukunara is better than the who ah last time very annoying one pro pap one .
 mayb same people leh .
 remember all this people mentally sick one .
 i thought pukunara is lady and got daughters ?
 sagu after starting the thread calling for the society to leave the unvaccinated alone dont discriminate them then he mia liao .
 not that i support the discrimination of unvaccinated but it seems sagu and people like vanyel now kena from the side they used to support .
 songbo sagu and vanyel ?
 songbo to chiu .
 i dontch think any tom ,  dick and harry can influence the property market la .
 got so kua zang boh ?
 @pukunara please come clean
 hello my friend .
 this is not me .
 im yellow skin .

 i oredi give up eating mcd .
 prefer bk as they always have promos .
 singapore one huat gao gao .
 still can give angpow envelope
 means the actual food and photo will continue to look different
 no bonus for front line staff ,  while management staff shake leg and wfh get their high salaries and bonuses
 mcdonald &apos;s the silent killer ,   .
 the main source of all underlying conditions .
 burgers size will shrink further .
 but their price still better than those wtm ,  chicken rice ,  carrot cake ,  pranw nodle ,  bcm selling at 5 per bowl
 hope mcd in singapore close down  .
 all fos with no standards at all  .
 mos burger and bk ftw
 the mcd near moi workplace still very pack .
 everydaze the lunch need to q chao chao 15~20min one .
 thought it &apos;s franchise business .
 so owner absorb cost what .
 jiak macdonald nao
 one fof burger $5 .
 i go back to my bbfa cai png sua .
 while i am still at the coffee shop ,  will see if these phrases came from the mouth of our elites .

 but prefer to keep things within edmw cos afterall is edmw stuffs .
 oso easier for newbies to find when they search the forums .
 singapore one at suntec oso gg
 heng moi got visit this branch during tokyo trip pre-covid
 actually i have not bought anything from them as their things are too expensive !
 they will survive for another week cos i just bought a $3 eraser from there yesterday
 good for chiu ,  i planned for ikebukuro during my last tokyo trip in 2018 but it didnt materialise due to lack of time .
 will s &apos;pore one oso close .
 their things quite expensive
 tokyu hands the things are over priced ,  although there is no doubt that the things are genuinely premium quality ,  thus the high price .
 if tokyu hands now closing stores ,  i think the similar concept and pricing dondondonki may oso be closing stores .
 oni if they did one at that scale in big box .
 make jurong east great again lolol
 quite is understatement
 donki is much cheaper and they have fresh produce
 oni donki n taka is strong .
 their stuff very expensive and store so big ,  killer rental and like not much people buy ,  expected la .
 but good to browse la .
 the exact same item can get elsewhere at much cheaper price .
 that outlet is super nice to shop !
 tokyo hand people mainly go in window shopping nia how can they survive ?
 their things too ex
 retail slowly dying .
 your figures for 50 ft and 50 sinkie .
 is not random number ?
 those sgunited program graduates they employing ?
 many good courses been taken by foreign students .
 even the uni students themselves said there r many foreign students .
 uni make big buck$ from foreign students fees compare to local students with subsidized fee .
 same as why hire sinkies n have to pay cpf ,  in-camp ,  etc than foreigners .
 cb la i thought edmw say programmer 2k salary oni .
 knn where is the promised 2k salary .
 all asking 5-6k cb .
 how come got no offers
 but more balanced .
 pr population is oni 500k ,  where as citizen population is 3 .
 ep holders are oni 180k .
 sinkieland is not a tech hub to begin with .
 but we need to become that .
 finance is a stagnant industry .
 tech is growing .
 it is a tech junkyard .
 people dont want throw it  to singapore
 everyone sitting inside the aircon room ,  who are going to collect and wash your plate ?
 knn a engineering background woman can become ceo of a state owned company .
 why other without relevant skills cannot join n learn while hands on ?
  &apos;we let them in cos we require a critical mass for the sector to take off ,  while we continue to train sinkies for those jobs .
 train non stop sia .
 train for decades liao ,  until change career path to be grab and hawker
 until the day where the moolah is placed properly ,  talent will then grow .
 at least for a start .
 for most of the it jd i have seen ,  need to know the following buzz words and technology: .
 - cloud technology (few big players) .
 - cicd pipeline .
 - machine learning / ai .
 - api architecture design (securing api and throttling etc .
 - lastly  ,  programming .
 each line above is a big pie knowledge .
 if i say the following mentioned above is for 1headcount and would require experiences ,  how many dare to say have at least 5 years experiences locally ?
 so true so true
 sinkies voted for .
 which is why companies need to bring in ft .
 your elderly parents ,  aunts ,  uncles  ?
 i think he is busy .
 now all those who need to do pcr at rtc needs to book taxis or phc ,  so business booming .
 yes edmwers are all my brothers ,  lol .
 rotting in his teban gardens
 hope he comes in tonight
 think he mentioned he no longer driving taxi in oct right ?
 what is his last msg in his last post ?
 probably enjoying his holiday in germany for a few weeks
 probably made it big with his shares or casino so couldnt be bothered to be here
 he unvax ,  now no more taxi (according to him) .
 but probably busy i guess
 last seen: yesterday at 6:10 pm
 one road good walk  .
 good to know that he was last seen yesterday evening ,  must be very busy  
 wa so caring ah edmw ?
 didnt log on then got kena missed liao
 knn moi is missing @broadwalk teksi business updates liao

 maybe @broadwalk shushu finds trolling us welly bohz liao liao .
 dontch wanna troll anymore liao .
 still no update from him ?
 that uncle found new place to air his balls  
 he saud gonna stop part time taxi on oct
 @broadwalk  hello hello are chiu ok
 moi teban garden neighbour say nong time never see him outside corridor airing balls .
 maybe this time really chut daiji leow .
 where u get this from ?
 im talking about ministerial rank or cabinet ranking .
 pm ,  dpm ,  sm ,  m ,  sms ,  mos ,  sps ,  ps .
 so who is mas ceo  ?
 mean sm bigger than pm ?
 mm bigger than sm and pm ?
 mas is a money laundering scam
 thambi ravi menon
 mm lee was bigger than sm and pm .
 chairman bigger than finannce minister .
 tok kong school really is jin xia sway
 mof is not incharge of mas .
 mas is under pmo .
 that is why lw is not the top dog in mas
 mas is leelated to money and state funds=== yes or no .
 state funds and money is leelated to finance ministar ==yes or no
 dont make imsginery relationships on your own .
  fact is mas is under pmo and is seperate and nothing to do with mof .
 so lw is not their boss .
 and there is a reason mas is under pmo .
 its cause they are more important than mof
 tharman is the one who really knows the ropes in finance .
 lw is 100% clueless in finance .
 he was hastily injected into min for finance post .
 (i think) when lhl sensed something very wrong with hsk .
 it was an instant replacement .
 no slowly slowly action .
 cos situation was serious .
 up till today there has been no singapore gahment explanation of how foreign scammers can outwit and hijack the otp in a credit card scam case .
 the min fin is unable to address this in parliament .
 lw was second minister of finance when hsk was finance minister leh .
  he &apos;s not the noob chiu are making him out to be
 chiu know ministry of finance is above mas right
 iq kosong question .
  tharman si senior ministar leh .
 macam asking why lhl higher rank than finance ministar .
 this is a pofma offence
 maybe like dowager cixi ,  officially retired from her regency but effectively still leading as the head of the imperial family .
 oso the officials show respect and loyalty to her more than the emperor .
 chiu are the clueless one .
 lw was an economist in the civil service ,  ex ema ceo and principal private secretary to lhl before becoming minister .
 he is finance god
 instead of the usual mr xxx (surname) which we use to address other teachers .
 so everytime when he come class we stand to greet him  &apos;good morning sirrrrrrrr .
  &apos; then there will be this joker at the end echo  &apos; .
 maybe he ashamed of how his name sounds .
 from c ka motherland ?
 oni insecure dude did that .
 bet he is a simp
 if sinkie ,  possible is ns time want go ocs but cmi… thats why become teacher so have power over smol chewren
 i come from westwood secondary school .
 during my time (2009 to 2012) ,  we have the practice of addressing teachers as sir and mdm .
 the principle must be a boomer .
 if i principle i encourage xmms to wear short skirt and learn to ask male teachers asgm .
 last last time all must call  &apos;teacher &apos;
 now is just  &apos;cher &apos;
 he from elite school posted to your sheet hole is it ?
 i oso have a teacher insist we call her mdm ***
 sir stamford raffles .
 my army camp last time many sir are much weaker than me physically .
 when i sec school havent invaded by c ka yet .
 it was tiong or pinoy that time .
 but he was sinkie .
 i oni remember when everyone gossiped about teachers we used nicknames like dua liap ,  big backside ,  golden sack etc .
 need to “tiam” the class when he walk in ?
 last time moi elite school oso need to call cher by mdm and sir .
 come out ,  i call people mdm and sir ,  people ask me to jiak medicine .
 still better than mine .
 we need to stand up and bow to greet the teacher ,  not oni when the lesson start .
 outside classroom see them oso need .
 pay so much school fees to make our life difficult
 oso why engage contractors to renovate your house when it is proven one person alone can build a house from scratch ?
 can save tens of thousands if chiu try to do everything yourself .
 come come ,  i bring chiu bukit panjang where people literally queue 30+ minutes for a bowl of instant noodles .
 then i watch your head chiba boom 
 ts never eat maggie goreng before ?
 add extra egg ,  sedap !
 i like to eat the mhk from mr encik or something liddat .
 oni basic ingredients - dough ,  they will knead into flat pieces & put in when the stock boils ,  add minced chicken meat ,  add veggies ,  add one egg ,  and some braised mushrooms and anchovies at the end .
 very simple ,  $4 and i am willing to pay for it .
 ban mian and maggi cant even differentiate .
 heng i oni eat handmade ban mian .
 those machine made ones are not nice at all
 ban mian so nice .
 got such stall ah ?
 the ones i go to are handmade noodles .
 never see their seasoning powder ley ,  they cooked infront of customers .
 they buy cos they don’t want to cook lor ,  cooking needs time and need to prepare and wash up .
 $4-5 can save time .
 your $2 noodle so much effort and chiu never count in transport fee to buy ingredients .
 yeah ,  i remember that one .
  good times ,  good times .
 sinkies lurvs our instant noodles ,  from our days as latch key kids cos both parents work ,  to our ns days where even cold-cooked insta is better than c-rations ,  to our clubbing days  .
 even now ,  on random weekends ,  i have one for lunch macham like comfort food .
  it &apos;s even the first complete meal all my kids are taught to cook  .
 ts is a farkin ceca ft who &apos;s out to stir and belittle true blooded sinkies and their humble palette .
 ts self pawn thread
 the most stupid idiot is those who go those stupid hong kong chachanteng type restaurant buy instant noodles for $12 .
 or go those lanjiao korean restaurant buy their shimramyeon noodle for $16 .
 they just add a bit ingredient like cheese then earn gao gao profit margin lol .
 go restaurant order and pay > 2 .
 40 softdrinks even more kumgong .
 order egg one oso lol .
 or $8 for bean sprout .
 eating ban mian naooo
  lw got many fans here .
 he is obviously not in the same league as tharman .
 equivalent is ravi menon what
 lw did his tour of duty in mof before and he was mas director for a number of years before become second finance minister what .
 i think he is ok for finance .
 let’s see his first budget then
 tharman’s knowledge is too deep .
 we are safe with thatman
 he is at the right place imo
 not fan ,  just cos he is not like tharman doesnt mean he is not competent .
 pointing out his background as chiu seem clueless .
 baby vs daddy kym
 tharman is snr minister leh
 except chaly mah ,  he’s from deloitte .
 pap racist practice ?
 nothing to buy one 
 sad to see another go
 some of their stuff selling in daiso ,  can do .
 how many bbfa will support ?

 so this puki is jhk or ceca ?
 and can become prime ministar somemore .
 he got appear in genshin impact thread ,  most people play genshin ,  are weabs .
 hello parrot ,  care to share what your nick mean ?
 it is by an chance related to pukimak ?
 correction : she
 sorry i am not into vulgarities .
 my observation : he cannot read chinese words ,  which means he is either not a local chinese or belongs to other race .
 there was once he said he lived overseas for a long time ,  just came back to singapore recently .
 chiu guy go n think who he is .
 does he/she cosplay ?
 nice thread for nubs lyk mi hu just join nia .
 twmm = taiwan mei mei .
 djj = da jiejie .
 hshmm = hei se hui mei mei .
 no pang sai = chio bu and yandao is no pang sai ,  someone ask why drama the chiobu/yandao never see them pang sai one
 lol ,  so this is what cc and bcc means .
 when i saw it in that thread ,  was wondering what poster means .
  &apos;carbon copy &apos; ,   &apos;blind carbon copy &apos; .
 thx for the sic .
 eh this thread still not sticky yet ?
 perhaps they think it is more appropriate to sticky a thread abt some fugly dog
 i remember got 1  &apos;go toilet &apos; meaning go toilet to pcc right ?
 it &apos;s brb or bath room break .
 actually ,  now i am not too keen to get this stickied .
 reason being ,  let edmwish be something more exclusive to these forums .
 newbies who stayed long enough will probably stumble upon this thread sooner or later .
 (courtesy of yours truly &apos;s shameless advertising .
 the satisfying (or wtf ) feeling chiu get after knowing what something really means is quite priceless .
 ups for stick~ !
 nice lingos there .
 guys ,  come here support or +1 ,  all welcome .
 please leave your vote ,  any of the 3 opinions is fine 
 <bump> oops sorry .
 i on msn always use brb !
 must change liao 
 this is very helpful for people new to the forums  .
 now everyone will understand our secret talk  .
 cos i am a moron .
 just saw the poll results .
 wow ,  so many people voted  .
 and for the record ,  edmw has 25 morons so far   .
 hehe just kidding  
 this is useful !
 need to update le .
 broadwalk from teban garden ,  the unvaxxed ,  first ball airer ,  admirer of darkstarer and lover of big breast is gone !
 anyone can share his wake ?
 as a vassal state of india ,  cecaporians do not have a choice  
 i will sarpork jpmm & twmm .
 if he &apos;s on vacation ,  still have wifi n can connect .
 if he &apos;s in qo facility ,  still can connect .
 if in icu on respirator ,   then cannot .
 if in changi chalet ,  oso cannot .
 i hope he is ok
 he online but never post .
 unusual for him
 he joined squid games
 probably replying using his clones in this thread right now
 maybe he went and get vax
 he airballs can liao .
 i am going teban area later ,  will check the reservoir see he is there anot .
 anyone canbe trained to do the jobs available .
 whether there is a will is another matter .
 all i can say is the tax benefits for coming to singapore to do it based stuff must be enormous .
 add in mean web development .
 so is this the reason we have been importing ceca like crazy ?
 which of these roles cannot be done remotely and need physical presence here ?
 and no need apologise for anything ,  cos no one ask for it anyway .
 the crunch can be filled by cecas while sinkies serve ns ,  drive grab and deliver food .
 if a company still doesnt use ci/cd and other collaboration tools .
 chiu might be surprised .
 why this ceca name is xiao yuguang .
 want to bring in more ceca y put chn name
 i think i &apos;ve heard this line since the late 90s .
 then those multi million condos and office reits how ?
 frankly ,  if u interview ceca ,  they will say  &apos;yes ,  yes ,  i know .
 but u cant test/verify his skills cos u yourself nor anyone have the exprc since it &apos;s dam new .
 so we go back to 1st line ,  how did he knows n u didnt ?
 in singapore there are less than 3% of the pink ic population whom will qualify for such jobs .
 chiu mean sinkie got no it skills ?
 so ,  chiu agree that if we want such companies to come here ,  they will need to hire fts ?
 other options are - we ask companies to not come here .
 or wait for many years to build local talent pool ?
 no sinkie want programming .
 even ai or data science need programming .
 keyword : programming .
 it here is a joke la .
 long hours with pathetic pay .
 still have to fight ceca for a position .
 might as well join sheng siong .
 supervisor pay + bonus smelly smelly oso more than what the tech giants pay .
 they are very good at talking and selling .
 which is important cos it &apos;s the first step to get business .
 this is a skill our education system and our culture are lacking .
 if chiu ever need to deal with ceca sales staff ,  chiu will know how they can flip your words .
 if i mid career change to tech ,  what is the best course to take ?
 since there is a tech labor crunch ,  pay must be high ?
 pm me for honda / toyota lobangs hardwarezone forums app
 ya go attend one day crash course on pthyon .
 then can apply liao .
 that is what edmw promised .
 isnt this normal .
 i mean the stand and bow in class part .
 outside classroom then a bit weird .
 this just tells me this dude is damn insecure .
 need children to boost his ego  
 nb i still remember i was the  &apos;qi li &apos; ,   &apos;xing li &apos; guy    .
 recessed memories unlocked 
 normal schools during my time just stand and greet .
 oni this school then need to bow here and there
 his name was schwarzenegger ?
 difficult to pronounce la
 i remember i bow before but cant remember is pri or sec school
 sure take vaccine then tio again
 even its own citizens oso skeptical .
 not the citizens dont want la .
 the vaccines itself oso a bit short supply ,  since cn oso selling and giving out vaccines .
 ccp says sinovac this is the way .
 can we send them back the vaccine they sent us ah ?
 seems like they need it more than us ?
 just arrest anyone dont get vaccinated lor .
 so gankor meh .
 once sold ,  cannot return  chiu dunno meh ?
 moreover ship back need ownself pay .
 can we import some ccpib and line them up for shots then ?
 take one for the motherland .
 2021 first self pawn .
 can sleep well tonight .
 the hawker food is oredi so cheap .
 ban mian is not like maggie mee la .
 it is ramen that is like maggie mee .
 can save jiu save ba 
 ban mian usually handmade no ?
 might as well go 1 step further and say ramen is overpriced .
 why stop at ban mian ?
 yeah man ,  i save alot of money cooking myself ,  i work in cbd ,  so in order to finish eating my lunch within lunch hour ,  i take a cab back home ,  and then spent few minutes to cook up a meal ,  and then i take a cab back ,  real money saving strategy !
 $2 buy ingredients ,  can ts help me buy
 dunno ts is real sinkie or wannabe sinkie .
 don’t even know how ban mian looks like .
 everything u make urself at home confirm is cheaper ,  even hotpot u compare hdl and chiu buy all the ingredients make at home
 most hawker noodles are made this way what .
 others even worse ,  use soy sauce or whatever sauce  ,  even cheaper than seasoning powder .
 what do chiu mean sir  ?
 reheat the soup before pouring it over the ramen
 sorry just bu ky .
 looks like beehoon mee soup
 knn that 1 is ramen ?
 like yellow noodle
 sorry to say ,  but cqyd probably taste better
 sorry but what is cqyd ?
 disgusting like sheet
 fortunately i is tank vehicle commander ,  i don’t need to care about what my gunner thinks !
 guess from where ?
 it is lower ses than the more reputable ramen restaurants that sell tsukemen .
 i rather buyed edmw favorite cai png
 chiu operate what tank ?
 go get vaccinated ,  for your loved ones
 diam la ong i won’t be part of your experiment and kpi
 so chiu pioneer batch of 48sar ?
 this one soup base bu ky .
 i must say today’s broth was a little off .
 too much gyofun ,  i suspect .
 their broth is usually fairly consistent .
 one of my go-to local spots for tsukemen cos they don’t charge for extra noodles and today i went oomori .
 looks like pho lol .
 i am compassvale resident and the estate is getting dirty day by day ever since the town council changed hand .
 i bumped into mr ng chee meng thrice this year in sengkang area whereas the sjw mp is nowhere at sight .
 the whole sengkang degraded from first world to third’s living .
 please step down .

 this list getting longer and longer .
 today have to use 3 posts le .
 edmwish vocabulary is growing too fast .
 i always like to refer to this thread !
 still no sticky 
 this is a good thread~ upzzzz！
 what is to blame ?
 biotech failed ,  semicon failed .
 now then they realise technology is key ?
 too late liao ,  unless they invest huge in sinkies ,  which i dont see them doing .
 other than rocketing gdp ,  everything else failed ,  we are in deep shxx .
 pap had the foresight in 2006 to become an ict hub ,  launching a masterplan: .
 we have the best gahment in the world who can predict global economic trends well ahead in advance of everyone .
 as long as the senior management or hiring managers are fts ,  sinkies will lose out .
 choose the best person for the job ?
 lol ,  u go and see ,  r&d oni one sinkie out of 20 fts .
 the manager told me ,  chiu are experienced so i want u to teach him .
 i said no ,  i dont want the job liao ,  he was scholarship holder ,  so why on earth must i teach a foreign scholar ?
 he should be better than me in learning the ropes alone .
 i oso no one teach what .
 i like your comment & recommendation 
 lol after reading the sheng siong news yesterday i wondered what am i doing here .
 lol  best  comment
 all the new and future tech ,  singapore have no expertise .
 can oni leverage with low tax and cheap labour just to fight for scraps
 why our schools so lousy ?
 why ministry never project this and have more coders ?
  thought our education system world class .
  or the article is just an excuse to bring in fts .
 air travel bubble coming through
 sinkies no talent one .
 sinkies born to be bottom of talent hierarchy  .
 bo talent one la .
 we better off be chauffer and waste management talents
 it seems to me due to having to wean off fts (wuhan-19) rather than develop a singapore core for core industries the familee choose to fark us over with pathetic traineeship with pittance pay and slave like contract conditions !
 powerdah 60% chui voted for this hor dont kpkb .
 sea and bytedances is tech giants ?
 wheres is the faangs cumings ?
 moi wans to becums millionaires 
 sinkies duns codes .

 simi lanjiao noodle is that ?
 yellow noodles for prawn mee ?
 looks notch bad to jiak
 what happened to the singapore version ?
 ramen takeaway is bu ky for moi 
 does not look good
 this one is tsukemen ,  so at least the noodles won’t become soggy .
 i oni dabao tsukemen ,  not other kinds of ramen ,  specifically cos of this .
 all along those upgrades i thought was done by rheinmetall .
 they look exactly alike .
 can tell me how much chiu are paid per day ,  i want to find job ,  in need of money ,  how to apply  ?
 although i think wp is pap lite .
 but please do the honourable thing and post with your original account .
 dont be such a sneaky puppy .
 they are not performing up to expectation .
 every day pappies give birth to new dogs la
 another day ,  another ib  .
 go and marry ng chee meng la since chiu 2 have seem to have  &apos;3 smile fate &apos; .
 pay must be damn good
 but what do sengkangers expect ?
 chiu never warm the cockles of jamus heart .
 unless chiu stay here ,  else ,  chiu wont understand the current condition .
 waiting for ng chee meng holding a broom sweeping at the mentioned vicinity and  &apos;coincidentally  &apos; photo taken by the public .
 never see my pap mp anywhere unless during events .
 ts u r pathetic  !
 calvin cheng is it u ?
 did pap step down ?
 did the president step down ?
 miw convention this weekend pap ibs working doubly hard siah !
 the dog very lucky can dine out never get discriminated
 ts kena tekan into total obedience n submission 
 be happy u can see a loser mp trice .
 i haven even met my pap mp visiting my house yet .
 can’t even smell the flyer .
 how much ts paid for new sim kard to register new account to post ?
 whole of southeast asia ,  northeast asia ,  sub-continent .
 list of tributary states of cheena - wikipedia .
 full effort of sinicization .
  food names in mandarin .
  oni mandarin speakers need apply for jobs .
 apply to state administration of taxation instead of iras for an account .
  apply to ministry of hr and social security for a pension account ,  instead of cpf .
 will this be the scenario ?
 this is history ,  revisit .
 if cheena defeats us ,  chiu can be sure 99% of the world population will die oso   dunnid simi vassal states liao
 all these are secondary ,  my oni worry is their spread of socialist belief .
 next time all guys need to wear zhongshan suit ,  comb side parting .
 siao means no winne the phoon cartoon ,  no religion ,  no hwz , 
 the end of criticisms against the state and edmw .
 this kind of war got no winners ,  cheena and us oso know .
 they onli fight in the shadows ,  by hackers and try to buy other countries &apos; loyalty and show off their military power like peacock .
 if fight by military power ,  i think possibly no country can tahan all the nuclear power .
 oso mean no more music and entertainment ,  oni can listen to propaganda by ccp and speeches of xi .
 lessons on history ,  science will be tailored to ccp .
 religion banned and traditions will be cancelled .
 this is why cheena should not be allowed to rise and take over other states .
 edmwers will be employed as wumao to sing the praises of ccp
 which one more bbfa fwenly and wuhua ?
 cai png more wuhua .
 say if they mispell your name and chiu discover when they sms chiu to remind chiu to go for your 2nd vax appointment .
 at first chiu thought is typo hence never bother .
 next when chiu went for your 2nd vax appointment ,  at the counter the staff ask chiu for your ic & next print out a receipt to chiu with your name and again the name is mispell and the staff never even notice though the ic was present to her .
 till chiu inform her then she amend and reprint the reciept

 in the olden days ,  someone would have asked who did they vote for in the first page of the thread  .
 tiagong from a certain auntie that many parents want their 2-4 year old toddlers to be vaccination  .
 will it dip lower ?
 saw the keyword straittimes .
 true figure must be even lower !
 they trying to hint that the more the restrictions the lower the rating ?
 waste time doing this kind of survey .
 progression depends on the power of the people .
 fica pofma this fake survey news .

 recruiter call is to arrange interview not job offer .

 software engineering uses cicd ,  for normal retail house or non-software house dunnid cicd leh
 to those that want to change job in whatever industries ,  better do it now .
 once borders reopen ,  many jobs will go to ft .
 fangs are oredi here .
 facebook ,  google ,  microsoft ,  amazon all oredi have large offices here .
 i am not sure about netflix .
 those that can work in top tier mnc usually got satki degree .
 if u are a big mnc ,  u dare to hire those bootcamp people ?
 at most u hire 1 or 2 low level jiak liao bee for pr stunt nia .
 moe dont seem to produce tech graduates and instead still going on the old route .
 no grab then i worry .
 oni fb and ms hirings ?
 duns thinks googles hirings soft engineers  .
 noes sees amazons before toos 
 netflix oso here 
 no la - they just throw money at it problem .
 and the cecas happily accept low pay for crap job .
 crap job as in manually fixing the problem .
 - switching the system on an off again .
 - manually changing data on the system .
 - excuses and blame shifting ,  they oso do alot of praying that problem will go away on it &apos;s own (eg hoping its a intermittent network problem) .
 no coding skills required !
 the name dont even sound like locals to me .
 just import la .
 sinkie no computer engineering degree graduates ?
 can someone answer this ?
 which singapore university offer computer engineering  ?
 cecapore  &apos;world class &apos; education cannot chute out talents !
 what a waste of time ,  effort and money for all cecaporeans .
 what will prof ben leong say about this ?
 sinkies want to do accounting ,  business degrees  .
 not going to vaccinate my kids unless its compulsory .
 gahment oredi fooled us once ,  but i still see people falling for it again .
 as more of our children get vaccinated .
 we would be able to introduce booster to our children  
 sounds very familiar
 all pap mp and ministers please lead by example and vaxxed their under 12 chewren
 ban unvaxxed kiddos from shopping mall please .
 i will drag as long as possible .
 let the commandos go first
 he indirectly telling students if no vax no need go school ?
 vaccinate the low risk group ?
 unless some children are immunocompromised .
 oredi confirmed two dose is not effective against omicron and they still want to proceed .
 the oni reason to vaccinate is to hope that if infected will not be severe sick which for omicron still cannot be established due to lack of data .
 thus far ,  no children die from covid but more children die after vaccination as reported in overseas which are more transparent for such data .
 as more of our children get vaccinated ,  we would be able to see more coincidental myocarditis ,  pericarditis ,  blood clots ,  heart issues and severe adverse reactions not linked to the vaccine .
 the vaccines are very safe
 they have implemented entry to malls for vacinnated .
 they will do it for the schools
 did xiasuay chan vax his children/nephew/niece oredi ?
 please show on live video first ,  
 if next time cannot reproduce cos of the vaccine .
 chiu know why birth rate drop la .
 pap elites please go vax your offsprings gvgt gpgt then say .
 pro vaxxers parents leejoiced !
 home school instead .
 then education sector upupup
 yesterday night i saw some small flies in my house when i was heading to kitchen to take some drinks .
 my house got those electric racket those kind to kill mosquito so i go take and electrocute all the flies ,  works great though .
 out of sudden ,  a lizard just chiong out from my shoe rack then my reflex is the swipe the lizard ,  first swipe i didnt press the button so the lizard just slide near to my main door ,  wanted to shoo it out but the new hdb door the gap very small then it cannot go out so it want to run inside instead ,  then my reflex i swipe it again then i press my button and heard a tiak sound ,  i guess it kena liao .
 fly to the door again but not moving much .
 the tail oso drop out .
 then slowly i open my door and gate  ,  then swipe it far far away on the corridoor .
 the tail still moving in my house then i throw the tail away .
 didnt mean to kill it though but then just dont like lizards or insects running around in my house .
 what will chiu do if chiu see any insects or lizards running around or flying around your house  ?
 are the ats still doing orbiting ?
 liddat can steal tech from the nasa below ?
 use eye power can steal rover n drone tech below ?
 they are still very proud of their chang er .
 got atmosphere in mars ?
 anyone got the air density and gravity of mars ?
 dunno how they engineer a rc helicopter that have extremely low chance of topple over
 1% of earth atmospheric pressure at best (deep canyon on mars)  .
 less than 1% at usual places .
 38 % of earth gravity
 with mars hs little atmosphere ,   i doubt it is easy to fly .
 earth tech is build on tge assumptions that there is sufficient air in atmosphere for providing tge upward lift
 after what they have accomplished over the decades ,  this should be peanuts for them to figure out .
 angmo stole from glorious ccp dji .
 if chiu compare cheena n usa .
 cheena is way way ahead in technology n culture .
 it is laughable .
 thats cool but have they been to the moon and collect moon rocks ?
 thats the pinnacle of space exploration ok
 this is the 1st time cheena is sending a probe to mars .
 it &apos;s orbiting cos it &apos;s mapping the whole mars surface .
 angmo us oso have la .
 but they coolie genes ,  use hands to collect .
 chiu look triggered  .
 tried to kill cockroach with electric fly swatter .
 i press it against the floor ,  then i smell something and thought it died but after awhile it start to move and i end up using a ear cotton bud container to seal it n throw it away
 cockroach never die i cannot sleep

 kenasai somehow i feel my upstairs neighbour never clean the house and  rroaches sometime climb down to our windows .
 noticed a few times
 cockroach it self is very smelly sia ,  dunno kena electric will become what smell ,  those small flys i electric them got those smelly chao ta smell .

 i accidentally kena oso cannot take it .
 good inventions to kill all the buggers
 lizard i ignore .
 cockroach my baygon will come out .
 sometimes one moment see something fly inside my room ,  then next moment cannot find it  ,  then siao liao cannot sleep liao
 cockroach will use spray to destroy it .
 lizard will close one eye
 lizards are good .
 i leave lizards alone .
 some lizards damn fat sia  ,  dunno what they have been eating .
 live at higher floor oso cannot escape lizard and cockroach .
 my mum cleans the house almost daily .
 saw cockroach other day run in kitchen ,  then suddenly a lizard came out of nowhere and snatched it and drag it to under the cupboard

 singapore is first world living for many cecas
 hi patrick chiam
 less than 2 months jialat until likedat .
 and deaths hitting 10++ everyday .
 people still really dont care 
 what is really horrifying is people actually go about their daily lives more or less
 the home recovery is like 17k ?
  and more we didnt know .
  dunno y those tourists y still wan to come ?
 really virus transmission link vtl .
 give up liao and make everyone infected ?
 no test no case lor
 what do chiu suppose the citizens do .
 as if the citizens have the power to change the endemic .
 or the way this dickhead g handling thing .
 and i just waiting for the final hammer to fall .
 anyway the dead oso start from those oldies that is die-hard g supporter .
 those people in power advocating opening up is no diff from those in unit 731 .
 all in the name of science and greater good .
 2k leeported and symptomatic .
 asymptomatic not even calling in  .
 massage number too much until explode .
 they will come  .
 our official numbers going down soon .
 even though real numbers may not .
 blame ktv ,  blame unvax ,  blame indonesia fishermen lor .
 stupidity at the top echelons happened
 looking at last year &apos;s numbers ,   actually the ones discovered by serology tests after they had recovered (>98 , 000 ,  and not included in the count ) was much higher than the total reported .
 now that they are cutting out pcr tests for screening  ,  we will again see this situation: reported cases being oni a proportion of the actual numbers infected .
 either lockdown forever or suck it up and get on with life
 when the world highest paid ministers decided to package no plan as their next plan .
 just let the cases explode .
 full steam ahead in the reopening .
 it’s called the orh ee kang jinx
 blame all they want as if it will ever change anything .
 edmw has failed this city !
 heng on huat ,  happened
 normal lor ,  my nephew getting married and i weren &apos;t even invited
 liddat oso news ?
 long ting guang my gym buddy oso din invite me !
 huai is this news
 real wedding or pretend ?
 seems like same people marrying every few months .
 how is this a new ?
 his daughter long jiajia attended ?
 good ,  no need to give angpow .
 how dafug is this news worthy ?
 they would’ve all died instantly ,  vaporised on the spot by covid22 if they invited an 11th person .
 very smart virus .
 in before divorce
 good practice to just invite closest friends and relatives .
 save time  ,  save $ for everyone
 the 2 brothers look so different !
 the current version of vax not effective against omicron
 pro vaxxers will tell chiu it’s oni a small % ,  benefits outweigh risk ,  as long as it’s not their kids
 in before unvax chewren wil be banned from schools
 should not allow them to sit for psle and o level too .
 no entry into local uni .
 at the vaccination centres ,  there is a poster of activities not to do after getting the jab ,  e .
 cannot run ,  cannot do strenuous exercises .
 how do kids ,  as young as 5 year old understand the concept of no running ?
 i think ccs and sxl has kids falling under this age group
 should have waited for version 2 vaccine (delta +  omnicron + original) 3 in 1 vacine .
 remember it’s never just one dose from the look of it .
 first the chiong forward might be the data providers
 repeat of the whole process ,  kids &apos; version .
 your kid will become the outcast ,  the pariah ,  the misfit ,  the untouchable ,  .
 the one made to stand in one corner .
 coming for your kids now !
 continue be obedient and passive k ?
 so what they plan to do to those kids not going to get vaccinated ?
 do the great divide again ?
 xiasuay pap minister mai gong la knn
 maybe thats their plan all along .
 infertile or reduce sinkies pool .
 then got reason to import more ceca .
 then hold meetings to whitewash them so that they will vote for the jlb whites in every election .
 children suffer more from hfmd than covid eventually
 his children vaccinated oredi ?
 resume more learning activities = let more ceca in ?
 please trust the gahment data cos kids are dying everyday now
 please just make vaccination mandatory for all .
 i believe pap leaders will have the guts to do it
 autobots roll out   ,  why never put  ?
 what abt epic fail ?
 sianz i ask so long liao ,  no one explain .
 this is very helpful for people new to the forums .
 now everyone will understand our secret talk .
 well done everyone !

 pe = permanent ejaculation .

 this thread should sticky up !
 thx for your support !
 next time maybe can use this to teach your bb abcd .
 on 2nd thoughts ,  better not .
 dont corrupt the young generation with all these rubbish .
 154th media is oredi doing a good job .
 bookmarked this thread for future reference .
 according to singapore  &apos;business leaders &apos; ,  it &apos;s sinkie and expats coming back to singapore .
 we need to rescue them from lapeland zombie virus ,  if not against human rights .
 cargo ,  we need to import our masala spices .
 mass import cargo using passenger planes .
 i wonder how they managed to hide so many people inside the horse
 if our opposition is strong enough ,  this would not have happened .
 if our opposition is strong enough ,  we will be able to stop pap &apos;s complacency right at its spot
 1st 2 could be fws .
 last one i dunno could be pmets or prs
 the new variant is the cecapore strain  .
 ceca = covid enter changi airport .
 pay more ,  sure can find local talents .
 they want ceca la .
 ceca managers see no ceca to hire = talent crunch .
 are chiu joking sinkie oni take or have accounting business degree ?
 just employ from scholar
 we need import  .
 ok just say no talent  .
 ok village is actively
 it got so unglam that people dont want to do meh ?
 then i do logistic (warehouse) is scum of soceity ?
 it pay well in other countries but in singapore pay like coolie .
 long hours low pay ,  who want to do 
 anyone scare cockroach ?
 how to deal with it beside baygone .
 my mum bought those tau kee dried kind ,  then cook half packet and leave inside the cupboard .
 then dunno how many months never touch  ,  that day i was finding food in the cupboard then i see many flies  ,  then i finding the source then found the tau kee inside full of maggots or those small crawl worms .
 thats why still got left over flies around in the house .
 slipper or rolled up newspaper .
 normal one still ok but flying one damn er xin  ,  some hdb block near the lift every night oso got alot of cockroaches running around .
 i see liao i just kick them around like soccer
 must have moist in it .
 another maggots encounter i had was cracked rotten egg .
 ewwww jitao throw away the basket .
 lizards - chasing them away .
 cc - baygon ,  kill them at all cost .
 i hate mozzie the most .
 cannot catch them and always too late when i spot them .
 the oni time when i am able to kill them is when they have a buffet of blood and resting on the wall .
 even my electric mozzie lamb zapper did not manage to zap them .
 i buy the cockroach bait from supermarket like not much use one leh same as ant bait so expensive but like no effect one  .
 no cockroach at home but got lizard .
 whack with newspaper !
 i suck up with vacuum .
 havent decide what to do with him yet .
 boiling water works
 i use both those gel and combat bait .
 after i put i dont see them around anymore .
 and no dead ones lying ard oso .
 they probably bring back and share in the nest and all dead .
 then other insects like ants will finish them off .
 last time i tried baygon .
 just randomly spray at the drainage and pipes .
 next day will have dead cockroaches on the floor .
 but its hard to find them cause they hide v well .
 so baygon is good when u spot them oni .
 if not i use bait so they come out eat and die .
 i prefer to eradicate the whole nest rather than just killing when i see them .
 cause i cant be staying all night wait for them to come out
 the cockroach just wants to be friends 
 i like lizards .
 they eat mosquitoes which is my number 1 hated pest .
 i am terrified of lizard and won’t be able to sleep in the same room as lizard .
 will chase it away or capture with trap .
 so glad im not the oni one that spare lizards haha .
 was just joking to my family that it is our house pet .
 helps us to kill flies and spiders .
 i see cockroaches i will chase to destroy it but order lizard .
 m ,  u will see me at the other end of the roo
 alot of local giants have offices in hydrabad
 amazon ,  microsoft ,  dbs ,  grab
 the article is written by cheena and ceca .
 3 billion ceca in this planet are very famished trying to steal your lunch .
 quote by supreme leader pinky lee .
 not just local tech giants ,  globally all the tech giants have large offices in india .
 is not singapore no people .
 is the employer and culture squeeze out the ok local out .
 they want young want cheap want people life then ownself do lor
 from the looks of all the reports ,  singapore must be the most talentless country in the entire world
 lack of tech talents or cheap talent here  ?
 hope means more jobs for sinkies  
 singapore did too much outsourcing for past few years .
 now want take back ownership ,  nobody wants that pie due to old habits of outsourcing
 lai liao ,  laying the groundwork to import more
 confirm lack of talent .
 my two acquaintances fail to get in local uni com sci degree (they can get in other local uni courses but reject it) then study com sci at kaplan .
 now stay condo drive angmo brand car .
 if kaplan grad pay oso high ,  can imagine nus com sci pay much higher
 if we dont promote wfh cos of rental issues ,  sooner or later they will pull out .
 it &apos;s not cheap setting up shop in sg
 hope he is ok - maybe on holidays .
 broadwalk ,  talk to us .
 he’s dead already
 got kids liao still post edmw .
 muz be wifey dino bu or boh chap him .
 but feeling much more amplified .
 family seems oni wan your $$ .
 his wife oso another edmwer .
 so should be ok .
 i oso got kids liao still post edmw  .
 chiu dont have kids isit ?
 or did he die from complication after finally decided to take vaccination ?
 if really poor still talk liddat means he is a retarded
 tiagong got people grandfather still post on edmw
 i read  &apos;did he die from complication and finally decided to take vaccination ?
 no laaa ,  just not active
 until i see him posting ,  i am convinced he is dead .
 let me know where i can sent my bai jin .
 hmm that sounds probable ,  last i heard richiegal married somebody working in a bank but havent seen her post for a very long time .
 moi start this thread is not for people to bash him 
 chiu put up a good point .
 maybe an pai insai this forum is real
 but still no update from him
 broadwalk mia for 5 days gather more concern than many celebrities .
 maybe we can call taxi company to see if they had any taxi driver that had been uncontactable since wed and asked them to call police to check their house .
 a wp ib masquerading as pap ib trying to stir by posting ridiculous nonsense .
 they will send victor lye to sengkang
 want to flame oso provide some pics la .
 if not how to confirm ?
 based on your words ?
 very good comparison against non covid years .
 probably a jhk .
 &before under wp oso same .
 the tc manpower dont change  ,  i went to pay cc i saw the same peoples working in the town council  .
 so what the differ ?
 ts’ neighbours most likely disagree with him and will continue voting for the blues .
 ts  , chiu create crone acct just to post this kind of pappy ib thread(s)  ?
 why no dare use chiur main acct  ?
 i have seen areas within angmo kio in superbly filthy states .
 who should step down ?
 pap ib just post to earn 50c .
 go tell your master and ncm that sk will be lost forever to wp and hope the party will disintegrate in your master lifetime due to his incompetence .
 i recall some infamous hill at west side (lol .
 whole hill full of rats .
 wonder if anyone asked their mps to step down that time ?
 not surprised if so
 ts disappear liao  ?
 hi ib how much your post
 ib account approve here ah
 what happened to the internal investigation ?
  picked up bad habits .
 wish the matter will go away to survive another day .
 wp step down from sengkang grc .
 then can the same wp team come tampines grc n whip miw ?
 tampines bigger grc no ?
 tiagong wp was very shaken over ts &apos;s thread .
 wow one day later rk resign liao !
 able to create a chio bu with great body with that simple software ?
 will kena fixed or not ?
 i think shanmugam will sure suppress the anti-blacks in singapore not the anti-vaxx
 hmm it depends .
 pass jiu pass lor .
 nothing chiu all can do anyway
 wont unless you &apos;re acting by foreign influences .
 mrna came from overseas no ?
 who is an overseas organization no ?
 those who use social media to criticise the gahment for not subsidising and approving sinovac and sinopharm ,  and agitating people to protest and to pressurize the gahment to kowtow to beijing .
 these dickson wannabes must be held accoutable under fica
 these are the same who kpkb mrna while praising and kissing sinovac and sinopharm ,  to strike fear and spread rumour among sinkies ,  esp the weak ,  elderly and vulnerable .
 the measures worked but to reverse the good work at this juncture can undo all the good work thus far .
 there needs to be a cooling off period so that the hidden aka undetected cases can be nipped in the bud .
 therefore i would expect the alert to be extended until sunday the 4th of july .
 good day everyone !
 dine in for 1 or 2 pax will be allowed  .
 extend 2 weeks still ok but not 1 mth
 dine in for 1 allow so i can eat outside  
 yes ,  not asking for much .
 single diner be allowed please
 restaurant open for one pax might as well close shop go home sleep .
 aiya eat in car for another 3 weeks chiu will not lose a piece of hair .
 can eat at void deck ?
 hope we dine out forever
 eat at park lor .
 sit there slowly eat in the dark .
 to be honest i hope so too .
 dining in damn dirty .
 especially ah-bu-neh-neh food places .
 the whole place so oily .
 macam nea exempt them from cleaning .
 say until like f&b totally no business liddat .
 then how about those tour agency and places like marquee and entertainments oredi close for coming 2 years
 gahment will tell all come back office to work to increase gdp but no dine in
 yes dine out is the cleanliest way .
 no more dirty human left over waste food lying around on the tables and no birds shitting around .
 seen many people eat oredi at one corner and dump away their waste wrapped up in the bin .
 is so much cleaner
 more importantly no more birds .
 yeah ts is right .
 dine in still banned
 it &apos;s enough for me cos i go no one to eat with 
 we have to eat in toilet ?
 the press release added that phase 3 of the clinical trial of the vaccine has shown that the vaccine is safe and effective for children in this age group ,  with the expert committee on covid vaccination assessing that the benefits  &apos;far outweigh &apos; the risks .
 this makes the pfizer-biontech/comirnaty vaccine the oni vaccine approved for children aged five to 11 in singapore .
 their life ,  they decide bah… .
 when covid death announced ,  1st thing they expose is underlying conditions  .
 if they approve people with underlying .
 conditions to get jab ,  then why blame their underlying conditions  n not vaxx ?
 i ever heard one senior said that too .
 he said : old oredi ,  die  ,  die lor ,  scare what ?
 my heart thinking ,  he think covid like flu and cough .
 we are dying the moment we are born 
 vaccinated can increase the risk of gg .
 cos ,  the vaccines didnt kill normal people with no underlying conditions .
  their underlying conditions are oredi a health hazard .
 then when they tio are they going to silently accept fate or kpkb final moments cannot see children cause isolated in ward cannot breath ?
 chiu wan die chiu die yourself lor .
 just make sure never go out lo
 lol i dunno what chiu are trying to convey .
 dying for everyone is the same experience .
 are chiu trying to say that the dying experience of covid is worst than cancer ?
 if they say they are old and dying ,  whats the harm of getting vacinnated ?
 old people if after vaccine die all attribute to their underlying issue .
 no one will care for them .
 if they survive they are merely a statistic for gahment to proclaim more elderly went for vaccination .
 vaccinate to die faster .
 dont be a burden to your family .
 should use as poster motto .
 great for poor families
 who did he vote for ?
 pg thinking help pap save vax shots ?
 lolz took all the pg and mg welfare packages but dont want to help pap hitting kpi
 old people seldom go out unless there is a need like going for medical follow up else just stay at home
 save for a portion of cases that are collateral ,  the rest of the cases probably asked for it due to lack of personal hygiene practices .
  &apos;diaper masks &apos; ,  talking and crowding while unmasked ,  touching all over their face ,  eyes and mouth ,  and staying in one spot for long while unmasked (e .
 f&b) would most likely have been the reason for one getting infected .
 after all ,  if chiu go out masked up and strictly keep your mask on until chiu come back home ,  i doubt chiu would add in to become one of the daily case count numbers .
 the case fatality rate of covid fluctuates from 1-2% in many countries .
 4million population is roughly 54 , 000+ deaths .
 even if chiu give it a generous 0 .
 we &apos;re still a long way from hitting the  &apos;rightful &apos; numbers of death we should be getting .
 we gotta pump up these rookie numbers !
 u see so many still throng malls .
  even if tio oso flu nia .
 need to care simi ?
 end of wfh/stop temperature taking coincides with the uptrend spike since aug 19 as seen in the chart .
 19th aug was the date .
 the fact is the current vaccine still not effective enough and big headed oky is bekan
 very good analysis .
 oso ,  if chiu check the vaccination rates and plot that against the case count ,  chiu should oso see some very interesting correlation too !
 but then again ,  this is something that most in here wont understand .
 what is really horrifying is people are fighting over whether death cases are vax or unvax instead of why so many death per day .
 is a trap for tourist .
 let them in then test + liao then they have to pay huge med fees since they are kaijin here .
 something like “dine in” ,  “work in office” ,  all these are close contact in “aircon places” with “big groups” for “extended amount of time”…
 thats cos people here are mostly not-so-educated .
 the reason for the increasing death counts these days is simply cos the treatment protocol has not changed much since apr-2020 .
 moh is still adopting a  &apos;wait and see &apos; approach for covid patients - oni if their condition worsens then they start giving irrelevant drugs and medication like remdesivir .
 someone geykiang declared endemic .
 sinkies thought  vax means invulnerable and wont spread virus ,  went jiak lim piak .
 the rest is history .
 and it seems that while not saying out publicly but oso they are going with herd immunity liao with this strategy given that the bulk of the population is protected as best as they can oredi .
 the rest is if chiu die your taichi but they must make the gdp recover before the whole ship sinks .
 if other country move even faster to open up before us and snatch vital links away ,  it will be an even bigger longer risk in their eyes than increased deaths over a brief period .
 so what should be done ?
 the oni way can save us from miw madness is hope for other countries to mass ban us .
 maybe they will reflect
 the amazing thing is the protocol seems alright to them(those in charge) ,  simply cos other countries people die more than sg’s did per case… .
 almost as if that if other countries has higher death rate then “we are doing fine” .
 like “if other kids fail the exam terribly ,  and we fail less terribly ,  it’s ok” kind of attitude .
 so called vaccine doesnt make chiu invincible .
 personal hygiene  is key .
 simple thing like dont touch the front of yr mask so many cannot do
 it means the vaccine is working !
 please trust the science   !
 hope you &apos;re not being sarcastic .
 if chiu really must know ,  can check out the flccc protocol .
 it oso includes everyday health supplements chiu can take to boost your body &apos;s immune system .
 tried and tested supplements ,  not anyhow hantum supplements to try for fun or what .
 plus the good doctors over at flccc have  &apos;battle-tested &apos; their treatment protocols and preventive protocols back last year in 2020 when the massive wave hit the usa - unlike our local experts who talk **** on ch5/ch8/cna and say this is good that is bad etc despite not even having treated more than a handful of covid patients in icu .
 wont say more ,  later some dick come and say i spreading misinformation .
 if chiu want to be informed ,  chiu oredi got the keywords .
 endemic living +1
 songbo soon it’ll be 35 deaths a day
 we are doing fine !
 keep the polls coming in !
 help chiu dig  .
 help to vote too .

 medical exam and pregnancy test are part of the package mah ,  no ?
 unless the maid agency is a blacklisted one .
 haha return liao want new immediate maid tankuku .
 previously employer hush hush about it cos dont want pay for airfare back ?
 so sad ,  maid get pregnant ,  will lose job ,  lose face ,  get sent home ,  don’t know what will happen to the baby .
 if abortion ,  there’s health risk to the mum .
 if keep baby ,  it’s additional mouth to feed .
 how come no women charter for this lady .
 the malaysian boy friend get off scott free ?
 which agency is this .
 never test maid for preggy ?
 throw her out la .
 paid people to work end up waste money to look after the her
 the msia worker is the winner here
 haha the malaysian is the most lucky one
 if she stays and give birth then baby will be s &apos;porean and they &apos;ll be burden to the employer .
 so the best is to send her home immediately .
 one of my relative &apos;s maids oso have pregnancy problem the last time and was sent home
 the employer will lose the security bond if the maid gives birth here .
 singapore healthcare is very expensive  .
 test test a bit few thousand dollars liao  .
 i dont understand why people still gamble want to import and use fw  .
 oredi so many incidents of people kena tb .
 i wish and hope more serious incidents happen ,  then mom no choice restrict all fw coming in unless fully tested against all disease and misc effects .
 otherwise everybody just playing by chance see who kena the unlucky disease .
 the agency dont even dare to keep the pregnant maid here .
 it &apos;s against the law to allow here to give birth here be it the agency or the employer .
 mom dont give a fark to chiu all
 wanna lighten their burden turned into an added problem 
 got such things ?
 give birth here auto sinkie and not register with respective embassy ?
 citizenship by birth oni applicable if one of the parents is sinkie and legally married .
 they can get birth certificate as per regulation but that does not mean citizenship .
 the father jin song .
 the agency trying to cut corners to save costs .
 agency refuse to comment cos private matter .
 this is not private liao when it is criminal .
 did they break any manpower rules ?
 time to csi this agency and sing their name loud loud !
 babys born in singapore follow the nationality of the mum by default .
 if singapore is the case like us then everybody will flock to singapore for free citizenship for their kids liao !
 this is going to be messy
 please continue this until covid is over .
 don’t worry humans still have to eat .
 sinkies overall still need to buy food one .
 surely kena abused by some  one .
 later those ambassadors kena shouted at and threatened again like the past incident .
 definitely not allowed ,  if dining in is suspected to have caused all the clusters in the first place .
 then how i eat claypot fish head ?
 it &apos;s not the dine in ,  it &apos;s the imports 
 but semakau landfill fill up earlier then how ?
 dunno if dine in ban will be lifted .
 but very likely that ceca imports will continue bring in more delta variant
 ok i meant spread ,  not source 
 too late to blame pappy .
 the virus oredi spreading 
 if they arent paying the restaurants and hawkers etc for the non dining now  ,  then they &apos;ll open 1 week later .
 if not these shops will close
 chiu think too highly of the decision makers ,  who are wishy washy enough to allow them until another place gets hit .
 where do the birds eat these few weeks ?
 suspect allowed but limit to 2 ?
 got enough pigeon feeders to support the other birds .
 die liddat .
 no hawker center food .
 all the bird birds are dying .
 just now i saw 2 crows fighting with pigeons for leftover rice thrown out by someone downstairs .
 last time the crows eat left over hawker food .
 now they got to fight with pigeons for leftover rice .
 cook yourself bah
 this dish will be renamed .
 plastic bag fish head .
 next time your grandson ask why chiu can tell him nong nong time aghost before covid
 will be back to max 5 per table .
 they make 5 figures a month .
 if go vegetative state or prolong icu how ?
 most elderly probably dont even have insurance plan and icu stay are expensive .
 i oni know that if one got infection and is serious ,  especially lack of oxygen or difficulty breathing .
 what they think is not important ,  what &apos;s important is hitting the target of having 2/3 of population vaccinated .
 benefits outweigh the risk
 their closest kin can oni bid farewell via videocall .
 no last hug ,  no physical interaction .
 it &apos;s an awful way to say last goodbye .
 people oso keep repeating .
 srs is srs ,  need oxygen etc .
 tt is nt wrong .
 bt chiu look at the data .
 what is your own probability of getting srs case ?
 cos agonising videos of those dying from covid was never revealed to people ,  so many will just think is like dying from cancer or heart attack or like in the movies .
 the process of pain ,  breathlessness ,  lack of air in the lungs ,  trying very hard to gasp for air like drowning ,  the panic and fear they have in them ,  was never registered in their mind .
 maybe they wont can such a serious reaction ,  or maybe they do ,  it &apos;s a gamble every one of us does ,  no one knows for sure .
 complication from vaxxing is oso another unknown dimension ,  it may end their elderly lives early ,  or making it worse ,  or maybe nothing will happen ,  but i guess dying from serious covid infection is far worse and more miserable than dying from vaxx complication .
 later lie in bed with tubes coming out of nose .
 where will the son and daughter-in-law be ?
 die liao never mind .
 never die ,  and lying in bed with tubes are worst
 there &apos;s a saying .
 it &apos;s ok to die but it &apos;s not ok if you &apos;re suffering but dont die .
 then not oni chiu suffer ,  people close to chiu will oso suffer .
 then who &apos;s going to pay for your medical  ?
 wa y everyone treating it like dying from covid is a given unless u get vaccinated… really non stop sales promotion daily
 nw they pushing the narrative tt old people are uneducated .
 got irresponsible mindset .
 heck care attitude .
 their take up rate must be low until ambassadors need to go door to door to remind pioneer gen to jab .
 sinovac oso got super long q of old farts .
 nw write articles to hint hint old people dont care to doing their part .
 should ask the seniors whether they plan to bring along their children and grandchildren together to another world
 we still dont have reported case of entire singapore family die from covid .
 if patient die is they die alone .
 patient profile will be old .
 got underlying illness .
 younger people high survival chance .
 unless all their children and grandchildren got diabetes la .
 immune compromise la .
  i think can ask them your q .
 tt will be v valid .
 can drop like flies .
 i tell chiu we wont be resume 5 pax makan hor .
 ask them to put their words in writing and sign a dnr order so they dont get oxygen and end up occupying a hospital bed .
 see how many actually do it .
 he is not wrong i believe
 for older folks ,  the effects of complications vfrom vaccine are much higher .
 if they have existing medical conditions ,  the risks are even higher .
 young people will find it easier to survive the odd heart inflammation etc ,  but old folks should have different calculations .
 gahment say must vaccinate how dare him !
 in some ways yes .
  the most horrible thing about covid dying is dying alone .
 stfu is a common internet acronym right ?
 i am thinking removing the more generic acronyms .
 cos i oni reserved the 1st 3 posts .
 and is running out of space~  .
 theo is the new edison 
 we is bz collecting the 4 artefacts and seeking e 4 guardians

 this is a cumulated effort amongst edmwers over a period of .
 can i suggest that fake cheesepie be added onto the list ?
 chiu is welcome !
 cum back often n remember to vote in the polls~ 
 if they don’t report the numbers the fear will go away
 all those other countries which got delta explosion oso never returned to wuhan virus numbers
 i stopped taking lifts too
 same i stop interacting with other humans or going outside .
 scared kena covid and die .
 i do repelling down my flat .
 heng i got guardsman training .
 started with the daily delta flights .
 then the ktv pivoting fiasco ,  we never truly recovered from that .
 kpop hallyu descent
 i spray dettol in whole lift first
 oredi said before ,  ask mr ong .
 he &apos;s the one with the script .
 endemic covid strategy !
 people need to change to p*p
 cos of after highest vax rate in the world ,  garment gave false sense of safety and cause all these exploded spread and death figures .
 dangerous advice on mask part .
 chiu need to watch the video how mask restricts flow of air from chiu .
 so if someone who is infected ,  him/her wearing a mask will not spread as much virus as compared to wearing one .
 after national day cases increased by 1000 times  ,  daily death in double digit .
 singapore economy has lost another 2mths .
 instead of opening up safely and swiftly ,  now have more restrictions and less safe .
 4g not producing results .
 asked old vulnerable dont go out .
  when they focus on opening up more ,  can they bring down the number to safe level ?
 what number safe never say ?
 u dare open ,  tourist will dare come .
 just like once open ,  immediately many go book oversea ticket even to infected america .
 really stabilize at around 3k cases wor .
 pap good at controlling spread .
 totally unrelated pic: .
 dunno what fark our gahment doing .
 sincerely hope our mmtf and their families all tio and kena dismissed cos of “underlying conditions”
 but today must go out ?
 even perm ban no status nowadays if u got banned after forum migration .
 some say got strike out .
 but never saw before
 tag and auto fill the nick
 actually u all prefer banned or call out huh ?
 i prefer banned ,  quiet in the background no one know what detail happen who banned u rather than call out in the forum so paiseh 
 he went pak zham then dio tai chi ?
 i saw  &apos;banned &apos; before after migration .
 i assumed it was perm ban cos when i was temp ban ,  i did not see my status change .
 access hwz using my account if use other device still can see i online .
 if not banned i think identity exposed gao gao loh ,  i see 10 hardcore addict dissapear 9 is liddat ,  the 1 dunno what happened like k88
 that one was banned before forum migration
 everything i say oso wrong .
 this is welly shocking to know @broadwalk shushu is married with kids !
 really is troll everything for haolianing .
 example perm ban with status after migration ?
 maybe he is a foreign agent and fica has ended his mission here .
 knn edmw without @broadwalk posting is belly boring sia
 recalled this mia happened for aunty neojudy too .
 aunty judy n broadwalk related ?
 the other time he was asking for free delivery and food from brothers here if he and his parents be isolated as he said he cannot afford to pay as no income .
 the response seems negative .
 could that partly be the reason ?
 though i did tell him if he is serious ,  people will help him .
 no one care abt broadwalk any more ?
 omg it happen too suddenly
 but when u go into the hawker centre .
 it &apos;s not crowded at all .
 where chiu get the idea that all the people queuing to enter the car park ,  are doing so purely to go to the food centre ?
 are there no shops there ?
 is there no community centre there ?
 is there no mosque there ?
 are there no hdb flats there ?
 other shops down there even more no people .
 left side for visitors ,  right side for season-parking owners .
 but the left side perceptually cock-blocked ,  despite the availability of empty  &apos;white &apos; lots available from sight .
 if going to the flats or the shops around those flats ,  it’s actually alot more efficient to park at the hdb carparks 
 the lor mee at the coffeeshop is nice .
 but always cannot find carpark space ,  ended up cant go there eat .
 give up on that carpark .
 i always park opposites jalan sultan  .
 but that was last time again .
 not sure any changes there
 i not so sure if they can jiak mozzies .
 mozzies are way faster then them .
 how do chiu deal with their sai ?
 if they know to pee and poop responsibly still not that bad reh 
 lizards i &apos;ll try to  &apos;guide &apos; or sweep them out of the house gently .
 they have better luck finding food outside than in my house (my house is a natural lizard death trap cos almost no insects one) .
 roaches come in my house oso death trap .
 smack to stun them and throw them into the chute .
 the cockroach might suddenly fly into your face as u approach it .
 best is to spray insecticide from a distance
 they are silently deadly and can strike with their tongue from a distance  .
 no mozzies can escape
 manually clean up once in a while roh .
 my house hardly had ants and cockroaches problem thanks to these army of  &apos;house pets &apos; .
 small price to pay ,  if chiu ask me .
 besides ,  they tend to **** in corners or areas away from open places ,  so not too bad .
 just clean up when doing general cleaning will do .
 worse is before chiu get anything to smack  ,  it disappear then is siao liao .
 usually they run one .
 fly rarely happen .
 i once every whack the flying one with my bare hand  ,  knn they got sharp hooks on the head or leg then i kena poke .
 lucky never kena infected
 then it will continue to bug me knowing its hiding and lurking around .
 they can still attack ah
 i will post on edmw and ask people what to do .
 use what to clean ?
 but they have tiny rows of thorns on their legs .
 thats why need to use something to smack them instead .
 taught by my grandma ,  she was a shining example when it comes to killing cockroaches on sight .
 just use baby wipes
 need to scrap a bit .
 i cannot overcome my fear of touching them .
 let alone kill
 cant help chiu there .
 lucky when i yang boiboi always see my grandma smack cockroaches .
 learn from her huan .
 lizards i ignore they help to eat flies  .
 cockroach i never give face i see one kill one
 total total bs .
 what crap can indian third world universities teach that singapore universities and places like kaplan cant teach ?
 and why if they need talent and willing to pay ,  yet end up with indians ?
 where &apos;s the asians and even westerners since pay is attractive .
 especially from edb .
 what sinkie workforce complemented by foreigners ?
 we have so many it graduates and students graduating and you &apos;re telling me we have no talent for these tech companies ?
 come on ,  stop it with this bullsh*it .
 bloody fake news .
 forget about the openings .
 most will never make it through the tech interview cos they &apos;re bringing in leetcode style interview methods .
 chiu need to study 6 months just to have chance to pass the interview .
 something is seriously wrong with our education system the last 10~20 years
 is those need high qualifications one bah
 it’s just too many competition from students overseas
 serious this so high level  
 what high qualifications ?
 need to do doctorate ?
 or 3 published papers in major journals ?
 what the conclusion of this article is ,  is tech companies invest in singapore ,  wants to bring in indians .
 i really hope these indians take the money and really f these companies up until they become bankrupt
 more cecas again ?
 singapore becoming waste land .
 useless pappy leader want to find a stronger nation to get behind him .
 must well merge with bigger nation
 while some ****ing struggle to even find a job ,  some just simply gets it easily anytime .
 if unmitigated immigration by indians to singapore  ,  singapore is finished in months
 not like we dont have it grads .
 but dunno what it stuff they were told to study
 i strongly doubt it .
 what &apos;s singapore suppose to teach them but didnt but indian universities did teach their students and resulted in their students getting truckloads of money if they go back home to india ?
 its just that these people want to bring in foreigners and singapore gahment say no problem !
 obviously singapore &apos;s gahment is now at a loss on what to do .
 years of neglecting to develop our own people continues to haunt us and what they can do now is oni to keep importing and importing foreigners without any limit .
 i heard some sing gahment officials lament on the inability of singapore to produce a huawei or apple and they &apos;re now trying to play catch up .
 in the first place ,  they got the whole scheme of things wrong .
 to become great needs long period of incubation and nurturing and our gahment simply cannot tolerate that cos our scholars need instant results to gain their next promotion .
 huawei and apple got to where they are cos they have laid down a very strong foundation of developing in-house capability instead of buying solutions and labelling them as theirs ,  just like what our ste is doing .
 the sing gahment really needs to think long term !
 so now the couple got to take care the maid instead ?
 most likely transfer maid bah………
 the headline looks weird .
 seems like the baby is pregnant .
 take pregnacy test liao .
 wont get preggy after that ?
 means that maid agency can push e blame back to them
 ya previous employer diam diam about it to save airfare cost .
 bigger question is how come transfer maid need 3k
 they should have lost out the agency
 bangala song song gao bangladesh .
 edit: thanks to weaboo for pointing it out .
 it &apos;s juihu sai song song gao jb .
 i think not so clear cut .
 i am thinking of a scenario where the baby is born in singapore and abandoned .
  born in the employer &apos;s house and the maid runs away after that .
  or born in the toilet and the baby is wrapped up and put in the rubbish dump .
  and the maid runs away .
 the baby can be traced to the maid and by extension to her employer then .
  if the maid cannot be found ,  not sure if the employer or the state will assume responsibility for the child if the child is still alive .
 is jhk not bangara .
 maid agents should all go to hell
 had a similar encounter many yrs back with my parents helper .
 she was a transfer maid .
 2-3months into the job have to send her for the half yrly medical check .
 then doctor did the pregnancy test and it is positive .
 on closer check .
 doctor says she is at least 6months pregnant liao .
 cos her belly got the line liao .
 straight away send her back to agency .
 agency questioned her there .
 and she revealed she had sex with her bf just before she came over .
 throughout the 2-3months with us .
 we did notice she put on weight .
 my wife got suspect oso .
 but we just brush it off cos she eat alot .
 lesson learnt need to confirm rather than suspect .
 its a pity cos this helper quite good and is keen to learn .
 at the agency i gave her $300 as a small token .
 dunno how she is going to repay the agency as she still got another 2-3months of repayment left .
 i think mom should enforce a medical checkup after the maid is here for 2-3months .
 to pick up pregnancy that was conceived just before they come over .
 agency never chut any stunts .
 they sent her back and let us choose another transfer maid .
 no other costs involved beside another medical checkup which we insists .
 in the good old days ,  getting pregnant is a joyous occasion ,  now getting pregnant is like a sin .
 this is so true .
 just two weeks ago ,  i went for an eye check with some tests ,  $600+ .
 cos overpopulated oredi .
 nobody wants new babies unless confirmed high value baby .
 high value means parents got financial means to bring up and groom the baby until university level .
 chiu mean that mom beside got watchlist ,  oso got blacklist ?
 super eye power from pap
 the bf is peaceful follower ?
 wait the baby is pregnant ?
 the maid employment situation here is heavily skewed against the employers e .
 maid run away ,  pregnant ,  superman .
 just looking at this specific case ,  why should the employer bear the financial burden of her pregnancy (unless they are involved in the process  ) ?
 which edmw bbfa is the gold finger to this maid ?
 my son &apos;s school went through some restructuring recently and they went to change his math teacher .
 i thought they will hire someone experienced and i got a shock when my son told me they actually got a retired art teacher to teach math !
 i worry for his math grades now  his grades not doing well recently and his cohort ranking dropped from 56 to 60  i scared drop even further under this new math teacher .
 u never take umbrage ?
 dont worry ,  his math workings and graphs will be very artistic and colourful .
 can score points
 all schools are the same .
 the is no good or bad school .
 oni good or bad students .
 did chiu at least get the name ,  address ,  etc of the teacher ?
 common sense dictates that chiu do so .
 noob la ,  need depend on teacher ?
 teacher make 0 difference
 relak la ,  dont judge so early  .
 the sweeper might be the chief kungfu master ok  .
 next time he will be a champion at making power point slides .
 then go tuition .
 did the art teacher said math was easy peasy back when he was still teaching arts ?
 go find maths tutor lor so simple
 pri school very easy .
 any teacher can teach
 the art teacher must be some retired big rank from saf .
 dont worry ,  if chiur fictional son fail math .
 the teacher will harakiri
 diz iz notz az zimple theadz .
 ts’s son is sph ah .
 the teacher is kbw right .
 since your son oredi buay gan .
 even if the school get oxford professor to teach your son oso no use one
 chiu go teach if so easy ?
  syllabus get harder ,  some even goes to secondary level when compared to last time .
 this post not simpur
 back in apr 2020 ,  when people said open up cos death rate is low ,  they were laughed at .
 so now we gave money to pilots ,  dorm owners and sda for nearly 2 years for nothing ?
 chiu want cpib to investigate ?
 no test no case
 taiwan never got the delta explosion mah .
 their explosion a few months back is the uk strain .
 they got a few delta cases since then ,  but is all controlled (i .
 like cheena lor ,  we export out delta to them but with good border controls the delta didnt explode .
 no open leg policy at work
 open leg policy  .
 hee hee hee i always hear alot of those so call  &apos;boomers &apos; here who dont wear their mask and smoke near coffee shop always curse and swear at the pappies .
  but then again chiu may reason that in the end they still mark a cross next to pappies .
 or maybe their smoking build up their lung power to tahan wuhan virus
 chiu are so examplary .
 not wuhan virus prevention .
 but attaining financial  freedom .
 pap is the best
 why explosion in cases ?
 blame it on people thinking that just cos they are vaxed ,  they are immune and can do what they want .
 gahment can oni do so much .
 chiu need to go out more instead of typing countless posts in edmw .
 it &apos;s not hard to spot covidiots .
 what if 3rd boost make virus wake up and be stronger ?
 who is the minister of health back in aug ?
 play mahjong so loud sure kena one .
 singkis commit more crimes
 when seniors get sick ,  their family ,  children and grandchildren may be at risk too .
 just offer them a gaylang $100 voucher promotion of mutually benefit outcome  &apos; chiu shoot nurse ,  nurse shot you &apos; .
 sure will reach 100% vaccination rate .
 offer monetary rewards for taking the jabs .
 confirm all the seniors will rush and queue to get jab
 if kena sudden  &apos;myocarditis &apos; oso no last hug no physical interaction .
 they old and dying liao still dont leave them in peace and let them enjoy their life .
 not as if they go around spreading virus liddat .
 cos the gahment is socially irresponsible ,  and then chiu wanna deprive the citizens of their right to healthcare ?
 who built singapore ?
  without them ,  singapore is still a fishing village .
 respect your elders
 why go take vaccine .
 most of them old and cashless ,  take vaccine oredi oso cant travel .
 (i am thinking this is what they feel)
 just freebies enough .
 the old people is not wrong .
 people always think they are foolish ,  they got more years of life experience than u .
 moi corkicks all fed up regretted taken vaccines cos still cannot travel .
 their efficacy expiring fast .
 ironically they have oso survived longer than us ,  dunno y younger people giving them advice how to stay alive… dont even know if they can live as long eventually lol
 who pay their medical bill if they used up their medisave .
  it is their children .
 char siew ,  $$$ more important or life more important
 then they better sign a waiver to not get treated for covid if they kena ,  since not taking jab would cause medical resources to be overwhelmed if many of them kena
 vote for opposition .
 dont think so .
 they are old but  wiser than the young ,  dumb and brainwashed .
 old and dying  ?
 take vaccine can extend a couple of years of lifespan .
 char siew oso got small char siew to take care oso .
 the old saying ,  up got parents ,  below got wife and children .
 should take to prolong lifespan .
 better not to take vaccine ,  higher chance of extending a couple of years .
 usually flat tummy thighs oso smaller one leh

 on light and hunt it for 1 hour with my tissue paper .
 how to sleep when chiu know got cockroach .
 and i always wash my utensils before i use .
 regardless if i wash them yesterday .
 cos wont know what thing crawled over it when chiu not looking
 ikr that thought will keep bugging chiu until chiu go and hunt it down .
 lizards eat basically any insect smaller than them .
 baby cockroaches ,  maggots ,  ants ,  etc .
 thats why they get free rein to wander around my house .
 spider can oso help chiu eat small insects haha but they are insect themself too
 how bout your seasoning container ,  bread spread ,  biscuit packaging etc ?
 u will wash your hands after thouching those ?
 the pap had master plans made in early 2000s for singapore to be a digital ict economy leader .
 tell me which gahment in the world has such good foresight ?
 plans are plans .
 the gov &apos;s execution of those plans cannot make it .
 i mean screw up means screw up  .
 they either didnt do it or train 16 people when industry needs 100 , 688 .
 if they can oni supply market with 50 , 000 and these companies need 5 million ,   then how ?
 bend backwards to accommodate them ?
 if the industry cant leap 100 years in 5 years ,  then so be it
 short term greed kills .
 power struggle kills .
 pappy should have see it coming .
 please fix the issue at your doorstep 1st la .
 u go hawker center still pay by cash and coins ?
 go sit taxi pay by cash ?
 most ridiculous thing they want promote cashless payment but end up each joint got one different card .
 now oredi 2021 and other countries oredi use cashless payment .
 no need bring wallet out liao .
 not paywave by the way .
 nabei got to wait till google pay come in n centralise all payment .
 its simply cos they &apos;re not as great as they claim .
  what visionary leader nonsense
 wtf telling us to bring in more ceca .
 nx time your boss will be ceca dont say never wong chiu ,  i mean your chewren &apos;s boss are ceca and will be at their mercy
 i think we should import cecas to replace these useless dogsh*it ministers and see how they feel .
 very quickly these indians will dominate everywhere  .
 from kindergarten to schools to army ,  sinkies will be subservient to them  .
 they &apos;ll date and dump stupid sinkie women before marrying their brahmin spouses and sinkie men can inherit their sloppy seconds .
 of course sinkies will be their subordinates in the workplace  .
 the writing is on the wall .
 sinkies are really really dumb to still vote for pap when this is what is promised
 some taxis dont accept nets or credit card ,  onky cash .
 smart nation indeed .
 yes ,  this basically sums up the reasons this country is spiralling into decline .
 like what i &apos;ve mentioned ,  goh keng swee set up ste and dso with the good intention of developing in-country capability ,  but look at the state of these organisations .
 ste is good at buying overseas products and selling them as a middle man while dso is a wayang company that is oni good at show-casing their capabilities in exhibitions .
 after so many years !
 we need the likes of gks back here .
 the current political struggle is another big concern .
 im not sure after lhl left the cabinet who will be strong enough to hold the fort .
 pap sees it coming but wont do anything cos to do it means sacrificing their own interest .
 are they willing to do something that is good for the country but bad for themselves ?
 singapore tech policies may have possibly lowered to cater to the mean of asean &apos;s lessly developed economies to ensure we dont stand out too much ,  earning the ire of our neighbours .
 ceca pmets is obviously part and parcel of the agreement which lhl knows but cant control .
 in addition ,  gahment side simply just are passive and risk-averse to embrace new things .
 take a look at majority of our working environments and employers mindset lol .
 well somebody from edmw got to have the balls to write to mp about these valid points .
 what &apos;s the point ?
 theres mr kan who wrote to all the ministers in fb in brutally honest fashion .
 other than him being fixed ,  nothing will happen or even change
 the plot has oredi been revealed .
 the grandson will take over .
 its made so clear and people are still dreaming and talking about what 4g leader and who can be pm
 i can tell chiu tech interview is the hardest .
 i go for 3 interview (iq test ,  technical test ,  coding test) ,  still got face to face talk .
 super intense difficulty for every interview .
 for every interview they either pass chiu a exam paper with technical questions to answer or test chiu on alot of things .
 got 1 time i went to a ceca company to interview .
 they got 7-8 people just to interview me 1 person .
 song bo sinkies
 then how come so many indians ace the interviews ?
 and from third world country no less  .
 they must have been skipping university classes to go for indepth interview tests for years
 i believe pappy mp every receive chunk of them until mailbox sexploded .
 wp tried use kind or mean pattern explained to them nothing penetrate into pappy head .
 lky lead singapore there was good and bad .
 but ahlong leadership quality is the outcome of sinkies majority state today .
 some companies i went to interview st8 away pass chiu a exam paper and give chiu 2 hrs to complete or 1 hr .
 guess the price ?
 aiya i never say healthy good i put guess the price  
 today sticky jiak ho liao .
 zeh zeh at work cheah moi jiak thai food
 oh dear i kena tok liow $3 .
 wa free one siah  
 curry zhup - foc
 auntie no ask extra gravy one .
 i order curry vege always say no gravy .
 so even though unhealthy at least not as bad  
 never name the agency ?
 hopefully she finds the sex was worth it

 yes ,  if she is agree ,  i can tell chiu she is even more scary than anything ,  even hell .
 no ,  i am not joking here .
 i can feel like its end of the world when she is angry .
 at work ,  i dont fear of ghost .
 i  fear c boss .
 scarier than ghost .
 sinkie either bbfa or henpecked .
 so what will ts waifu do to make ts feel its end of the world ?
 she was bankrupt .

 nothing being leeported by msm yet .
 got 2 first handsource from students in the school .
 they were told to informed their tuition centres and enrichment centres that they will not be allowed to attend these classes till they are tested and cleared .
 so if they were told to do that ,  how is the news osa ?
 edgefield secondary student is unlinked covid case ,  school to conduct full home-based learning .
 all students ,  staff and external vendors of the school are required to go for a swab test .
 in before pofma ,  lock and ban
 i heard it was edgefield secondary in punggol
 this one cannot be csb else lim kopi .
 osa your head la .
 i oso tiagong
 in page 1 first .
 waiting for juicy news .
 this is a fact: the cases reported in the press release everyday lags by at least a day .
 the cases reported today were oredi confirmed yesterday ,  the cases confirmed today will oni be reported tomorrow
 no proof no talk .
 why chiu want to risk your own life to report this type of things .
 we are not living in america chiu know .
 u cannot anyhow report things like that
 few days ago there was one right ?
 the family member of the ica officer or the nurse
 clue: school is located in the north east
 virus drop from the sky .
 student last went to school on xx apr ,  showed symptoms on xx+1 apr
 no osa as the students and parents have been informed .
 no joke if student got covided .
 new india mutant virus do spread fast and kill children .
 parents need to be alert on any symptoms or non symptoms on their children .
 moe should consider school closure and stay home schooling for next 2-4 weeks to ease parents worries .
 if spread many schools ,  good luck .
 gahment should stop all maids or helpers for off days for next 2-4weeks too .
 if its true ,  its true .
 hundreds of students in the school plus parents and family will make it thousands .
 no way there can be a gag order
 so many adults kena sure got kids at home mah .
 ceca sec school ah ?
 it &apos;s not unexpected
 i laugh at all the fools who dunno what this un-simple thread is suppose to mean and get all serious on the school comments lol 
 i dont read in between meaning ?
 not in touch with latest news i would say .
 meaning all ts said is fake news .
 can close thread liao .
 your son what age first bruh .
 no time read news that dont affect moi .
 chiur school is jin funny one .
 the school medic is in charge of school security .
 the school security is in charge of education and business development .
 another school medic doing pr and media relations .
 social science doing hr and manpower planning .
 school accountant doing sociology work .
 simi lanjiao rojak school ?
 sounds worse than ite
 i understand liao !
 this thread really not simple to understand !
 thread not simpur .
 score high marks for originality ,  caught so many people off guard 
 and have a discipline master always challenge student to debate one .
 need a simpler story .
 the teacher looks like alamak uncle ?
 hear say art teacher major pe during his nie days .
 don’t umbrella me
 unless u teach kindergarten 
 this teacher got connection .
 he &apos;s a fixer mah ,  oni know how to claim credit when things go right & kept quiet when things went wrong .
 can dm moi for private tuition
 last time we got p .
 teacher teach math too ?
 then what ts going to do ,  just complain at edmw will help ?
 actually maths so easy should be able to read and learn by ownself within a day wor .
 why need teacher to teach ?
 it is just carbonated water .
 without sugar or flavor .
 can mix with soft drinks and mantain the same fizzy level .
 (if mix soft drink and tap water ,  will become flatter) .
 nice to drink but is expensive .
 costs almost $2 .
 in australia ,  sparkling water costs about the same as non-sparkling mineral water .
 whay cant sparkling water be cheaper in singapore ?
 mix with ribena nice .
 if chiu drink alot of it ,  sodastream or drinkmate can be a good investment .
 i miss the days where i can just pop by woolies and get a 1 .
 5l soda water for 70c aud .
 sparkling is same price as still water .
 but no one wants to drink carbonated water in europe .
 so wats the point of it
 dunno why people like it .
 bitter taste loh .
 dont understand why drink plain water need to be so troublesome .
 if u r thirsty enough u will drink it ,  fizzy or not .
 just use a straw and blow some bubbles into tap water and imagine drinking sparkling water
 why kombucha drink must be sparkling
 aint it  supposed to make one drink  more of it rather than to acty quench the thirst ?
 i switch to thai singha soda .
 about $16 can get 24 bottles x 325ml ,  can mix with whiskey or use for mojito .
 can get less than $2 per 1 .
 5l bottle if chiu buy by the dozen .
 the fizzy water usually will be some spring sourced mineral water
 buy soda water lor .
 almost everything is overpriced here
 tried perrier sparkling mineral water .
 satki glass bottle .
 i ever mix it with rose syrup or bandung .
 sparkling bandung quite refreshing
 mix with orange juice leh ?
 buy a soda stream machine and the gas .
 use plain water can oredi .
 get soda stream
 chiu think they lack foresight ?
 chiu guys got it wrong  .
 they oredi plan for ceca and fts to take over these jobs long long ago  .
 this is just another excuse to bring more in
 sinki oni qualify for grab & hawker academy .
 higher diploma in char kway tiao hokkien mee frying
 just curious what &apos;s the statistics of the nationalities applying  for the post chiu did ?
 ok but how come these indians do soooo well in it .
 and after they arrived in singapore they can job hop to another it company ?
 and get jobs there ?
 and and and why are these indians who ace these tests are renowned for being crap at work ?
 chiu think tech interview easy  .
 chiu go interview ,  is not face to face talk like other jobs .
 straight away throw chiu exam paper ,  after finish liao go for iq test  .
 iq test finish ,  then interviewer come to interview chiu throw chiu technical questions  .
 last they will talk to chiu and tell chiu about the company and oni here is the real face to face interview  .
 then ask chiu go home wait for news  .
 super intensive interview
 connections and ceca network  .
 just like your family members want to work .
 but sinkies need to go though all the test below i mention
 and those from talent surplus country ace all these tests and interviews ?
 the  &apos;other option &apos; is oni partly true .
 say if the company can hire 25 instead of 50 fts ,  will it always choose to leave singapore or will it restructure its operation ,  some jobs in singapore ,  some jobs overseas .
 the choice that chiu have presented is a simplified scenario to defend the ft policy .
 he talks like every country they can run to will allow a ratio of 50/50 .
 he oso talks like those countries are nice to live in and can attract really good talents .
 talking like his masters do .
 80% is indian and 20% sinkie .
 every interview i go is intensive .
 if got exam paper one at least need to spend 2 hrs on it and if lucky no exam paper oso 1 hr  .
 oso if pay not high don’t even bother to apply seriously .
 there are more money else where than this tech sector .
 one company i go got 7-8 ceca with master degree they interview me each at a time .
 i almost go crazy .
 in the end ,  they instantly offer me 2 .
 i never reject them ,  i tell them wait i consider .
 then i ignore them ,  but they keep calling me for the job
 sentiments seem similar based on my coder friends &apos; feedback from other tech ventures .
 i myself am swarmed by ceca daily at my workplace so yea the string-pulling is very real .
 to sum it up is just to justify the ceca agreement as necessary in order to fulfil manpower needs in those tech areas .
 it is no secret that tech jobs are filled up by 90% indian nationals .
 on one hand claim not enough sinkies to do those white collar jobs .
 while at the same time discouraging sinkies from taking degrees cos  &apos;university education is not for everyone &apos; in order to promote blue collar work like hawkers ,  cleaning and waste management jobs for sinkies .
 probably 7 or 8 with masters degree need chiu to do their work for them
 gahment plans depends on adoption and execution by private sector .
 plans by themselves are just hot air .
 what has happened following from the pap government &apos;s ict masterplan ?
 like east coast plan ?
 the oni way i see out of this is if our hiring managers are competent sinkies themselves .
 if they &apos;re not even good then they &apos;ll always rely on their sensing which unfortunately is easily swayed by good presentation skills .
 5k job need a panel of 8 interviewers ?
 they think hire ceo ah ?
 don’t get bullied by ceca  .
 sinkies if chiu got lowballed just reject
 cecapura oh cecapura .
 sunny island ,  sad in the c .
 doom for chiu and me  .
 chiu guys wanted this .
 many of chiu went for sheltered walkways and lift upgrades just few months ago 
 the most joking part is after the 8 people interview they asked me to wait for i think 30 minutes and they go discuss .
 come back offer me 2 .
 and tell me the other guy there oso working for 2 .
 trying to brainwash me  .
 guess what i reject and found another 4k+ job instantly
 the bag cannot support such weight one la 
 sibei retarded pose .

 why my lv hoot don’t have this

 in edmw chiu need to have some sense of humor la bro .
 omn was being sarcastic .
 get ready for yearly booster shots .
 if yearly thing ,  how many times the heart can take the inflammation ?
 sarcasm with fact is fine and i will give the thumb up .
 here have some monkeys that read and believe one .
 and these are the same people who will chiong to buy miracle cures beacause 3rd aunty &apos;s 4th uncle &apos;s daughter in law &apos;s mother say recommend .
 they should have listened to science rather than magic .
 this is the internet .
 omn sarcasm is like satire humour .
 if chiu worry people will believe tt then tt person oso cannot be helped la .
 tt person should disconnect the wifi .
 if oni they will .
 scare he tio covid never die and stay in icu taking up resources of hospital .
 side effects of mrna vaccines may kill them faster so why take the risk
 vax jangan takut ,  takut jangan vax 
 until your heart cannot take it .
 write article to shame old people for alleged ignorance ?
 if us or israel later release unfavourable findings on mrna  .
 will they write articles to apologise to old people and to shame the  &apos;expert panels &apos; by publishing their photo and job place big big ?
 either make it compulsory and take responsibilities for death or injuries .
 or diam diam since people life is people decide
 true ,  sometimes old people bo tai ji  .
 mai go disturb them .
 covid was designed to remove the weak ,  old and poor ,  it has achieved its purpose .
 i respect oni those who deserve respect .
 my statement merely shows the duplicity of people .
 sure they claim they are old and dying and do not need the vax .
 ask them to demonstrate that by puttng in writing that they will forgo covid specific treatment cos they do not need it (old and dying yes ?
 ) and they will probably sing a different tune .
 who is anyone to tell a 83 year old with diabetes to take the vaccine  ,  if it is truly not compulsory and no discrimination as promised  ?
 ts is 5 years old ?
 cannot drink plain water ?
 cos not any water will do .

 if your child suxs @ math ,  even genius come in tutor your child 1-1 in math 24/7 oso no use .

 and that charsiew of yours will come back happily to tell chiu that he managed to pwn 80 students in the math exam ranking (he suxs at math remember ?
 ) and ask chiu for a chocolate .
 correct la cos uptron ,  fake degrees from ceca and ceca unis grads take up most of the best paying white collared jobs that cecawhoreans dont want to do .
 not simple thread

 lawrence wong mus cum cream
 invoke isa to arrested ts .
 he is creating mass fear
 siao liao ts ,  i see raisin !
 waaaa steam siaaa
 i got one of these bags at home .
 later put my xmm in it
 going dentist now
 it was definitely done in jest/mockery .
 obviously a ruse setup to discourage sinkies so that they can justify adding their own people .
 it &apos;s not oni indians but pinoys do that as well .
 what warocks said somehow triggered my memory of something similar as well .
 but non-tech related .
 lol these tencent ,  bytedance(tiktok) are tiong company la .
 indian go there oso hard to communicate .
 even in shopee heard many tiong
 i think  &apos;discuss  &apos; means teabreak and eat vegetarian samosas  .
 actually i dont get it .
 what &apos;s the point of staff liddat short changing your salary .
 unless your salary is from a project budget ,  i can get it
 they purposely one .
 i ignored them they keep calling me and offering me higher and high until 2 .
 but i still reject .
 want hire be generous dont lowball until like that
 7-8 ceca bully chiu .
 and u dunno .
  they going to easily pass ceca cos same village ,  dont even need interview
 how can one sinkie work in this sort of environment where everyone else is ft ?
 how can he bury his disappointment with pap ,  and anger with the gahment in this sort of work environment ?
 maybe even pass the candidate the model answer so they can show the md or hr how  the indian graduate from cowdung university is better than even candidates from silicon valley
 not by words but by actions pap oredi indicated indians are here to stay .
 so sinkies need to accept their fates .
 look at the bright side .
 being an indian lackey is better than being a jobless man full of dignity
 wow this is the hard truth .
 ceca island ,  thanks to pinky .
 grab food grab car ,  jobs for chiu and me
 last time oredi report say will have special passes for these tech  &apos;talents &apos;
 still remember one time i applied for junior dev role at some bank ,  then interviewers all ceca .
 all ask me difficult technical questions like they hiring senior dev .
 could oni answer like 30% of them .
 at the end of the interview ,  i ask them if they are hiring for junior dev cos questions were difficult .
 they just said they looking for dev .
 didnt hear from them after that 
 regardless tiong or ceca ,  its easier for them to enter all the it companies cos they have village connections .
 sinkies will have to go through the hard route
 what have our ntu n nus been doing ?
 it all boils down to the hr ,  hiring policy of mom .
 if hr = ceca ,   ceca village will be hired .
 from his article ,  i think the guy seems to have a cheena name .
 again ,  not local .
 but then usually when u see mgmt roles many fts .
 people at the bottom oso mainly fts
 shopee is full of tiongs ,  but at least got atb
 typical ceca mo
 yup this is hard truth which pap is not able to see .
 especially in banks ,  usually 70% of employees are ceca ,  20% pinoy ,  remaining 10% are sinkies cos they are there to fill quota so that mom can close one eye .
 maybe afraid no one to take care of them if got side effect after jab .
 dont want to trouble children .
 dont forget chiu guys who were oredi jabs are the guinea pig for the vaccine .
 chiu had your jab oredi ,  so why are chiu scare that they are not vaccinated ?
 if not scare ,  why kpkb ?
 knn u young punk ,  the pg and mg generation did so much and built up the reserve ,  now u kb them
 the son and daughter in law trying to inherit money is it ?
 why must force people ?
 vaccine isnt 100% effective .
 i am not scared for myself .
 i am scared for my own vaccinated elderly relatives who interact with these antivax dumbnuts .
 humans are not rational .
 if we all think the same ,  there wont be a 61% and we wont be ranked 160 .
 funeral now cost thousands ,  oso a burden
 i hope oyk has overheard his conversation and will advice him .
 he prefer a quick death ,  not he thinks covid like flu or cough
 should organize a tour for these pg and mg to uk hospitals to witness how the old people were choking on breathing support for days before finally died .
 it &apos;s their choice ,  so why question the choice ?
 just hope that they dont spread it to others if dont want to take .
 if they die after the jab ?
 who will be responsible ?
 to those whosehs they easier to get infected .
 then chiu better go get vaccinated and do your part to get herd immunity to protect them !
 does vaccinating make chiu 100% safe from being a carrier ?
 they are making pap look bad leh
 could it be all these old people dulan cpf goal post keep changing and feels like dying anyways .
 die oredi rich and kids have their cpf and hdb to live better .
 once these 80 over year old go jab .
 can go meet their favourite idol lky liao !
 very true that these old folks do not need take vaccine since they oso not going out actively anymore .
 just let them decide and not force them
 i think they more scare no payout for family then vaccine and die 48 hours later .
 if they were vaccinated but turned out to be positive like bukit merah and were dying ,  can children visit them ?
 if they were vaccinated ,  what difference does it make if their grandchildren (too young to be vaccinated) cannot visit them anyway ?
 so they probably made their calculations .
 ask them who they vote for .
 if vote for pap should listen to pap
 if true ,  he very likely will get natural immunity ,  dunnid to vax liao .
 since day1 he say his intention is to wait for novavax ,  by the time wait finish i think he no need liao .
 thot his parents live with him ?
 wa so broadwalk is married instead of the single bbfa birgin which he claimed himself to be .
 then he realli is troll until jin big   .
 but his wifey &apos;s posts quite similar to his style lor .
 both using same same emoji de .
 why ts close thread  .
 why suddenly close  
 days without @broadwalk shushu in edmw is really boring sia
 what happen to @broadwalk
 @broadwalk realli go missing ?
 cos no point wait for sumthing cannot find .
 just like the zeroplane crashed and cannot find mean cannot find .
 after a period of time everyone must accept it .

 don’t say angmo ,  next live born as middle class chinese malaysian even better then being born as chao sinkie male slave…

 is word of mouth .
 if they dare to poftma i dare to write in to complain !
 this type of things wanna hide for what ?
 once tio must come clean and make everyone possible contact under observations !
 be more critical and decisive
 i don’t know if there is supposed to be a cut-off time for inclusion into the count of the day ,  but several weeks back i was indirectly affected by 1 confirmed case  .
 the person’s positive test result was informed to stakeholders around 12+pm ,  but was not included in the count of the day - it was in the next day’s count .
 in before ringfenced 
 preemptive and preventive measures for next 2-4weeks better than fighting fire later .
 i want singapore and people to be safe and healthy .

 i was in this thread
 where &apos;s the scool letter ?

 i have colleagues joined tik tok recently .

 after that seems like we have different narrative .
 really need votes to drop below 50% meh ?
 crunch their head .
 mass import starting again !
 they know just bluff and sayang sinkies for 2 months then can enjoy blank cheque for 5 years liao .
 rinse and repeat
 even have the cheek to say no 10 million or no 6 million .
 chiu see when new ceca join the company all immediately buddy buddy one .
 then chiu hear they from same village / city / school / college / uni .
 filipinos do the same thing too
 there are no companies which oni have local born sinkies as majority .
 i saw in linkedin that many naturalised ceca or tiong are working in govtech .
 thats why the pap understands we must be open to foreigners .
 foreigners create jobs and opportunities for sinkies ,  they benefit sinkies .
 group of ahtiong  -> all speak mandarin in weird accent .
 group of ceca -> all speak hindi .
 minority sinkie -> no one talks to them .
 we need to import more ats and cecas so that there are more jobs and opportunities for sinkies .
 what is the point of creating jobs for foreigners if it does not benefit sinkies ?
 go reserbice then people talk to u lor .
 walans need a nap now .
 when sinkies can do the job why they dont want choose
 please dont question the pap and pm lee .
 they have ministries and highly paid civil servants who have done their research and reached the conclusion that creating jobs for foreigners benefit sinkies .
 sinkies need to learn to be grateful for having one of the best governments in the world that understands that being open to foreign talent creates opportunities for sinkies ,  especially in this covid situation .
 no country comes close .
 nobody call me and my linkedin more dead than a nail .
  at least a nail has bacteria .
 go malaysia lor
 i wan to go malaysia to holiday  
 malaysia village girls any time sexier ,  cuter ,  prettier than singapore city girls !

 they will say that it is their right to go anywhere they wanted .
 they eat salt more than chiu eat rice(that &apos;s huai tio hbp and kidney problem) ,  sho chiu should not order them around .
 there are some who play the victim card and some the dying card .
 sad but very truth .
 try to entice them with cash payouts and freebies .
 2nd dose $888 plus free gifts and vouchers .
 that is the reason why my 101 year old granny never vaccinated .
 by the way she is healthy n can eat well .
 we worried the side effects
 there are at least two groups of seniors who are eligible for vaccination but have yet to be vaccinated: .
 - those who are uninformed about vaccination; and .
 - those who are well informed ,  but choose not to vaccinate for whatever reason ,  logical or otherwise .
 we are doing the first group a dis-service if we do not take extra efforts to reach out to them ,  and to encourage them to vaccinate .
 while the gahment cares about the health of all residents ,  it oso needs to think of the livelihoods of singappreans .
 like it or not ,  singapore needs to open up .
 and since there is an effective means to keep everyone safer ,  ie: vaccination ,  we cannot be held hostage by any group that has chosen not to vaccinate .
 so the gahment has sounded a warning concerning these seniors - we really hope that seniors do not form part of the covid statistic for death or serious illness .
 but if they do cos they refuse to vaccinate when they are able to ,  so be it .
 please remember that it was the choice they made .
 the elderly are just accepting fate as it is .
 to them ,  it &apos;s all god given and one must not contradict with nature .
 so said an elderly to me .
 tell them a lie ,  they will pretend to believe ,  just so to appease the speaker .
 they are just patiently waiting for their queue to cross over .
 they know they have nothing more to contribute to life and are just a burden to the younger ones .
 actually ,   those very ill old people no point give them .
 leave it to them to decide .
 dont force it down their throat .
 i actually heard a group of old people discussing this at an open area .
 these boomers should just buy a fake covid cert recognized by us .
 think u forgot to jiak your medicine again .
 either the smell or lack of proper sanitary .
 bawu too strong

 just remember to press  &apos;pause &apos; before u wake up .
 and then press  &apos;play &apos; after falling asleep .
 boomer ts never insert sd card la .

 but sometimes the save never sync with the cloud .

 then u today go back reload the saves .
 tonite u see carrie lam u go gai gai
 the more tio the merrier .
 they ownself ngeh ngeh wanna hold olympic ,  can oni laugh at them for selfpwn
 i think cos of greed ?
 cause japan could waited for so long and finally olympic will be held in japan .
 and they spent so much time ,  effort and money to get setup the venue and the world got affected by covid and they dont want to cease and want to carry on .
 now is endemic ,  can just spread ,  no problem
 chiu got follow news boh ?
 their covid situation is out of control .
 simi gold standard .
 they need to recoup the money spent .
 this is the oni reason they die die want to continue the olympic
 yep ,  money money money ,  nothing else .
 who cares about the sports ?
 that word sole means oni they can say the host country cant say **** .
 j schooling still participating meh ?
 i thought they said impossible to get covid virus ?
 i hope this can be a lesson for the singapore gahment to learn .
 it &apos;s really a bad decision to carry on olympics .
 this should have been cancelled .
 covid will hang around for the next few years .
 ya ,  even for youth olympigs .
 people complained how much vivian spent during the event .
 they missed out on how much vivian spent to get the event here in the first place .
 yeah thats one of the reason .
 oso if cancel means total loss .
 now go on ,  even if still loss ,  at least can make up a bit with broadcast fees .
 actually should be cancelled or postponed but japan is hanging on a thin thread .
 if chiu cancel ,  chiu need to compensate the actual olympic committee quite a huge sum of money ( if i am not wrong it &apos;s called clause 33 inside the olympic organizing contract) not forgetting the sponsors that threw chiu a large sum of money as well as paying all the contractors who provided svcs throughout the olympics as well as building the facilities ,  the amount of money can rack up until kisiao .
 so why the ioc oso no want to bring up about cancelling part ?
 cos of political pressure and as well as their own ego lor .
 imagine how much money the ioc earns just for olympics through broadcasting fees ?
 did any country boycott the games ?
 whatever the host makes ,  i have serious doubts they wouldnt be taking a cut .
 on top of that ,  they have their own sponsorship deals .
 another cluster in making
 one wuhan virus really give many people jialat
 can have another olympic league table on most covid tio countries after the event end .
 then parades out those gold silver and bronze medalist
 i &apos;d say the myanmar coup is an imitation of flattery as well .
 all fiat currency can be printed without any backing .
 got to check with ah sham first .
 if enough residents are interested in this ,  then the garment will open a debate ,  and probably vote for it to be included in the law .
 got to follow procedure first ,  cannot jump the gun and expect the judge to accept this as new norm .
 the judge will tell chiu what is the point of this question ?
 tell them it &apos;s an honest mistake
 1) are chiu ceca ?
 2) can chiu afford to hire pap lawyer edwin tong ?
 nope that is a money laundering crime .
 printing money is not laundering ,  its asset creation .
 say chiu want to share to more people the beauty of singapore notes design .
 singapore notes no copyright ,  so no infringement of ip if u reproduce them .
 maybe can give the counterfeit money to 250 orphans
 prison terms will still be the same .
 token of appreciation for them .
 oni if u r ceca based in mumbai
 yr note must print cecapura or cecapore .
 then maybe got chance
 are chiu holding india passport or singapore passport ?
 ceca got free trade agreement that immune them from these things .
 please look for ways to change your nationality .
 seems like the most just need to apologise and case closed .
 the judge will flatter chiu by telling chiu the jail cell is an imitation of a house .
 best reply i read today 
 the problem is whether can the seniors survive the side effects ?
 i am 40 and i took moderna .
 my arm sore for a week from 1st jab .
 my mother is 80 .
 she appears healthy but i do not know whether she ahs underlying conditions .
 what if she jabbed and passed away ?
 if she survives .
 she add a plus 1 to statistics of vaccinated senior .
 if she passed away ,  my family and i have to bear the guilt of making her take vaccine .
 my mother made her choice not to take it .
 and i accept her decision .
 my mum said that too .
 my bro in law is super obesity .
 with gout  ,  high cholesterol and high blood oso never jab .
 later suay how ?
 will he fall under underlying conditions ?
 dying from old age ,  the old folks can hope to go peacefully in their sleep .
 dying from covid is a slow death from gasping for air and basically suffocating over several weeks in icu .
 the old folks need to make an informed decision .
 cos chiu can die hard .
 like the bruce willis
 agree that it is not an easy decision and i wouldnt want to be in your position .
 the choice is hers ,  as long as we (and your mum) recognise that choosing not to be vaccinated oso carries risk - higher risk of death or serious illness from covid .
 this risk may be low (testament to how well we have managed the pandemic) but the risk *will* increase as singapore opens up .
 it is not an option for singapore to remain closed until the pandemic blows over .
 these are facts that your mum needs to be cognizant of .
 some people not jabbing is the new norm ,  just like living with wuhan is the new norm .
 pap better accept it  
 ultimately chiu jab and suay suay die next day or few days later .
 hey it is all about the underlying conditions .
 and the few of them keep repeating the same arguments .
 there is no difference in the number of heart attack or stroke cases before and after the vacccination .
 to make a difference that they cannot deny they know need how many to die or not .
 and of course provided it is not cos of  &apos;underlying conditions &apos; which almost all elderly will have .
 chiu see the young ginna-pi kena the heart problem .
 until now did they come out and say it is related or not ?
 or are they gonna push all the blame to strenuous exercise and eating supplement .
 try typing that in msn =)
 is thumbs up ah ?
 this forum oso has one .
 although ,  there &apos;s no emote shortcut for it~  .
 but why msn uses this (y) to represent  &apos;thumb up &apos;~  .
 are they trying to imply something ?
 the long promised updates is finally here~  .

 net effect is negative due to environmental cost
 depends what &apos;s your capital
 oni talk down to them by everyone ,  including sinkie bosses .
 i have a friend who is in huawei .
 guess what tiktok and huawei have in common ?
 if chiu had learn arts in uni ,  your professor will hd taught chiu enough that the local news are just spokesman for the gahment to justify their actions .
 in this article ,  they are just saying we are going to hire in more ceca
 hiring more cecas benefit sinkies .
 its true for all foreigners - everyone likes to speak in their own language .
 what’s wrong in that ?
 pap is training hawkers as the next gen of disruptors .
 yep ,  we need more local pmets .
 but until that happens ,  there is no choice but to get foreigners to support industries  .
 so u mean we had 20years head start to prepare the workforce so that we can be ict leader ,  but yet now we are saying there is a lack of singapore talent ?
 and then on the other hand india which had no such master plan ,  was able churn out  &apos;talents &apos; after  &apos;talents &apos; from the likes of uptron to  &apos;lead the world &apos; in ict ?
 ib ah ib ,  chiu are one of the failures of the education system do chiu know that ?
 instead of being gainfully employed at bytedance ,  earning 5 digits or even 6 ,  chiu are underemployed as an ib .
 im not sure about chiu but if i were doing your job i &apos;d be extremely shameful .
 propagandist/reporter/astroturfers are all disliked cos they dont represent true opinions of the people - they are oni in for the money and will sell out their countrymen for a few dollars per post .
 cheena companies dont hire ceca la .
 ceca talents ,  much needed my ass .
 to game the gdp metric ,  which is their kpi .
 yes to more uptron grads
 agree ,  cheena companies hire quality talents .
 tiktok is bytedance which is a chinese origin company .
 huawei is a chinese origin company .
 even alibaba in singapore are willing to hire chinese sinkie it specialists .
 my ex colleague is angmo  .
 for those younger entrants that did not know what happen .
 during 90s ,  early 2000/ ,   alot in fact or  most of the it roles was done by the locals  .
 it was a very different employment scenario then .
 there was a great purge of local it talents after 2000s ,  what followed after is what chiu all are seeing today  .
 this is seldom mentioned nowadays  ,  and part of forgotten history .
 chiu can ask those batch that moved to other industries what happened .
 even from then til now ,  every year without fail  ,  there is a repertoire of “lack of local talent”  .
 it is possible chiu dumb arse .
 they can simply use outsource recruitment agencies (there is no limit on how many agencies one company can use) and from there hire ceca as the headcount is not by company itself .
 and yes chiu will have that ratio .
 this is real and not csb ,  i had the same experience .
 syt ask the ahtiong out treat him eat .
 taim 2 ghost chiang mais 
 chiu switch from atb to siam bu ?
 watch videos of sexcapades nias

 ioc refused to let japan cancel the olympics .
 even though other people told him foldable bikes are allowed and the wagon is the shares the same footprint as a baby pram .
 he still continues to jjww .
 screenshot here in case he deletes it .
 this has a smaller footprint that a non foldable bike .
 then when another sensible cyclist ask him why must take train with the bike rather than cycle to the destination ,  he jjww he not fit .
 oso got a lady say the wagon is small like a pram ,  then he jjww why foldable bikes must be folded in the trains but prams no need to fold .
 this is called typical whiners simi sai pose on facebook ,  social media la .
 jjww think make himself look satki .
 actually make himself look more stupid
 the whole transport system belongs to tour de singapore !
 all shut the fxxk up !
 whoseh cannot  .
 just push in the full size bike and no one will stop you
 oni dare to talk big on fb .
 come in to scold cyclist scums .
 jjww so much oso no use .
 go complain to lta la .
 use his logic to argue with them loh .
 yes ,  how can this be allow ?
 all wheel related should be allow on public transport .
 equality for all  
 low ses problem .
 someone told him to ask lta to allow motorcycles too .
 since about same size as full size bicycles
 i saw the comments .
 really is low ses problem .
 he is arguing for the sake of it .
 another calvin cheng
 show his ugly face here come on
 actually they will .
 i was stopped when i wanted to push my foldable bike to the platform without folding it .
 i explained what it is easier to push it to the platform unfolded and that i will fold before i board the train to no avail .
 i compiled without complaint since i can understand their fear that people will just go into the train without folding the bikes .
 so now before i enter the gantry ,  i fold the bike .
 a bit harder to push folded but still manageable so no big deal .
 why foldie allow but my 100cc small scooter not allow .
 mrt please come clean
 scum on road ,  scum on walkway ,  now even want to be scum on mrt .
 really true that true de singapore tend to be certain character .
 knn ,  liddat called not fit ?
 and why must he ride train with the bicycle if hes not going to cycle it ?
 really scum until cannot scum ,  and all these cyclists still wonder why people have such a low opinion of them
 we are oni half way to 5 , 000 cases
 increases by 4 .
 solving ageing population ,  one at a time .
 plus the 8 deaths today ,  total increase is 12 .
 6% of beds empty ,  dont worry
 how sure are u they got check into icu ?
 unvaxxed truly are crippling the medical system  
 gahment lose the gamble ,  sinkie and hcw have to suffer
 can the death rate for this 1 month  match the total amount we had last year ?
 the 8 who died no longer needed the icu .
 no issue clear some old stock
 more people in danger of losing their lives
 soon moh will change the data to lump booster jab vs partially vaccinated .
 looked like 8 died were from the one requiring oxygen , 
 icu cases going up fast .
 u cannot do that .
 unless it was created by ceca in cecaland .
 u better dont play with such things .
 your level in this society right ?
 u r like the food  .
 everyone else feeds on
 just tell the judge that u made the currency before sang nila utama spotted the lion
 then honggan liao lor 
 sinkie dont anyhow play play later judge rekt u like what the others have said 
 tell the judge chiu got the fire in your belly .
 judge will concur with your view that imitation is the best form of flattery but this act that chiu have done satisfied all the ingredients listed in an offence under the singapore penal code .
 he empathize with chiu but has no choice but to sentence chiu .
 but he will tell chiu that it is criminality ,  and will send chiu to changi for eternity .
 for singapore &apos;s continued prosperity .
 got use one or not ?
 anyone get back to chiu ?
 or have to go down to police station more efficient 
 i got use before .
 and yes they will respond .
 roughly how long after the report did that take ?
 after a very long time ,  uefa have decided to reurn back to 3 european tournaments starting from next season .
 at first ,  they abolish the  &apos;cup winners cup &apos; ,  and then they merge  &apos;intertoto cup with uefa cup &apos; and call it  &apos;europa league &apos; ,  and now they introduce a third-tier  &apos;conference league &apos; .
 manchester city - champions league group .
 manchester utd - champions league group .
 leicester - champions league group .
 chelsea - champions league group .
 west ham - europa league group .
 tottenham - europa league group .
 liverpool - conference league playoff
 one of chelski or citeh will win the cl and will qualify for next season cl as champion .
 1 more uefa cup space will open up no ?
 1st champion of the conference league 2021-2022 .
 dont think it works that way .
 wow sound like an exciting league to play in !
 the fourth-placed team will play in the europa league group stage instead of the champions league group stage if chelsea wins the 2020–21 uefa champions league and manchester united win the 2020–21 uefa europa league ,  and both winners finish in fifth place or lower .
 liverpool fans prefer they finish 12th than go into any of those crappy uefa leagues
 better than super league
 gxgx to liverpool .
 enjoy being the biggest club in conference league .
 and it will be so embarrassed if they dont win this league .
 what about the so-called esl aka the  &apos;european super league &apos; ?
 can become the first team to win uefa europa conference league in 2021-2022 ,  and book a spot in the uefa europa league in 2022-2023
 fsg will be murdered if this happens
 ey where is arsenal ?
 even the club world cup is so much better than the so-called super league
 we are discussing if it finishes like what ts has stated no ?
 if chiu want to bring in all the permutations ,  everton oso still can get 4th .
 got trashed by their former manager unai emery in the europa semi final last night
 so u saying liverpool fans would prefer to go as lowly as 12th and not even aiming for a top 4 spot ,  let alone 1st place ?
 where &apos;s the zhup  ?
 cl winners are in by default .
 each country will oni have max 4 teams in cl ,  so if chelsea or city win the cl ,  they will enter with 3 others teams .
 so the country will be allocated another european spot in the eu cup .
 oni guys got fetish .

 u neber include mat ?
 they will come clean and tell us not to panic as the close contacts has oredi been quarantined when they want to lol
 if true ,  the best question we should ask is when is cb 2 .
 0 oredi what .
 community case until school sia .
 last year got student tio ?
 thats what i thought too
 got one ri boy .
 aiya last year oso got student in school tio right .
 end up oso nothing big de  .
 everything ok ok 1 la .
 virus scared pap ,  dontch need worry
 last time oso got student tio then they very confident say no risk of transmission right ?
 this time so serious swab whole school ?
 depends on the strain and how infectious .
 this time indian variant more easily spread
 the student was last in school on 29 apr 2021 .
 students and staff who have been in close contact with the student have been put on quarantine order (qo) since the morning of 1 may 2021   .
 p/s: please wait for an official annoucement  
 wait for tomorrow news and see what happen
 seems more deadly too
 means the whole class got quarantine ?
 looking at the track record they take at least 1 week to identify .
 youd expect the whole thing to be automated by now right lol
 oso harms younger people
 their news always very slow de .
 it &apos;s like they want to wait until cannot cover up oredi then report lol
 who the student get the virus from ?
 those living in punggol will they oso get affected ?
 no worry ,  pap change tactic .
 this should have been the way mah since last year .
 but now new strain can oredi hide from the test ,  too late liao .
 one year can earn three years of money tsmc engineers posted year-end bonus: 14 salary + 2 .
 5 million bonus-tsmc ,  bonus-fast technology (driver &apos;s home media)-technology changes the future - gamingsym .
 as the world’s largest and most advanced wafer foundry ,  tsmc’s revenue is more than half of the industry ,  and its gross profit margin exceeds50%if chiu [ .
 according to him ,  tsmc has fixed14salary , this year his department performed very well ,  so he posted5performance bonus for the second quarter ,  each time more than50ten thousand taiwan dollars (approximately11 .
 5ten thousand yuan) ,  the whole year is14monthly salary+250million bonuses .
 judging from the situation of others ,  the performance bonus exceeds5times are not guaranteed ,  but14monthly salary+200the annual reward of 10 , 000 taiwan dollars is still commonplace .
 as long as chiu are willing to explode in tsmc , it’s ok to make two or three years of money in a year .
 as singkeeland focus on gig job ,  taiwanese tsmc engineers get 36mth bonus average
 sinkies specialise in peasant jobs like food delivery ,  phv
 ah gong with great foresight for taxpayer say can buy chips cheaper from taiwan so why dont we leave that to them and we jusy buy .
 should be everybody
 sinkie boss give chiu aws bonus oredi talk until sky going to fall liao
 tsmc not easy to work in .
 u think to earn the 36 months bonus the engineer’s life shorten by how many years ?
 did chiu read who is author ?
 do chiu have any data to back up that life was shortened ?
 so chiu think grab food driver scrapping by few dollars is very easy ?
 it is a knowledge based industry ,  there are many engineers in taiwan  who took pride in doing their jobs .
 hsinchu property were bought up by tsmc engineers
 ns train sinkie men to be physically fit ,  obey instructions ,  and be punctual in meeting deadlines .
 these jobs are perfect for sinkie men .
 foreigners create good jobs for sinkies .
 please pardon the author .
 his brain is damaged from drinking pee and eating poop 
  &apos;not easy to work in &apos; based on what ?
 they are easily the strongest corporate entity in tw .
 dont mix tsmc up with sinkie smes owned by ball licking papie dogs
 the intellectual requirement is very intense .
  even the best may need to put in more than 12hrs per day .
 its ceca business engrish
 singapore used to have no .
 3 wafer fab in world but give it all up
 and who gave it up ?
 none other than the self-righteous arrogant know-it-all boomer papies who oso spat on creative
 i think not give up ,  just that tsmc had a better or more aggressive strategy that gave it more advantage over chartered semi .
 cant remember the exact details though .
 imo ,  i just think singapore went in too late for the semi game .
 dont tok cok la .
 chiu worked in there before ?
 or chiu think tw kias cannot take hardship ?
 talk as if chiu are ex tsmc .
 the engrish lik fuk .
 5 million bonus = 3 years  ?
 means 1 year salary oni 1 .
 means total noa last year 150k sgd .
 lol ,  good programmers easily earn that amount yearly .
 dont have to wait for bonuses .
 did indranee signal is our spf beh kah ?
 or lazy need tt to catch criminal ?
 if no other data available ?
 tt is amulet and armour all in one .
 vivian deserves 1 year bonus !
 indranee said what huh
 on why nnp is big .
 since when spf eh kan ?
 spf run fastest when little india riots
 highly paid but useless .
 meanwhile ,  cecas just get the jobs solely cos they are cecas ,  their own people .
 ceca was replacing locals in it even 10 years back .
 this was why i chose to pursue other degree instead .
 looking at all these sinkies in this thread fighting each other over nothing ,  no wonder ceca can pawn us so easily ,  just suck it up gais
 my friend is a chinese sinkie .
 young grads now chiong to take comp sci plus importing ,  few years later will saturate and pay drop .
 nowadays when i work with other it staff at client side or techies at vendor side ,  being able to speak to anyone with a local sinkie accent is more difficult than an andy lau amongst edmw bbfas .
 this one i agree  ,  my linkedin like got job offer every other day even when i set not looking out for job
 haha of course there will be pro ceca in this thread .
 some sinkie chinese will benefit from ceca ,  it &apos;s not all gloom and doom  .
 but i can see there are more negatives for sinkie white collar who have to compete directly against them .
 ai etc emerging will face this situation meh ?
 anyway best is to pursue own interest ba ,  if not work oso everyday not happy .
 it is precisely cos ceca is able to churn out so many talents even from 3rd tier education institutes just shows how much talent ceca has .
 singapore opening doors to ceca will benefit sinkies .
 ceca talents being rejected in other countries will come to singapore and improve the lives of sinkies .
 wrong ,  few years later 90% of tech industry will be populated with ceca and sinkies have to bow to them and set their salary requirements below them
 ceca will become their manager even though they are same age 
 will we see this kind of signs next time ?
 the part on outsourcing practice is true ,  even in reputable mncs .
 the head count for perm staff is low ,  hence can drive down the project costing .
 the project can have 50 ,  60 or even 100 people working on it ,  but if oni 10 are not outsourced ,  costing oni include the 10 .
 but whether can or will hire ceca or not depends on the hiring company .
 its oredi happening ,  male sinkie graduate at 26 from  &apos;prestigious &apos; uni come out work with ceca who oredi have 5 years of exp at 26 and probably earning much more than him  .
 as hiring manager ,  which want would u want to hire ?
 true ,  out of all my vendor support ,  oni one guy is born and bred sinkie .
 others are all at ,  pinoys or ceca .
 it is possible to request for specific ceca as long the hiring company got the source .
 if u work in cs or ministry offices ,  100% will have locals bred sinkies but working environment wont be better
 nb i &apos;ve been getting alot of useless ads like this on my screen lately .
 censored the bloody website name cos i do not want to lead any traffic to their fugging website   .
 experts all eating lunch ?
 full size bike cannot fold
 i wonder if the hours on the saddle restricted the amount of blood going into his brain .
 i think mrt should set rule to ban all foldable bicycles ,  personal mobility vehicles at least for rush hour .
 male karen spotted
 went to amsterdam and all kind of bicycles are allowed in their metro .
 but oni at specific compartment and the whole cabin has no seats at all .
 ok ,  tell smrt and lta to jitao blanket ban all bicycles on board mrt .
 just cos this cockenathan like to jjww .
 whole lot kena .
 just like ns time .
 he wan to behave like guniang recruit ,  jjww here and there ?
 never mind ,  whole lot get it .
 want to hoot ,  find this guniang and hoot him for jjww-ing .
 tiagong sitting on the saddle too long puts pressure on the lan pa ji and make u impotent .
 thats why u dont see cyclists with dua lan pa and lanjiao like an anaconda that was just fed 20 tigers .
 want cycle just go la .
 take what mrt ?
 got money hire a cab drive bike home lor .
 pests getting annoying each day  
 cyclists are just karens in spandex .
 he should get this lor since hes not fit .
 sounds like a typical 39% .
 gotch ask him who he voted for ?
 chiu just tell him ,  if we allowed his bike in ,  next up will be the motorcyclist will complain why full sized bicycle allowed but motorbike not allowed ?
 that  &apos;wagon &apos; looks quite gd for supermarket/market use than those foldable metal trolleys .
 where its wheels really can give way after months of use  .
 this topic is abt that cyclist huh .
 as per topic ,  if normal bicycles were to be allowed on board trains/buses  .
 imagine the chaos if bucketloads of such riders were to bring them onboard theirs 
 amsterdam has a strong cycling culture and the cyclist has better manners than this david
 can imagine by the time of actual competition ,  oni 2 contestants cos all the rest disqualified due to covid .
 ^ easy gold and silver for the remaining 2 .
 on a serious note .
 haiz sports more important than lives meh .
 the jitpun naysayers equivalent to edmw bbfas oredi warn and warn .
 they still proceed !
 wa havent start ,  oredi piak ?
 not they die die wanna recoup what they oredi spent to host this fked up game ?
 wa nangz bbfa wont understood huanz larr .
 olympic scale superspreader
 yeah just waiting for the olympic variant to be imported here .
 then should be gg liao .
 considering the athletes are so fit plus got vaccination oredi .
 this mutant should be way stronger than delta
 whao lao ,  later under scope ,  the virus look like olympic logo .
 north korea lor they dont want participate
 plot twist: japan didnt fork up the 25b to continue .
 other countries begged japan to continue by donating undertable money .
 no one cares lol
 hwait til atheletes cum back then care then kpkb lohh .
 standby for official announcement
 those world class top athletes wont be there one
 means die die must oso go ahead ,  at least got chance to earn back .
 no live audience but bulk is tv revenues anyway
 now singapore oso covid deep deep
 i suspect japan dont wish to stage but behind been force to .
 japan always put their people first .
 is not about money .
 japan is not poor country even they lose so much still put their people interest first as alot japanese protest gahment to stage it .
 euro cup there probably spread like wildfire oredi .
 ordinary japanese force their gahment to stage it ?
 no leh ,  most reports are saying japs at angry at their gahment for staging it .
 knn  ,  when is our turn  .
 our neibor have oredi started opening up their nightlife ,  clubs ,  discos etc  .
 ours still imposing restrictions here and there ,  does pappy really know the meaning of  &apos;endemic living &apos; notch  .
 angmo cuntries lagi best ,  can open big big rock concerts all people grind each other macam there &apos;s no cobid liao  .
 and yet here ,  even want go makan oso very mafan  .
 subjected to sho many simi lanjiao  &apos;new normal &apos; rules and restrictions/inconveniences ,  and if chiu unvax lagi worst kena discriminated cunt even enjoy a simple basic pleasure of having chiur piping hot food anymore on the f&b premises .
 nb  ,  whack rk and wp jin song and  &apos;take own sweet time &apos; to dig all their dirt but never bother to expedite the opening up of our nightlife till sho many uplorry  .
 other place can start see their djs shake again their ( o ) ( o ) liao  ,  yet here we can oni still  &apos;shake &apos; ourselves  .
 it &apos;s time to shake the karchng
 we still gotch too many restrictions imposed by the pappy ,  like macam never ending  .
 other places oredi re-start shaking their booties and held large-scale public events eg .
 gaming ,  sports ,  carshows etc  .
 wait long long ,  this guy no doesnt look like a clubber .
 stats dont tell the full story .
 if people observe other people around dying from covid ,  no need for restriction .
 everyone will auto lock ourselves at home .
 but thats not what &apos;s happening .
 thats why chiu still see masses gathering at every opportunity .
 if u still cant see the truth ,  chiu are blind
 sinkies love getting locked down in prison state and told exactly what to do by daddy pappie  .
 that’s why whole lot obsessed with doing national slavery as well .
 in any another country ,  non of this orwellian bs will stand with the citizenry
 they die no enuff people yet .
 wait omicron wack them one more time .
 pap still havent resume their physical meet-the-people sessions yet .
 what does that tell us ?
 that chiu are  &apos;blind &apos; .
 can never convince people until their own lives are affected .
 chiu can carry on fearing that your life is being threatened by this virus .
 fear fear fear .
 continue locking yourself at home
 people open pub and ktv covid number continue to reduce .
 sinkies sneak into pub and ktv immediately  .
 they scared tio cobid ,  notch they scared ppl/residents tio cobid  .
 lock down oso wrong .
 dont lock down oso wrong  .
 edmw jin demands
 listening to dj playing songs at bigo now ,  mentioned that some of their djs have started returning back to work at clubs ,  ktvs ,  pubs etc  .
 looks like they really have open up their nightlife ,  entertainment scene  .
 how cum our media never report this ,  dont dare ah  .
 think jade can do her healthcare work forever liao ,  no chance can return  to her dj work here  .
 means their cases possible under reported
 edmwers will ask if coloured wave open bo ?
 he can sing and dance
 mathematically it doesnt look good for vaccinated tbh   i vaxxed arh
 dont worry ,  they have oredi prepared for it .
 the situation is worrying
 remember when icu was oni 5 people every day ?
 80% of people are vaxed ,  but make up 50% of those who need need oxygen and above  .
 20% of people unvaxed but make up 50% of those who need need oxygen and above  .
 imagine if lesser people vax ?
 absolute numbers will increase right ?
 were they in icu ?
 we wont hit 5k ,  the population will split to dorms/young/old and then oni the old people numbers will be reported in main headline .
 once a person requires oxygen tank to breathe  ,  i think it is oredi considered quite dangerous .
 especially for old people who are less likely to heal their lungs .
 that 197 severe cases and 34 icu ,  even if survive oso most likely suffer from long term adverse effect which includes organ failure such as kidney failure .
 misery wont end with covid one .
 they lumped pv and uv together .
   how u know this group make up mostly of uv or pv ?
 now got how many pv ?
 so small its insignificant i bet .
 whats wrong with that ?
 its been shown that for delta ,  pv is not very different from unvaxxed .
 easier to just see fully vaxed vs others .
 thats oso beside the point right ?
 the stats clearly shows vax got impact and it works ,  which is a point chiu completely sidestepped
 as of 12pm on sep .
 29 ,  1 , 335 covid cases are currently warded in hospital .
 most are well and under observation .
 there are currently 197 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation ,  and 34 are in critical condition in the icu .
 of those who have fallen very ill ,  192 are seniors above 60 years .
 over the last 28 days ,  98 .
 1 percent of local cases were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms .
 419 cases required oxygen supplementation and 52 had been in the icu .
 3 per cent were fully vaccinated and 49 .
 7 per cent were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated .
 36 have died ,  of whom 30 .
 6 per cent were fully vaccinated and 69 .
 4 per cent were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated .
 8 more covid deaths as s &apos;pore reports 2 , 268 new cases on sep .
 the total number of covid cases reported in singapore is now 94 , 043 .
 the real  &apos;unvaccinated &apos; (people who dont want to vaccinate) is alot lower than 20% .
 minus children ,  thats around 10% .
 minus those who cant take any vaccines (mmr vaccination rate for example is oni 95%) means that we &apos;re looking at 5-10% unvax oni .
 now the complication is whether these people who died could have been vaccinated or not .
 some really cannot one ,  will even have exemption .
 if they kena ,  really cant be helped with the vaccination situation ,  they just cannot .
 they &apos;re part of the group that herd immunity is supposed to protect .
 it seems that people have forgotten that the purpose of herd immunity is that some people cannot be directly protected .
 so getting people to vax is correct .
 saying that there &apos;s this big group of people who stubbornly dont want to vax ,  thats not correct .
 then way are vax in the hospital oso ?
 many more still dont worry
 in before mr bean gif
 chiu are right in your points ,  but when did i say theres a big group stubbornly dont want to vax ?
   i just said vax helps ,  and if 80% of people who vaxed didnt vax ,  then we would be in big trouble
 situation looks fairly bleak .
 if chiu account for high % of unvax who are elderly ,  who are clearly of higher risk ,  then in reality there is not much difference
 dont understand  .
 can u rephrase ?
 be careful ,  u might end up playing with her kukujiao instead of heart .
 many will be played by her .
 then commit suicide .
 even lb oso chiong ar  
 wana play with her boobs and pigu dong 
 i will whore-heartedly play with her .
 i love big breasts !
 look very firm .
 too hard for moi 
 i want to merry her heart
 i will feel the hearts .
 that is not what i said .
 do chiu understand what are the lowly uefa competitions ?
 if chiu dont let me make it more obvious .
 europa and conference league playoff .
 it &apos;s champions league or nothing .
 and frankly champions league wont happen for them .
 no ,  west ham and tottenham will take the europa slots ,  and liverpool will still take the conference slot .
 ucl will still be city ,  united ,  leicester ,  chelsea .
 west ham will oni qualify for ucl if they finish 4th and chelsea doesnt win ucl .
 it wont affect 6-7th place at all .
 if west ham is 4th and chelsea wins ucl ,  west ham will still go europa .
 2-1 is considered trash ?
 man u winning the eu cup and chelsea/man c winning the ucl ,  will change how the slots open up .
 there was a year when even the 8th spot team entered the eu cup .
 anyway chiu can dont believe me ,  chiu can wait till soccernet do up a permutations table .
 what he said is correct la .
 if champions league have 4 engrish teams ,  then europa league will have 3 engrish teams .
 if champions league have 5 engrish teams ,  then europa league will have 2 engrish teams .
 they got quota one .
 and regarding your statement whereby the 8th placed team qualify ,  that one is exception cos they qualify via the fifa fair play ranking which has since been abolished many years ago .
 chiu mean 1 more slot for england in europa league ?
 they paid the price for buying a cb that klopp is not fielded since he is bought in jan .
 they want to cheapskate so they will get the cheaper league .
 fsg is not going to sell lfc so the fans are stuck with them whether they like it or not .
 this is the hard truth .
 i would think it &apos;s fair to give a country more spots if the country &apos;s clubs win both the ucl and the eu cup .
 that means the standard of the clubs in this country is high and should be duly awarded more spots .
 i would be surprised if the rules dont put this into account .
 anyway ,  who wants to watch some san marino club playing right ?
 edmw people are so knowledgeable .
 i think the fans will not take it especially if this pushes klopp to not extend .
 not just davies ,  even tsimikas never play .
 when chelsea won the champions league title in 2012 ,  the 4th-placed team tottenham got dumped out from the champions league .
 @senna wales @drkcynic
 arsenal fans must be glad they are in bottom half of the league  .
 knocked out by the manager they sacked .
 lmao u can wait long long for your  &apos;wish &apos; to come true ,  it will oni happen when elephants start to fly 
 related to this ts ?
 got a call from my employer to do swab test tonight before 11pm .
 good luck ts hope u are ok   
 ya tiagong india deaths got all ages one

 unlink means anywhere oso can get liao .
 allow more cecas to fly in import cases end up need to qurantine sinkeis haha
 camping here for breaking .
 ts ready to go cantonment cafe for some kopi ?

 i feel that gahment should cb 2 .
 0 instead of waiting for results cos i oredi suspect got cases liao in singapore  .
 hopefully they make fast decisions .
 the virus strain test so long ?
 think young adults not kids
 first time im actually posting that .
 more importantly is when he had the virus .
 if for days before 29 apr ,  gg liao
 chiu careful hor .
 not doubting what chiu say but this is singapore .
 don’t later bo tai boji kena from them
 i think by tonight should know if it &apos;s true .
 just now in the mrt ,  i saw a pg pulled down his mask and sneezed openly .
 a flat piece of coarse fabric or other material used for wiping one &apos;s shoes or feet ,  or in various other forms as a floor covering .
 a small flat piece of decorated material placed under a lamp ,  dish of food ,  or other object .
 sports a floor pad to protect athletes ,  as in wrestling or gymnastics .
 a densely woven or thickly tangled mass: a mat of hair .
 the solid part of a lace design .
 a heavy woven net of rope or wire cable placed over a blasting site to keep debris from scattering .
 upz for u ,  very helpful .
 kumsia berry the muchie~  .
 upz for a coooold sunday morleng~  .
 good for yeah  .
 what is fp over here ?
 oic , ic ,  thank chiu very muchie .
 chiu is welcum~  .
 cum sarpork often~ 
 huai didnt add  &apos;piak piak &apos;  ?
 cum sic sic more often~ 
 thank chiu hor .
 what is bnp ah  ?
 been shopping around in the market place eh ?
 bnp should be  &apos;buy now price &apos;~
 up this thread .
 very useful to those new to edmw .
 oh i see ,  thank chiu for replying .
 they currently still in the top half .
 just 5 points seperate them and the conference playoffs 
 engrish teams now very strong
 according to the article ,  the rules changed in 2013 .
 that means if chelsea gets 5th & wins ucl ,  west ham will still go ucl if they &apos;re 4th .
 same as 2 seasons ago if chelsea gets top 4 and win ucl just like they won europa ,   they will go ucl and if west ham gets 5th ,  they wont go ucl .
 top 4 guarantees ucl spot unless both winners of ucl and europa ended up 5th and below .
 then 4th will end up europa and 2 winners will be in ucl .
 cos uefa gives england a maximum of 5 slots provided the winners of ucl or europa is from england & winners are not in top 4 .
 if engrish clubs didnt win the competitions then england will get 4 slots in ucl only
 simply cos of the tv money .
 ever since tv money came in ,  even the small clubs ended up in list of richest football clubs  .
 with more money ,  it means better players and manager .
 it doesnt mean engrish football is  a better type of football
 we have global foundries in sinkieland tiobo ?
 even get paid 3 years every yr is still very low
 cannot say liddat .
 u must see the cost of living in taiwan .

 standard of living so low ,  must go big cities for proper shopping .

 lol 50k in taipei oni can afford a normal apartment .
 chiu think taiwan cheap ah ?
 covid aside ,  singapore is literally 1-3 hours flight from some of the best beaches and nature in the world .
 so i dunno what chiu talking about
 a train company can be run to the ground for short term profit maximization .

 1st world cuntry with 3rd world labor law .
 13mth is not mandatory !
 i listened to the cleaner aunties talking whether to have the 13 and sounded so excited ,  me heart aches… .
 fark the politicians when they enjoy the swiss standard of living ,  have they ever think about the citizens when they sipping their tea ?
 this kind of website chiu all believe ?
 u go work in micron or global foundries in singapore first then imagine how much more tough it is to survive in tsmc…  .
 those who can survive to take bonus there probably really deserve it…
 my base salary oredi $2 .
 4m twd a year and i work with relaxed mood at 79 .
 engineer is for the average to do
 another victim of creative writing ,  at the time csm ,  there are oni a few foundries … being no 3 is  actually saying chiu are at the bottom
 tw taichi all come to singapore forum to jjww for f sia .
 5 pb for 2nd quarter .
 not even end of the year yet .
 anyway taiwan no need get out can go to beach le .
 singapore focus on cut cost ,  cheap and fast labour instead of retaining workers .
 thats why we cannot succeed in long run .
 cant come faster noeugh
 shut up la u and your suay mouth
 cb one whole year is the best
 it is inevitable .
 just waiting for cny to blame people for whatever made-up nonsense .
 come what may~~
 those who without jobs want the economy to get better .
 those who got jobs wanna wfh ftw .
 crow mouth leh ts
 so far so good .
 can call this ccb  ?
 most likely cb after cny .
 good i am ready
 ts ,  get it into your thick skull .
 singapore will never have cb anymore .
 we have defeated covid and we are the gold standard to do so .
 pap champions of the world !
 pray hard for cb again 
 yes ,  cant wait for hotel staycation again .
 this time will be sure to stock up bath salt for use with the bathtub .
 teh oni thing sinkies can thank ceca is if cb comes again lol
 lol ,  my uni angmo phd lecturer was younger than me .
 girls were swooning all over him ,  guys just shake head asking why same age but status so much different .
 no ,  naturalised citizens are oredi working inside .
 chiu can hear different accents oredi .
 but then why is our gahment encouraging sinkie to be hawkers ?
 ceca has further separation into their own mother tongue or dialects if im not wrong .
 ceca will never mingle across all ceca .
 they have their own distinct groups .
 they hire tiong new citizens or tiongs wholesale .
 maybe a few locals at low level positions .
 just see sea and garena reviews chiu will know .
 sinkies &apos; view is that outsiders ,  esp angmo ,  are always better .
 if chiu have an angmo and a sinkie both pitching their products ,  the angmo one will always win .
 years of colonialism have moulded our mindset .
 more jobs for foreigners will benefit sinkies .
 singapore core actually refers to everyone .
 which part of it chiu didnt understand ?
 i think we need election every 2 years to keep pap on their toes .
 i say oredi vote smart guys  .
 software engineer came from india and got covid
 preparing the populace or in military terms preparing the battlespace
 how much do chiu get paid if chiu know all these things ?
 why no talent after upakill 20 years
 we got vinyl bar ,  relax
 super league almost happened .
 maybe elephants are starting to lift off .
 yes u are right .
 this current rule started from 2012 when those within the spurs camp including their fans were not happy that their team were denied a place into the champions league after finishing in top-4 .
 same goes to the istanbul 2005 where liverpool won the cup but finish below 4th placed everton ,  and merseyside fans in those era were embroiled in this saga .
 that one is entirely different which might or might not happen .
 but your  &apos;wish &apos; is not wanting san marino clubs to participate which is totally impossible cos uefa wants a fair pyramid system whereby all clubs in europe will be given a chance .
 at the moment with their current form ,  if this still continues ,  they will made it to the champions league oni if they win those lowly uefa competitions aka europa via conference .
 top 4 confirm into cl la .
 oni a 5th slot if cl or el winner is outside of top 4 .
 that was arsenal’s hope but no more liao .
 so chelsea has 2 chances .
 top 4 or win cl .
 others like west ham ,  pool ,  spurs and everton can oni qualify for cl via top4 .
 means  &apos;creative accounting &apos; .
 lets look at it this way .
  vax oni helps when u r in hospital .
   how many vaxxed vs unvaxxed got the virus in absolute no .
  out of these thousands now in hospitals which group is the one that needs more help ?
 now it seems like the vax gave the vaxxed a huge sense of security that is aiding the fast spread
   catch no ball
 i see pro vaxxers losers trying to justify their belief haha idiot
 thought in icu is more critical condition than requiring oxygen ?
 they are grasping at straw liao cos they feel dumb dumb to be duped
 soon there will be fully vax vs single booster vs double booster vs triple boosters
 weeding existing citizens for new shitizens .
 34 icu is new record .
 previous record was 32 on 10 apr 2020
 big pool of ppls can be dumb still congregate at the malls and coffee shops .
 cant blame them they dont read news or read edmw
   vaxxed liao dunnid scared .
   y cannot congregate ?
 cheena shuns singapore ,  us oso shuns singapore .
 which country will be next ?
  &apos;how many vaxed vs unvaxed got virus &apos; -->  .
 chiu will never know .
 if chiu are vaxed ,  chiu are likely to be asymptotic .
 you &apos;re oni counted in cases if chiu got a positive test ,   but chiu wont take a test if chiu feel fine or forced to right ?
 so vases are undercounted .
 helps in hospital is the point right ?
 chiu dont overwhelm medical resources so the hospital got capacity for chiu incase chiu need it .
  &apos;now it seems like the vax gave the vaxxed a huge sense of security that is aiding the fast spread &apos;  .
 i dont get your insistence on blaming the vaxed or what your point is lol .
 if chiu feel fine ,  will chiu restrict your activities ?
 they should keep cases low and not leave it as it is ,  u never know how the virus will mutate with large numbers infected .
 bring kids run about in the mall ,  let them walk n jiak mcdonald fries at the same time ,  carry one infant without mask here shop there shop .
 i am certain that the gahment has implanted in these peepo a very good sense of security .
 got pap is no worry
 interesting how severe the situation currently is with more variants compared to last year &apos;s outbreak where we would oredi be in dorson orange .
 now we &apos;re instead opening up .
 i m not blaming the vaxxed .
   the vaxxed r the ones who r finger pointing at the unvaxxed for crippling the system .
  u r entitled to your opinion i m entitled to mine .
   lets end it here
 pure stupid and they are probably citizen somemore .
 dont understand why some sinkies(maybe not) can be so kum ah ?
 they were told vax won’t get serious covid effects .
 yes their locals protest against to stage due to covi19 .
 i see is japan been force by behind .
 those people behind force them to stage .
 i think they got no choice but to proceed  ?
 moi oso think is veli unlike nihon usual style .
 they need to cancel ndp too .
 might have cluster .
 winners easier to win this year  ?
 how to place bet that games will be a huge failure ?
 these international organizations like ioc la who la .
 who gave them mandate to ignore individual countries &apos; rights ?
 just cos they were appointed by the global powers means every other country must fall in line ?
 will ioc take responsibility in the event of a covid surge in tokyo ?
 yup ,  chiu oso seem to notice that this is not japan style .
 behind been force to stage .
 japan do things always put their people first .
 halimah made the right choice - good luck to our athletes .
 she’ll probably clapping for they while dipping istana cookies in milo peng
 notch style oso llst liaoz hwen $$$$$$$$$$$$$ cum in pikture .
 nowsadays siami oso $$$$$$$$$$$$ 1st ,  boh gumzeng gong huanz marr !
 at least the japanese like others usa ,  etc will vote out those cannot make unlike us here in singapore .
 what talking chiu ?
 is we dont have balls to vote out pap despite know they are not capable unlike the old pap .
 whereas other countries their people will vote out any party cannot make it during their terms .
 eat panadol first .
 too bad ,  jp had spent alot of money on this olympic games .
 so ,  die die has to go on .
 just like our singapore gahment has invested alot on the jewel changi airport .
 so ,  die die has to reopen .
 technically ,  shouldn &apos;t this be the most high-stakes olympics during modern times ?
 increased chance to die for eternal glory and fame lol .
 tiagong japan oredi fked up long ago .
 just hiding numbers cos olympics comign .
 nah ,  japan dont bother losing money as i have mention they always put their locals interest first at least when come external  ,  foreigner pressure .
 but this different .
 partly is a world sporting event .
 i still feel they are been force this time must do .
 if i not mistaken japan hold dont do due at first due covi19 wide spread .
 they cant copy partly oso need to handle olympic games on the same time .
 olympic games is not like other sporting event .
 in fact need more man power  ,  resources more than staging world cup .
 i just wanna know ,  those that opted for class a or b1 and then subsequent treatments at specialist .
 how much less they paying under new system？cos i dont agree with the subsidising after they opted to upgrade their wards .
 peasants ,  just lan lan stay at c to get the subsidies .
 im peasant by the way .
 there are no more details on the types of subsidies .
 i expect straits times to do a better job .
 tbh ,  nowadays c ward oso got air con .
 oni scare is got screamer besides u .
 a ward very creepy imo .
 i was in b ward ,  the uker in my same ward died that morning .
 srsly if in a ward ,  i will chui sai at nite
 heart bypass still oni $8 ?
 i thought oni b2 and c has subsidy ?
 don’t think a ward has any subsidy .
 b1 may have very small subsidy ,  and this is 4 in 1 ward .
 b1 is best got 4 beds
 totally no details ,  just some simplistic info graphics is treating people as fools
 rich people stays in mount e and raffles where got time to go public hospital
 wa good money .
 this shows how much tsmc is overcharging its customers !
 chiu work in micron or tsmc before ?
 how do chiu know tsmc worse than micron ?
 please dont share such news ,  sinkies oni interested in phv ,  sda and food delivery jobs
 their 36months bonus is not easy to earn hor .
 u think like sinkieland civil servant .
 teabreak ,  seminars ,  wfh  .
 theirs really is everyday ot  ,  find it hard to take leave type .
 and really must be at top of the game .
 all the apple ,  amd ,  nvidias depend on them
 likely where he work have no sites in taiwan so he transfer germany instead ?
 go army carry field pack is training for the food panda bag
 our hcw oso everyday ot 2 years find hard to take leave leh
 in before the same people say .
 sheng siong more xiong than ntuc thats why bonus higher
 which job easy to earn ?
 silver serpent oso pai tan .
  oni ministar and mayors easy .
 if tsmc dont pay ,  all their workers will be head hunted .
 so tsmc is paying a ransom $$$ to survive .
 actually nowadays is all knowledge based economy .
  the wafer fab all automated .
 nobody in fab .
 all sitting in office analysing data .
 even equipment down oso is engineer from vendor .
 all relak and present data and spread sheet  ,  kpkb in meeting .
  say shiong oso not very shiong .
 there are many integrated developer like intel .
  that time less company outsource wafer manufacturing .
 being bottom is not bad if can secure market share  ,  if they persist ,   they will be no .
 3 oso behind tsmc ,  umc
 this is probably micron where they oni make 1 product .
 wafer fab actually quite xiong in planning cos chiu need to use different machine for the different recipe .
 sounds goot if happen to sinkie .
  greedy managers must pay sinkie bonus .
 why u sounds like side with tsmc managers instead of employee
 so many comments here but how many actually worked in semiconductor industry ?
 how many actually have been in a tsmc fab and thus have first hand knowledge of how they operate ?
 the oni thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing .
 actually tradional asian bosses are always quite generous ,  sheng siong is a good example .
 it is those people practice like angmo corporate they are the ones that very niao when come to giving bonus .
 now look at ntuc fairprice .
 u see ,  angmo white slaver/capitalists dont believe in sharing their wealth with the peasant workers .
 they will tell u to buy their company stock if u want to earn more .
 last time my grandpa used to work for the british ,  my mom tell us he never got any year end bonus from his boss ,  every year cny need to go around borrow money from relatives .
 singapore very cheap meh ?
 i am sure property is more affordable in taiwan than singapore
 what the hell chiu tokin ?
 90% of sinkies are on 99 yr lease hdb leh ,  it means it &apos;s just rental ,  not even owning a hdb !
 at least in taiwan people have a choice to live outside crowded city .
 what u tokin about beaches ?
 how many trips chiu make a year to these koh samui ,  phuket  ,  da nang ?
 people in taiwan can suka suka over weekend just drive to hua lian to enjoy the coast leh ,  sinkie go where ?
 coney island ah ?
 kena trap there overnight  ,  feed mozzies
 south asian traits regardless where they are born in
 thats like saying that an uber driver is equally capable as an intel fab engineer .

 abundance of caution kee lan
 pungool is ceca heartland  .
 yes this is very concerning matter ,  if virus is oredi circulating in the community then cb is inevitable oredi .
 that is considered as ph for that school
 maybe he tio the virus for days before the symptoms appear or maybe he is close contact of those infected then asymptomatic for days
 papship not far behind .
 but dont dare kope .
 we should go into cb now ,  at least the damages will not be so big
 just close down for one week lor ,  make sure it &apos;s safe then reopen again .
 now cases are increasing .
 not sure what they waiting for at this time ,  at worse ,  we end up like bolehland + mutant strain
 waiting to see if osa or pogba
 base on the recent cases moh reported  the incubation period has changed
 slumgol is where all the bto filled with sinkie young couples with children ,  rip
 below 16 not approved to take vaccine yet right ?
 so what &apos;s the plan for them ?
 what solution does who and our leaders have for these group of people including those who are allergic or have other health issues ?

 fark ,  i very worry nao
 market will crash .
 went to one clean looking spa not those shady looking ones with neon lights n dark glass panels .
 this spa is in the open ,  with proper company logo design and reception is manned by a plump size malay in uniform .
 the menu is professional looking too .
 i registered using my nric with good security check .
 when i enter the room the normal looking masseuse told me to wear a disposable shorts which is decent looking as it is oversized not those short revealing briefs .
 halfway through the massage the masseuse tore my shorts repeatedly as she progressed to different parts of my bum .
 then finally she tore the entire lower opening and kept brushing against my balls .
 i panicked but just kept quiet but her skillful well timed touches eventually induced an ejaculation .
 i didn’t ask for special in the first place .
 i was flabbergasted and left hurriedly .
 now i’m thinking have i been sexually harassed ?
 in before @petdog and @ramlee
 knn this was not the case for me .
 did chiu pay $50 first
 in after shanghai
 if she neber fist your ass  chiu not violated
 so how much u paid -1 .
 go massage again to double confirm before u make police report
 why never cry this time .
 means ts gotch premature ejaculation problem  .
 touch a bit shoot liao
 shanghai uncle cum in jin fast  .
 no time to say in before shanghai unker
 no oni pay the massage fee
 have hdl surcharge arnot ?
 she got ask chiu for extra tip anot ?
 if no ,  then not violated la .
 she is just doing her job .
 massage involves all parts mah .
 its just that chiu ejaculate .
 counted as pe ah ?
 no one touch me like this for a long time and the way she did it was crazy smooth .
 tore open the side and slipped in her fingers repeatedly between my balls and inner thighs
 please sic location for me to verify .
 thats not a special but u ejaculated .
 no but she rushed in when i’m changing offering me water .
 not sure was that a hint to get tip ?
 touch oni chiu shoot out liao .
 vomit blood that means confirm mati right ?
 gg… vomit blood likely internal injuries
 thats why better pray to sintua deities
 this kinda lanjiao mini bus again  .
 gahment should either ban or restrict the speed limits of such vehicles
 another one bites the dust
 waiting for video if have
 thats serious sia .
 either internal injuries ,  or broke afew teeth
 but doesnt look good .
 fly 3m most probably gone case liao .
 gahment should install mandatory speed limiter for heavy and commercial vehicles .
 something simple and effective to implement .
 the mini bus anyhow drive ?
 looks like another sinkie  .
 46 years probably lost his job now doing delivery then kena chia long .
 internal injuries mean its serious .
 must go hospital stay .
 but doesnt mean will mati .
 unless organs failed
 maybe the blood is not due to internal injures but he accidentally bite his tongue or broke his teeth etc .
 if is internal injures hard to recover .
 the speed limit for mini buses are oredi capped at 70km/h max .
 looks very bad ,  hope he will pull through 
 dunno whose fault
 kumlan marr everyday throw marnie to airconn water huey cao feed mosquitoes .
 gotch 2 humkak gbtb liaoz notch enuf build same patterns kuan at airport .
 cb liao zui liao lui liao gang liao sii gan !
 it will be sers and demolished it reaches 99
 chiu talk like as if all will undergo sers ?
 40 odd years to go .
 should be queenstown or tpy flats lor .
 let them apply lease top up like private 99 year lease .
 think saw some lease below 40 liao
 geylang lor 3 - 60 years lease - oredi going to take back ,  no compensation
 then hdb cover the increased cost to maintain the flat ?
 jin goood deal sia
 what happens to vers ?
 next ones up probably these 2 .
 commonwealth close - built 1967 onwards .
 circuit road - built 1967 onwards
 the geylang ones tio makan liao lor .
 geylang ones chiu mean the terrace houses took back early this yr ?
 those not consider hdb right ?
 yes end of ponzi scheme
 thot pap say hdb buildings not meant to last 99 yrs ?
 kinda reminds me of a friend woodlands block .
 those with single digit or double number .
 those should be near 99 years too .
 can see directly jb & customs .
 outside look a bit rundown ,  but inside is really big & spacious .
  the 4 room hall is more than 2x the size of today 4 rm hdb ( punggol ,  simei .
 )           kinda wasted .
 can the building still stand at that age ?
 commonwealth close if not wrong  .
 40 odd years left
 semiconductor is like the gold mine .
 too bad we aim for ft n easy money
 u miss the whole point .
 so what is your point ?
 comparing the lowest of low in singapore to the highest of high in taiwan ?
 so are chiu in fab1 ?
 sinkie land coy ,  give 4% bonus on normal day .
 now business good ,  give moi 8% .
 talk until i must thank my 18 gen ancestors for the good luck .
 dont say so loud la .
 now pinky and gang got excuse to declare 36 months bonus for themselves liao .
 can fight with evergreen &apos;s 48mnth bonus .
 this pandemic is a wind fall for tw &apos;s and korea company .
 never learn from our smart ministers .
 sign and import ceca talent can easily half the manpower cost at least
 if u compare salary ,  their average pay is even lower than ceca imports .
 reddot should import more tw xmm engineers .
 another stupid kumgong reply ,  chiu wanna compare housing between the entire singapore to taiwan ?
 are chiu that stupid ?
 of course taiwan have much more choices .
 they are 50x bigger .
 so many of their apartments are shitter than singapore hdb .
 no maintainance ,  smaller ,  more ex .
 can tahan 50 years good enough oredi .
 i have taiwanese relatives in both singapore and taiwan .
 not everything is good there la please .
 how many trips chiu make a year to hua lian ?
 people in singapore can suka suka over weekend just drive to desaru to enjoy the coast leh , or take boat to bintan and batam .
 liddat oso dunno .
 get out or not ,  its still a few hours away .
 in that same few hours ,  singapore have many choices as well .
 dont be like ts ,  always come up with kum gong argument
 the oni true democratic country in sea .
 need some kung-fu and well verse technical for independent r&d as there is no reference materials to copy
 singapore has grab ,   has property guru .
 huat la huat la .
 but fir just return to indon
 singapore food delivery riders oso got bonus .
 they work extra time and weekends to earn that bonus .
 quasi demo ,   can ?
 many dont read the article .
 if chiu convert the money to sgd ,  it &apos;s not alot of money .
 but then in taiwan context ,  probably this is very very good oredi .
 tiagong ,   some even got shares ,   how true ?
 u mean which dirty  .
 ops i mean beautiful beach ?
 east coast park or changi ?
 chiu gave chiur bergin post to tish threat !
 huai no mah-cham ?
 malay for like or similar .
 mai gei = dont bruff (chewren)
 the malay word is  &apos;macam &apos; = like ,  sort of .
 oso commonly spelled as  &apos;macam &apos;~  .
 strictly speaking ,  mai gei = dont pretend~ 
 so chiu know malay ?
 so ,  what is the correct malay spelling for  &apos;kena &apos; and  &apos;sekali &apos; ?
 me dunno malay .
 just the few words most sillyporeans knows~  .
 but i have a good fren called .
 both words are spelled correctly in malay .
 (commonly misspelled as  &apos;skarly &apos; or  &apos;scarly &apos;) .
 kena = incur; strike; touch .
 (commonly misspelled as  &apos;kena &apos;) .
 thanks 4 supporting !
 upz for very informative thread !
 thank god its friday
 chiu sho flee at home ?
 i got another acronym to add: .
 bbbcb=bui bui buang zhabor .
 bbcb=bui bui zhabor
 what is  &apos;bui bui buang zhabor &apos; ?
 bui bui + not pretty zhabor ?
 when did q mo get added inside one ?
 since chiu got  &apos;famous &apos; n it gets spam quite alot ?
 my stomache was pretty average ,  these days cannot liao .
 last time go batam for job no problem ,  eat at the open air foodcourt or even street food oso no feeling .
 after i moved to oz where they are strict about food cleaniness(relatively) ,  my stomache cannot tahan any crap stuffs liao .
 the last 5 times i went back batam for job ,  3 times laosai .
 almost went to hospital .
 before coivid if i know i going to places where food cleaniness is not so good ,  i take those pills that boost the stomache for a few days before going
 few years ago i oso eat oredi straight away go pang sai .
 go see tcm and doctor all no use ,  until the tcm doctor recommend gui pi wan ,  ate for a month then much better then stopped eating .
 gui pi wan is for the spleen ,  sometime your weak stomach is not stomach problem but spleen problem ,  can try it ,  but nowadays like out of stock everywhere
 what is this gui pi wan ?
 can share more info ?
 singapore mostly oni got these 2 brands .
 fight fire with fire .
 eat more of what makes chiu laosai .
 its chronic ,  nothing much chiu can do ,  same for me ,  just take note to eat spicy or oily when chiu are near home or at home
 they are fast  !
  they will hide inside your butt hole if chiu try to catch them .
 why are they hospitalised despite being well ?
 while others can stay home
 they once felt great  .
 for the country ,  for their loved ones haahaa ouch  .
 remember how they shill it on social media  .
 i m oso wondering leh .
   say well but y need to be hospitalised ?
  too many beds ?
 now the pro vaxxers trying to justify themselves  .
 we shall see how many of them will go for booster when they turn come  .
 kekeke so far i haven’t seen any pro vax going for booster
 hahah ya ya .
 taken your booster shot liao mah ?
 good and analytic post .
 the ones that should be questioned are those that 1) have not been vaccinated and has no reason not to be and 2) oni partially vaccinated - what fantastic reason do these folks have for being the last in the race .
 booster is oni available for >= 60 years old right now .
 chiu ok or not ?
 still g0tch balance 3665 beds .
 i think can safely assume partial means something went wrong ,  allergic reaction or something .
 cannot be one leg step in then other leg dont right ?
 have used it for some time liao
 partial as of today means they were sceptical up to 20 days ago .
 and that puts them in the anti vax camp , frankly .
 soon will be your turn  .
 6 months nia right after that antibodies will drop
 booster has recently been made available for 50yo too .
 i just missed and actually i was thinking to approach pte clinics to get sinovac full dose on top of the pfizer that i had .
 hospitals still could handle as o2 patients r not high mah !
 u see other countries  ,  people flooded in hospitals without oxygen  !
 chose not to be sh sai bo ?
 there is a reason why not made mandatory right ?
 like ns is compulsory  ,  no questions asked .
 truth hurts right
  just like our bcg .

 ts u lose him la… .
 he got it free huan
 goot and cheep .
 these 2 are surprisingly in gd state .
 dunno why ended up on clearance category .
 i think the staff anyhow throw .
 me get those vegs oni if me have plans on what to cook for the day .
 if not ,  rarely buy just to store in the fridge
 this kind of withered vegetables go pasir panjang wholesale market can pick up from the dumping area for free .
 wow how come so cheap at giant ?
 still look ok .
 wet market normal to have this price .
 i take bas go pasir panjang cum back more ex then this alrdy  .
 going giant now !
 most of the time the condition is pretty bad .
 but sometimes can find gd gems .
 i find discounted poultry ,  is a better deal .
 fish unless chiu cooking with spicy ingredients else best not bother about it .
 fruit oso can consider since it is super expensive these days and slightly more durable for some like orange and apple .
 going giant later to search edmwer pick up vege
 some are still good ,  believe they label to clear cos new batch come and they dont want to display together .
 i will oso eye the delmonte banana at half price ,  some are still firm if not will use them to bake banana cake .
 poultry i usually buy frozen ones which are always cheaper .
 i know some prefer fresh ones cos they say frozen got a smell but i cant tell the diff so just buy the cheaper one .
 actually these days ,  so called fresh oso frozen but for a day or 2 during transportation before display .
 the main differences between frozen and fresh ,  to me is tenderness of meat ,  frozen meat tends to be more tough ,  fresh is softer .
 paging for persons with experience of covid .
 1) do chiu require medical treatment ?
 or self recover ?
 2) what is your feeling when chiu know you’re +ve .

 5) do chiu feel completely normal after chiu recover ?

 civil servant pai tan ?
 pte sector harder  .
 sme even worse .
 academics and almost all staff (tech or non-tech) in tertiary oso very shiok .
 civil servant in singapore is the most hor tan  .
 and xian nan job liao  .
 their ot is zzzzz
 cannot argue logic  ,  make personal attack .
 singkee  coolie jean on display liao
 yeah no 10 yr series to follow to reach next tech node .
 this is what i heard too .
 tsmc basically chooses staff from the top uni as their pay is probably the best in tw for similar positions but their ot is quite scary .
 a normal work day is more like 12 -13 hours
 but the england is really powerderful .
 we could have been a competitor ,  maybe wont be able to be on par ,  but at least we could take a slice of the semiconductor pie .
 but no ,  our shortsighted useless leaders decided to go for short cuts ,  dont nurture singapore engineers ,  sold off our semiconductor industry and went to make all engineers become financial advisors/insurance or property agents .
 and now gahment start to lament on shortages of talents for fintech and it industry .
 really a useless govt
 by the rent seeking behavior papayas dissuaded all industries needing creativity  and innovation
 of late singapore is late for almost every game .
 lack of foresight on countless times
 broken tooth don’t think will bleed so much .
 if bleed from the heart then 100% gg ,  if other parts of the body organs then got chance to pull through .
 personal safety on the road is related to health
 this is why they should not rejoice when told this is a good job for sinkies cos of ft
 i reserve my comments .
 some grab cyclists are not angels either .
 so best is see if van have video
 could it be biker chiong out of small lane without giving way to oncoming van ,  then van driver cant stop in time and bang biker flying 3m away and tor hwee  ?
 got video of the accident ?
 this not mini bus .
 is mini ferrari
 quite sure is mini bus prob
 supposedly all these delivery drivers ,  hawkers are what ceca are coming in to do ,  but p$p  cheated us and give good jobs to ceca  ,  using ceca to replace sinkies in corporate office ,  now sinkies have to do all the dirty jobs .
 his is a standard injury .
 upon impact motorcyclist usually kena head and chest injury first .
 chest injury will have blood vomitting .
 sad for that delivery rider and hope he recovers .
 doing such jobs though cn be well paid but it comes with lots of risks .
 mini bus could be delivering parcels .
 destroyed by sinkie order with commission of $6 .
 vomit so much blood most likely gg ,  rip
 how to know whose fault
 this is very serious matter .
 gahment should provide better jobs for sinkies other than these dangerous grab delivery jobs .
 our great leader want go sexy way ,  semiconductor too tough and not suitable for his ceca talent: .
 when i go support at tw ,   i finish my work at 8pm and go for dinner .
 my tsmc support engineer join me ,   and after dinner ,   he rushed back to work again until mid night .
 his schedule continue for 6 days a week ,   and live in company hostel nearby .
 oni go home in weekend .
 either using employees to launder money ,  or (more likely) unloading corporate tax burden on to employees .
 here even if the company make big profit  ,  the bonus is capped at 3 months .
 unfortunately such things neber happen in sinkieland for normal sinkies - excluding silver serpents
 why are we always jealous of others ?
 is it cos we put in the same effort but their rewards are much better than ours ?
 or we are just jealous of others assuming the rewards othera received are for not doing anything…
 tsmc r&d team england is americano based ,  no worry
 by extension of your logic ,  singapore &apos;s got more percentage of laundering money or lighten corporate tax using the same means by paying top management obscene renumerations  .
 and maybe can consider sheng siong oso since they can give 8 months bonus but ntuc cannot  
 come on ,  let &apos;s share your conspiracy theory leh .
 no conspiracy theory sir  .
 just wonder why  .
 mask is compulsory no ?
 but i do enjoy seeing these pro vaxxers diam diam now  .
 ok la still see some ig posts dine in twos  .
 i see liao i drill cos i chose not to vax  .
 i oredi lost the memory of how it was to jiak restaurant le  .
 one keyword i notice is observation  .
 might not be all well for them
 i was thinking about this oso .
 is it something missing or not considered ?
 the absolute number of unvax covid cases confirm is lower based on 83% vs 17% but end up with 50/50 belong in severe cases ?
 all this while ,  i respect the decision of people i know who wanna get jabbed .
 its those people who are constantly hounding us instead  .
 i shared previously ,  i was even called stupid not to take .
 gahment was so quick in securing the vaccines for us blah blah blah
 last time say jab liao prevent getting virus .
 then become decrease spread .
 then prevent serious sick .
 then prevent die .
 then lower down die % .
 by the way ,  alot of patients / high risk group cannot take the jab due to health conditions ,  just alot people dont understand .
 got cases that who took and pass away due to side effect too .
 children oso not yet take ma
 thats my point .
   there was a thread this morning on an edmwer sharing his experience after getting the virus .
   in the end got few vaxxed jokers coming out to start calling names and blaming the ts
 i underestimate chiu .
 was waiting for a good conspiracy theory to submit to moh  .
 yup internet is serious business  .
 anyway back to more serious bit .
 why not compulsory - let me explain .
 there are many good things in life which are not compulsory or legislated by law eg .
 loving your family .
 being good to your neighbours .
 helping the poor .
 now ,  why the difference in masks (compulsory) and vaccination (not compulsory) .
 let me first of all tell chiu that i totally reject outdoor masking .
 its nonsense when the majority are vaccinated .
 vaccination is not compulsory cos there are indeed people with genuine reasons that they cannot be vaccinated .
 oso ,  its not difficult to chaokeng a medical reason not to be vaccinated .
 by the way ,   chiu may not believe this (feel free to google) ,  do chiu know that special needs children are exempted from the compulsion of mask wearing if they cannot do so so even the so called compulsory making has its exceptions .
 enforcement for something that cannot be seen (vaccination) is much harder compared to something obvious like mask .
 anyway ,  its past 1230 ,  so this will be my last post .
 when i wake up tomorrow will check if i got any  notification and will reply to chiu then .
 hahaahahah being sheep is easy for many  .
 for the weak acceptance feels great .
 chiu have those chao peasants who did not make it in life with low ses life suddently teaching us how to live our life back then haha
 is like vaxxed wear full gear go skateboard ,  unvaxxed wear birthday suit skateboard but both equal chance to break bones kind of thing   aiya this whole situation is a mess la ,  i just praying silently everyday nothing bad happens to those around me 
 i think we are there oredi .
 boris johnson is a dua bui and needed oxygen and look at how he is still pm of great britain .
 dunno why the need to whack us .
 are we hindering them ?
 perhaps they really believe once hit a certain percentage ,  we are really gonna open up .
 how naive is that
 last year there was a story on an auntie in which she needed to continue oxygen therapy (probably an oxygen concentrator) at night after discharge .
  consumables not that cheap .
 and device every few years need replacement .
 madam choy was discharged at the end of july and has gone back to work as an office manager ,  but the virus has taken its toll .
 she lost 9kg ,  and now weighs just 43kg .
 for the rest of her life ,  she will have to use a non-invasive ventilation machine to help her breathe when she sleeps .
 she is oso undergoing physiotherapy to help her regain strength in her limbs .
 after recovered from covid ,  these long term damaging effects on the patients will still put a strain on the healthcare system and might even die (but no longer classified under death due to covid) ,  we might not know about the death figures of some of these covid recovered patients later on .
 brother if chiu wanna trap people chiu should not say so clearly and ask me any conspiracy or not  .
 cos if i answer to chiu then it’s clearly a conspiracy theory liao mah which is as the term suggest  .
 chiu should ask the edmw-er anything to share and if he share then chiu jitao trap him
 iron ong reassures chiu that we are good
 so what happened ?
 i kena black magic ,  have a headache .
 see neurologist ,  he said nothing wrong with me and referred me to imh .
 i went to imh with a doctor referral letter .
 headache become imh ?
 doesnt make sense .
 chiu ask the doctor la ,  chiu ask me .
 i oso angry chiu know why need go siao lang place and eat siao medicine .
 but if i don’t go ,  police come to catch me in my house and ask me go imh stay chiu know .
 yes im an ex imh patient .
 treatment getting too exp and useless so i discharged myself from outpatient appts as well .
 been living with it since long time ago .
 still following up on yearly basis
 those edmwers that stay in yishun are especially more potent .
 i have eating disorder
 get a record in imh and if anything shit happens in future ,  it can be a valuable escape card .
   esp when chiu are not a woman .
 i dont think we have ex-patients here .
 most of them need to take medicine for life .
 ya man siao liao it &apos;s like the preplan for this case to happen school really closed on monday !
 singapore ceca town tio liao
 if no covid case every day ,  then me worry :/
 liddat consider linked cases anot .
 even if 1000 covid these are considered linked and wont affect bubble .
 monday is school holidays for all schools cos of off-in-lieu for may day
 in before rock and bend
 ring fenced liao .
 yes my son confirm no school on monday
 monday is a gazetted school holiday la deh !
 areas of residence infested by ceca include east coast ,  marine parade ,  sengkang and punggol .
 ares of work full of such filthy shameless snakes are changi business park ,  mbfc ,  suntec sh !
 covid no ezlink card .
 mai spread fear leh
 monday no school for moe pri/secondary/jc etc as oil for labour day la dey !
 it is 3 days lag as i do know of 1 case ,  oredi confirmed ,  but released 3 days later .
 chiu talking to those clowns ?
 ceca is truly talented
 ts arrested due to osa yet ?
 moe still no official statement on this ?
 this one no joking matter so should release statement by now
 pending for real news to come out
 get vaccinated if chiu can ,  doesnt matter if it &apos;s us or cheena vaccine .
 lesser chance of getting covid ,  lesser chance of spreading ,  and lesser chance of dying .
 less chance of dying oni .
 the rest same lah
 not true anymore ,  it helps with spread and infection ,  evidence piling up .
 what are chiu trying to preach here ?
 we are oredi way past convincing people to take vaccines .
 singapore is 85% vaccinated oredi .
 but our cases are hitting new highs even with less testing .
 deaths are hitting new highs .
 deaths and new covid cases are both from vaccinated and non vaccinated .
 we took the vaccines ,  and the results are apparent .
 are the vaccines effective ?
 i can oni say that they are not working as expected .
 even pm lee gave up yesterday ,  admitting that the vaccines will not stop transmission and deaths ,  and that we should live with the virus .
 chiu should try to convince the vaccinated population why they should take the booster .
 is the booster going to be effective ?
 if we take booster ,  and death rates continue to rise ,  then how ?
 have u saw this ?
 u gotta beleive this .
 this one is data from the us as well .
 nobody said it stops transmission and death .
 it greatly reduces ,  not stops .
 we &apos;ve opened up our country since .
 if we weren &apos;t mostly vaccinated ,  the numbers would be far greater .
 this is just common sense .
 not hard to understand .
 how come so many vaxxers tio covid leh ?
 amongst those who required oxygen supplementation and icu ,  49 .
 5% were fully vaccinated and 50 .
 5% were unvaccinated/ partially vaccinated .
 keep taking usa data where vaccination rates are low .
 while in singapore… .
 my speculation is that those who bothered to be vaccinated in the us or anywhere else ,  are oso taking precautions like being masked up and washing hands ,  being respectful of the virus while taking more responsibility to protect themselves .
 but i oso believe that ,  ya ,  no difference except severity of the cases .
 this type of nonsense is what mislead mtf into thinking at 80% vaccination = victory condition .
 but the ratio of vaccinated vs unvaccinated is 85:15
 walan your maths fail .
 in case u are wondering why many us states are missing from the chart ,  thats cos in those states they dont even give u the number breakdown of vaxed vs unvaxed cases !
 politics or not .
 whether chiu are selfish or selfless ,  the results are clear .
 sounds like csb .
 good quality one .
 not those cai peng story  ,  what give ah mah lesser  ,  then got standing  &apos;ovulation &apos; 
 chiu should have charged her instead for touching your ball ball
 walan that thread 
 how much did chiu tip the massage lady ?
 got say thank chiu ?
 shoot that time song song .
 now kehkeh say u dont want
 she didnt check your colour ?
 got analyse your color healthy or not ?
 no need to takes up special package oredi shooted .
 ts tan dio ,  the massager lady suay lugee .
 massage time stim can always say soli sensitive
 ts : yes chiu have been violated .
 please report police and aware .
 if chiu are a virgin before the act ,  can claim loss of virgin bonus/damages of $0 .
 premature ejaculation chiu no hear before .
 oso likely virgin so extra virgin olive sensitive
 actually the masseur should report u instead cos u pewpew while she doing a clean massage .
 and bro , likely u were thinking stray the moment she asked u to change into the shorts and your mind went xrated during the  &apos;shiok-ordeal &apos; .
 mind very powerful to actaully made your xdd pumped and pew
 is this another chow gey thread .
 is it at balestier
 it is baffling 
 pe got benefit then !
 just look at her disrespectful body language .
 how will the ccp punish her when she goes cheena ?
 for those who havent heard of drive la like me ,  basically someone will put their car up for rent via drive la app .
 once chiu booked the car ,  chiu need to locate the car in the carpark and chiu can then unlock the car using a slider button in the app .
 no key is required as it is using push start button .
 chiu can then use the car until chiu song .
 chiu never get to see the owner .
 just drive and park back .
 not sure about petrol or cashcard though .
 but if i were the car owner i would be a bit worried during the renting period .
 oso the cleanliness inside .
 for just $60 ,  the worry is quite alot .
 this threat deserves a
 fake cheesepie  ,  usually refer to guys using clone account acting a female identity  ?
 bruff chewren  ,  bluff children  ?
 thx for contributing !
 thx for the effort ts .
 should make it a sticky 
 is actually a semi-sticky thread liao~  .
 inside tish sticky~ .
 links to edmw community threads
 upz for newbies & lao jiao lurkers~  .
 this is a good thread .
 can print out for personal reference ,  no copyright hor ?
 i think no copyright ,  chiu have private label rights .
 free for personal consumption~  .
 y do u need to print it out ?
 i think most people just bookmark this thread n refer to it as needed~  .
 u oni need it when u are online in edmw~ 
 luffy suck kuku 
 wei ,  gos up the hippo family thread reh~  .
 helped me to decipher some of the  &apos;words &apos; used by posters here .
 edmwers always create funny terms to smoke people de~  .
 cum ask here whenever u have anything u dont understand~  .
 remember to rate this thread n vote in the polls !
 tish is the best threat eber in edmw !
 sarpork dip dip~  .
 shameless self-promo ftw~ .
 chiu is farnnie~  .
 what do chiu think ?
 for semicon ,  from what i heard at that time ,  someone presented the immerse opportunity of semicon to the establishment at that time .
 those days were sinkie glory days of hdd manufacturing ,  and the establishment jeered at the tiny ic chip that was presented to them as they compare it to their glorious investment in hdd manufacturing .
 and what i was told ,  the one who presented the semicon opportunity hence went on to hong kong and tw .
 the rest of the history are well documented .
 now for bio science ,  again i heard ,  the establishment is looking over the shoulder of the r&d they invested in .
 kind of like instant noodle mentality ,  today invest tomorrow wants return .
 so ,  many actually setup then close shop ,  rinse and repeat .
 why my company doesnt have 
 the tomorrow usually is many many moons downstream .
 here no holding power
 we have the middle low tier pie .
 macam like chinese pong biscuit (4pcs for $2 )vs angmo black forest ( 1 slide for $5)
 but many dunno what these cheena phase mean la ,   how hah ?
 we study hard so we can graduate to deliver food to ceca with fake degrees .
 end up seagate ,  and hgst oso left singapore ,  and our hdd manufacturing died .
 on the opposite side ,  semicon is thriving worldwide with chipmakers putting in large orders with semicon manufacturers
 another illogical reply that doesnt make any sense .
 eat too much angmo sausage head cannot think is it ?
  or no friends there ?
 so have to come back to edmw to put down sinkie to make yourself feel good
 we dont even have pong piah loh .
 dont talk about manufacturing of chips and wafers .
 even on the software side we failed badly on cybersecurity with laughing stock news appearing in the news every year
 if chiu understand the technology behind it ,  its exactly like a printing business .
 u buy the printer from asml and someone give u the ecad file and print one million copies .
  ,  not much value add ,  except u tune the process to increase the yield and it consumes lots of water and electricity .
 thats why garmen shifted the focus .
  and sell chartered semi to uae sovereign funds .
 (see video) some of the chartered engineers was head hunted by ah-tiong &apos;s smic in the process .
 but b &apos;cos of apple + tesla + covid .
 tsmc suddenly become the superstar .
 in the end of day ,  they are still a sweat shop .
 as all the ip are controlled by american ,  tools by dutch and raw materials by nipponland ,  thats why trump can impose export controls on  ah-tiongs .
 and strangle huawei &apos;s neck !
 i think thats cos of pinky &apos;s dream of making singapore like wall street
 same thing can be said to all manufacturing plants .
 they are just duplicating one design .
 the thing is manufacturing is a huge cash cow and high tech processes requiring more in depth knowledge and intellect ,  eg .
 the 7nm or 4nm fab process (is there such a thing ?
 bioscience processes making drugs and vax are another example .
 yes ,  no doubt manufacturing require lots of resources but in turn it oso improve the education and living standard of everyone in the vicinity .
 not saying manufacturing should be the oni industry to focus on .
 just that it is a pity to let it drop just liddat .
 cos to revive manufacturing sector ,  if thats what pinky is thinking ,  will be a long and arduous process .
 some of pinky speech make it very clear ,  manufacturing is not coming back to reddot ,  instead they all headed to bolehland (chips ,  intel) ,  philippines (harddisks) and indonesia (pharma ,  ev battery) .
 with the service&aviations industry almost wipeout from the pandemic ,  sinkies can prepare to eat air in 10yrs time .
 skolar rotated every 2 or 3 yrs ,  of course wan instant result to get promoted and collect bonus
 problem is all the engineers grad liao all want to ghost bank work
 true ,  banker can wear nice nice ,  chitchat with all the chio bu in the pantry .
 who wants to work in manufacturing and face the boring machine every day  ?
 didnt we supress tsmc presence in singapore in the past .
 their factory now here dunno what warehouse or something
 where if workers ask for raise ,  the company will immediately put up the job on mcf for two weeks to hire cheaper foreign workers and sack the local .
 come down to the sub branch to visit us than say that dont worry he will increase our salary to 1400 from next month on  .
 he say we need to stay open mind and he planning to replace the sinkie manager to a south asian one as he says the sinkie manager very demanding  .
 our salary now is 1100
 your big boss is sinkie or south asian ?
 u say 1400 oredi know is not simple
 the big boss walk around office and take many selfie with my colleagues  .
 he say that he want to come sub branch himself to see how is the ground sentiments  .

 many of the ministers are quite old .
 this is a good age group for delta to fix .
 ong &apos;s ego and his ambition to become pm at the expense of elderly &apos;s life .
 ok that was a little too fast lol
 how can that be fast ?
 it was a little too long liao .
 this angmo is too compassionate  .
 angmo is pump and dump  .
 angmo come and go liao
 i thought long ago liao .
 he must have found another sinkie spg to let him do anal
 the ig photos of her and the bf all gonr
 she can easily find another angmo .
 chrysan lee is an instagram star ,  who has a total assets of $1 million – $5 million at 23 years old years old .

 crysan gotch leak .
 consumables are goods used by individuals that must be replaced regularly cos they wear out or are used up .
 i guess the word consumables fits her well .
 doesn’t matter if chiu don’t get covid .
 chiu need case % of the 85% and case % of the 15% then compare with the 50/50 numbers .
 the stats in singapore dont seem to support your nonsense .
 i mean theory .
 what are the case percentage numbers ?
 gahment conveniently omitted breakdowns of cases recently no ?
 an extrapolation could be gotten by taking the weekly % from when they were still reporting and use that % on say this week’s cases to find the %breakdown .
 but people will say estimation oni buey zhun .
 even tho logically if wanna say not accurate it’s sorta true in the sense that there should be way more vaxxed cases now than before since so many restrictions on unvax .
 ok ,  good point .
 in this case ,  it is hard to tell .
 do we have a choice ?
 it’s the nature of the virus  .
 we don’t have a choice
 so far the oni proven way is wear the full ppe suit  .
 u see they close contact on daily basis and the infection is relatively low
 i think is fake dr la .
 the qualifications from those cert mills 1 .
 fail very badly .
 chiu just shortened your lifespans coming soon  .
 please kindly read clearly .
 it is not a given .
 by far ,  these so called articles have shown no quantifiable evaluation but oni qualitative opinion .
 to put bluntly to chiu ,  they made sure they always state a disclaimer i .
 breakthrough cases etc which means not a 100% confidence level .
 this is oso why they will always put in fine line that they are still risk of these asymptomatic cases transmitting the spread .
 oni dumb retards will take case studies of other countries of different demographics and apply to singapore .
 the social behavior of the people is oredi differing by a large extent .
 we have been practicing mask on for the longest time ,  and the spike started since vaccinated count increased and have more freedom to mask off and gather .
 dont put it on delta .
 delta was oredi here prior to the relaxation of vaccinated individuals .
 israel data oredi say is <50% efficacy for infection .
 means at most improve 1x for infection .
 oni higher for death rate protection
 need ig see her in other attires .
 nehnehpok looks like zhng need more pic

 kfc chicken is cannot eat .
 popeyes or texas better .
 sure got people buy .
 looks pretty ok
 nice to jiak notch
 kfc not bad la .
 original still good .
 same recipe as previous ?
 found it to be too oily and salty then .
 maybe didnt let the oil drip off enough before serving or double fried .
 that size kfc is much better
 u buy n gpgt then we can see how the real size
 can gpgt the actual chickens ?
 who tried liao ?
 how come so many people here .
 never try the test launch  .
 a few months ago ?
 original is ok ,  the spicy .
 if is the same recipe from 20 yrs ago .
 tt one is nt oil .
 didnt try the previous
 had afew laughs .
 is =                               ish

 u din know about this thread till now ?
 guess my shameless self-advertising is not shameless enuff~  .
 will up my advertising budget~ 
 ohhh ,  k ,  noted .
 dontch just  &apos;ok noted &apos; reh~  .
 must vote in the polls n rate the thread too~  .
 done ,  done and done .
 jiak bah buay ?
 keeping thread alive  .
 but how cum chiu neber vote in poll + rate thread~  .
 i is got vote liao rong rong ago .
 oni worth while industry ,  .
 that made money u say leh
 to our policymakers ,  the definition of talent is based on nationality one .
 oni uptrons are sought after .
 oni umc still around .
 if im not wrong .
 suspect tsmc con our garmen subsidies .
 but they cannot play punk with us ,  else biden &apos;s ban hammer will ensure  they immediate gg .
 seriously ,  that is nothing .
 12-13 hours per day oni comes to 60-65hr per week .
 many of those top earners in medicine ,  finance and tech easily hit those kind of hours as well .
 the story i heard was that our policymakers decided that the amount of investments required to keep chartered at the forefront was too much ,  and did not want to take the risk .
 maybe there was an issue of scale as well .
 whether those reasonings are sound or not is very much debatable .
 but looking our economic planning in the last two decade ,  i would say that our policymakers are not as world class as they like to portray themselves .
 oni world class at toot-ing their own horns when they have minor successes .
 if chiu look back the decision is still valid ,  even till today intel still dont have the know-how to achieve high yields for 5nm .
 and uae has invested >50b into gf .
 since they brought chartered .
 in short ,  there is no business case until covid hits hard .
 and suddenly selling companies like chartered ,  neptune  feels like killing the goose for the golden eggs .
 today tw &apos;s tsmc and evergreen are the hottest stock to buy ,  all thanks to covid !
 in wafer fab ,  there is work 3 days rest 4 days then work 4 days rest 3 days rotation .
 so wont be too intense de
 now the chase for crypto start when at the point they should have consider unicorn investor
 from mobile to data centres to ev cars ,   all need chips .
 the high demand is always there .
 its just the covid lockdown made the demand go stratospheric and people are now aware that semiconductor is not a sunset industry ,  its a cutting edge .
 it became sexy again
 its like a&e doctors ,  they work multiple days shift .
 when young your body can take this kind of punishments ,  but once chiu hit middle age .
 most will quit !
 if hit middle age still not in management ,  i think maybe change job ba
 singapore is full of engrish elite speaking people but lose to a chinese / hokkien language country
 it’s not a game we can play anyway ,  tsmc capex this year is us$44bn ,  the capex alone is much bigger than market caps of  all companies in singapore except se and dbs .
 it really is a big boys game .
 on top of that ,  we just don’t produce enough engineers and phds for this type of industry .
 being a small country ,  we have to pick our battles .
 this kind of money save later spend on doctors earning chiu money .
 indeed ,  we have to pick our battles .
 let’s not forget that wafer fabs need lots of electricity and water ,  something that we don’t have in abundance and it’s not cheap ,  as compared to taiwan… .
 in any case ,  semiconductor oni became sexy in last couple of years ,  prior to this ,  i remember this forum always called it sunset industry and we were having problems trying to recruit engineers .
 think lose to evergreen shipping in taiwan ,  got claims that most of the taiwan based shore employees and oso the crews are getting 48months bonus .
 singapore labour from the whole world still cant compete with tw ?
 the same problem singapore face ,  tw oso have .
 tw never take shortcut like ceca deal ,  singapore for everyone and fry property
 its goot they sell nol ,  if not must explain why management get 48yrs bonus and emoloyee get 1 week bonus with threat of retrenchment
 sunset industry my a$$ ,  oni those want to sell chartered came up with that excuse .
 relac la brudder
 if every patient is living with 3 other people ,  high chance it will spread to all of them ,  cases will 4x within days .
 chiu expect the person to stay inside the master bedroom all day for 14 days meh ?
 most master bedrooms are much smaller and ill equipped than hotels .
 question is why are we not quarantining people in facilities away from families ?
 we have d &apos;resort ,  activate more hotel rooms ,  or even build the expo place again la .
 having home quarantine is the same as no quarantine .
 the virus will spread to families ,  who go out to buy food or to even eat outside and spread to more people like a leaky bucket .
 if we are serious about containing the virus this is the biggest loophole imo .
 which one more likely .
 food handlers not wearing mask properly .
 actually we need n95 masks but there &apos;s not enough stock .
 others (please elaborate)
 covid is endemic ,   .
 in other words it spread just like normal flu
 and it is impossible to stop flu from spreading .
 lockdown forever oso no use
  be a hermit sua .
 guessed correctly first one .
 conclusion is population density
 its air brone and its everywhere .
 close proximity with an infected even in open places like parks etc
 yea chiu guess correctly ,  public transport ,  taxi ,  phv  ,  some hawkers  ,  delivery ones
 nope ,  open places less danger which chiu claim park as long people do social distance will be safe .
 mrt ,  taxi ,  phv is a bit different cos inside train ,  car is confine unlike open space .
 vaccinated going around like they oredi have immunity ?
 i think unlinked are all from ktv cluster .
 they did not turn on tt so no one can tell they went ktv
 confine spaces where air is recirculated .
  with more vaccinated ,  asymptomatic infected vaccinated people are walking around like stealth carriers infecting people… .
 by the time their symptoms are noticed… .
 chiu cannot trace where they got it from liao ,  so they classify as unlinked .
 when a person is tested positive ,  the immediate family are quarantine .
 but i think no pursue who the immediate family members come into contact with in the workplace etc .
 hence there might be transmission from the family members to alot for people after one of the family members are positive ,  .
 so the ringfence is for the immediate family ,  but how about those that come into contact with before the ringfence ?
 so u  want the truth .
 can u handle it ?
 feels like wong gan and jo (now ong) and his buddies have failed badly in managing the pandemic since jan 2020 .
 100s of millions and billionss of taxpayer dollars have gone down the drain .
 payouts to businesses ,  to citizens ,  what trace together crap and the result - the cant even solve the unlink case probelms ?
 change my view .
 for public transport ,  moh still can track via tt app and token mah .
 unlinked from those who went to watch ndp preview fireworks ?
 cannot say ndp cluster mah right… .
 1 reason is complacent sinkies ?
 dunno can believe or not
 ask her to suck kukujiao .
 taiwan show business can not trust one
 she so old liao  ?
 she wasn &apos;t raped when she was in show business .
 the culprits arent in show business .
 at least not as revealed by post
 14 years old stuff now then say .
 no witness no nothing .
 she say she tio rape  7 7 49 days oso can
 i oso kena rape before
 she could have gone to the police .
 tell us for what .
 yesh moi got think of this too
 taiwan news can trust one meh ?
 its not taiwan news .
 she appeared on tv show .
 not some investigative show
 no video as evidence ,  must be fake
 no proof ,  she says xi ji ping raped her at age 5 oso can
 please provide proof .
 hw comes noes 1 comprains npnt ?
 she got leaked video is it ?
 hopefully angmo will release some good videos of them .
 break up cos of the leak ?
 go bikeforum search chrysan   .
 online somewhere say too loose ,  pump no feeling ,   thus angmo dumped her !
 she &apos;s building experience to benefit the next angmo .
 constantly upgrading her skillset
 notch bad ,  too bad her leaks are permanent on the web .
 since when got angmo ?
 she should do something about those leaks
 angmo go airport is to transit nia .
 cos no mountain for staycation ,  retire ,  or tour .
 so ugly can be satr ?
 i google and now i know who .
 saw her on yt before .
 she a msian right .
 i remember she got msia accent 1 last time when see her video
 are sinkies by and large love to use their clout to inflict all kinds of injustices to any  &apos;outsider &apos; that dares to assert themselves ?
 gahment should ban mini bus
 aircon mbfc jobs/1 .
 5m condo for ceca .
 bloody tarmac ending for sinkie .
 such a dismal reality .
 before flaming the mini bus driver ,  we need more evidence too .
 may or may not be the driver fault
 your post is the saddest of all .
 singapore not ready for bicycles on roads but gahmen dont care .
 reputation of these 2 are well known but for us who drive the night ,  tends to be more biased against the vans  .
 those assholes really testing the limits of the vans in the middle of the night .
 whereas bikers doing delivery are a tad lower in terms of recklessness
 geylang is one big clusterfark .
 bikes going in all directions on a one way road .
 riders are always at the losing end .
 ask youself is it worth it  ?
 can choose a safer job eg security ,  cleaners ,  etc .
 grab any insurance for all this delivery guys  ?
 first time was stationary traffic at red light .
 so was moving between lanes to the front .
 then the fucker decided to turn for god knows what reason .
 2nd was red light as well .
 im actually in my lane and coming to a stop ,  then the fucker came up from behind thinking that i was going to lanesplit to the front .
 but i cant due to limited space .
 one bbfa slammed into bus cos skidded on wet road  .
 oso vomit brood
 ownself insurance  .
 die anthony laughing
 not cursing  ,  if able to survive  .
 hospital bills oso will cause his heart stop
 grab jobs for sinkies .
 chiu know the rest .
 sheet place la geylang there .
 lanes very narrow .
 vehicles tend to speed faster cos geylang very long they want to travel as fast as possible to clear .
 still got vehicles turning from right and left lorongs to join the main road .
 then got vehicles parked at right side of road .
 then got bus wan filter here there .
 then got pedestrians wan dash across to cross the road .
 chiu mean the sticker behind the mini buses ?
 it’s should be 90 plus cos that’s the speed they drive during early morning peak hour ferrying school children
 most of these drivers can speed with school chewren inside
 vomit blood most probably means inside all messed up liao .
 even if they dont ,  one can imagine how these drivers drive when u see bodykit ,  neon lights ,  sports rims etc  .
 back during the days of good market with angmo and tourist ,  they oso terrorise people with their party bus business .
 same as healthy no need wear masks .
 chiu get the idea ?
 ponding not flooding .
 means the air quality got better  ?
 some kind of  &apos;not necessary a bad thing &apos; statement again ?
 your oxygen level drops does not mean u r not having enough oxygen .
 your heart beat is lower doesnt mean it &apos;s not working .
 your eyes cant see doesnt mean u r blind .
 means the air may be smelly ,  but it is clean .
 or the politicians wear white ,  so they are not corrupt .
 voting opposition does not mean people are opposition supporters
 this is the state of the pap gahemn today .
 its either burning smell or no burning smell
 your heart not beating does not mean chiu are dead
 the burnt particles floating in air is good for health .
 chao tar air is fresh .
 the new freshness
 milk may turn sour .
 but it are still drinkable .
 snakes are poisonous .
 but they are harmless .
 robbers broke into our house .
 to make our home safer .
 ceca are coming to steal jobs .
 to create more employment for locals .
 hungry doesnt mean chiu need to eat oso ?
 i wonder how these guys can sleep at night while telling all these kind of **** .
 means your sense of smell still there = no covid
 dont want to lockdown instead ask us be prepare to be infected .
 and dont be embarassed lolol .
 think is a joke ?
 useless incompetent leaders
 not as bad as those kumgongs who voted them in .
 greedy and useless jiakliaobees .
 we can see their incompetence during troubled times like now
 they really think that sinkies are kumgong .
 thats how they rise to their position .
 history taught us the dynasty falls all cos the useless emperor listen to the fawns of the eunuch  .
 the spicy is just eating flour .
 they not flexible .
 no 3 pc meals like kfc .
 iirc more than 20 years ago it was oredi sold at six plus seven plus bucks .
 cant expect price not to go up .
 20 years ago i think the big mac not more than $5 .
 last time mac dont have gourmet meals .
 the meat inside was juicy yes but the oil can be seen driping from the skin .
 maybe that particular mc no qc .
 will try this new release soon
 huh the size so small ah
 cant really remember but back then prices what i could recall was those standard double cheeseburger/muck chicken meals were 5 bucks and big mac meals slightly higher ?
 a cheeseburger was 2 bucks ala carte and it was my go to snack lol .
 but probably will be good
 will take alot of effort to be as bad as kfc never mind worse .
 i rather have this at $8 .
 wa never eat before !
 this one got spicy  .
 version or not ?
 oni few mac have 
 during my sec school days they launch mcspicy i think is $5 .
 somemore is 2 piece thigh meat one 
 waiting for 1 for 1
 yes ,  spicy without the  &apos;mcspicy detox effect &apos; .
 at compass point .
 chiu shoot out so fast is abnormal  .
 she wanna ask chiu want extra ma
 ts forgot to take medicine ?
 shanghai uncle never dies
 laofunker clone spotted .
 ts ,  sic the spa massage center ,  i need to go verify chiu story  .
 by the way can chiu provide a more detail field report 
 the masseuse never charge extra consider good liao .
 this is not the case in japan documentary series on health massages .
 in after legendary padre story
 ex education and next health ministar said school is safer .
 wait long long la ,  maybe when pinky tio then they will finally close the gate
 how to be safe when children not vaccinated yet
 that one is jinx ,  cannot trust him
 if swap whole school is very serious matter .
 if real i bet is ceca strain of covid .
 i saw the letter too .
  but better not post .
 in case the whole thing is a hoax .
 safer wait for official release .
 finally someone say something that make sense .
 eg: the letter from school maybe deemed as confidential as not all members of the public is the intended receipient .
 so sharing of the letter publicly maybe an infringement .
 but unless there is a gag order on the parents and students ,  how is the news considered as osa ?
 the news is spread via word of mouth .
 next week mid year exams for many schools .
 dont think will close schools .
 god bless singapore .
 not going to ask about the race of the student .
 block out the cecas  !
 last year not teenage mutant ninja turtle ,  this year &apos;s turtle is super mutant
 with school tio ,  cb 2 .
 0 is sure to come ,  but gahment will try to delay n not break the news for as long as they can to delay cb .
 bookmark for latest source
 wanna osa or pofma ,  let the telegram group die first
 yeah i think osa means confidential info kept within govt/civil servants .
 if even a secondary school student pubic hair just grown knows about it and informed ,  what osa ?
 provided the letter and whole thing is not a hoax
 after 10 pages and still no sauce and npnt .
 edmw is losing its potency
 u saw the letter too right ?
 ceca foreign trash destroy workplaces not enough now oso destroying schools  .
 sec 4 student tested positive .
 someone oredi share where can see the alleged “letter”
 using onion rings is it ?
 moi just voted a sticky  .
 can sic the source of the old snake in your abatar ?
 can luffymonkey add in  &apos;poon zui &apos; oso ?
 poon zui = spray water ?
 gotch any special edmw meaning boh ?
 ask ripplejack korkor .
 he always poon zui !
 moi think he uses it to mean ejaculation~

 tank kew very muchie~ 
 very de useful thread .
 edmw really have many lingo sia 
 wa me is welly welly honored ~
 edmw de korkors + zehzehs always create weird weird lingo de~  .
 where is ahpek lion name in kind peekpole 
 who invented tish ?
 such hours are common in fabs for a long time .
 shengsiong give 16mth bonus ntuc never .
 so ntuc workers stupid and lazy according to your logic .
 all these are no valid excuses  .
 if chiu have people shaking leg ,  then it shows chiu oredi have poor organisation that cannot deploy resources .
 u think every company can become top performing organisations just by breaking the backs of their workers ?
 bangla workers work the most ot ,  are our construction organisations world class ?
 (hint: one of the lowest productivity) .
 our healthcare workers are oredi pushed to the extreme ,  u think they can suka suka take leave ?
  (u think our healthcare management is world class ?
 sinkie management have proven to be one of the worst time and again
 singapore used to be top 2 fab in the world .
 csm and tsmc started in the same year and are the oni fabs
 tell me how many programmers in singapore get 150k in bonus .
 u tell me; silicon valley u throw a stone can hit .
 singapore how many ?
 you &apos;re not even from the field
 bad efficiency and optimization lead to waste of staffing resources ,  which is all management fault ,  not the workers .
 singapore management is the worst .
 250 million bonuses orntd  2 .
 5 million bonuses
 in before sinkies are happy if they can earn as much as team zai zai .
 as they become a grab driver or grab food rider .
 team zai zai is their inspiration
 can singapore with it &apos;s limited depth and breadth stand to gain much from biotech research ?
 u look at mrna vaccine ,  for it to be commercialised successfully is almost a miracle; even if katalin works here ,  her work could not be commercialised here .
 lee weiling was right about biotech in singapore
 sinkie gahment oni want instant result .
 not willing to take risk even though it might have great future many many years later .
 not forgetting the many failures and disappointments along the way .
 they cannot wait .
 chiu see their policy of importing foreign trash ,  chiu can see their mentality in doing things .
 want instant effort ,  instant outcome ,  no failures ,  no risks .
 oso 160 oni report success stories ,  then talk about the failures and disappointments along the way to achieve it .
 how can a nation innovate ?
 usa ,  even cheena do better than sinkieland in most aspects .
 oso ,  sinkieland gahment oni know how to use money to solve problem…want to control covid ,  just buy vaccine ,  not like usa where companies did r&d ,  even for many years ,  to achieve it
 no leh ,  few years back  ,  in this forum ,  when i tell people i’m from semiconductor industry ,  most of them commented that it’s sunset industry… .
 it is sunset cos singapore has lost the race some time back .
 the processes here are low margin low tech (but high cost); they cant compete and will slowly be phased out .
 of course ,  now that they say cheena and taiwan too risky ,  gf started some low tech ancient process here again
 no country outside of usa and europe can come out with solution for covid so quickly .
 what cheena did is just grow the covid virus and throw in the adjuvant ,  very primitive .
 it &apos;s oni how many countries want to do it or have the resources nia
 lol i used to be in this field .
 good programmers chiu telling me they all in cannot hit 150k ?
 good programmers easily 10k a month with 7-10 years experience .
 some i know even around 12-15k with 10 years experience .
 add in bonus (1-3 months) + project completion bonus + sign on bonus .
 chiu tell me cannot hit ?
 i doubt chiu in this line or chiu the average programmers ?
 average ones most probably 6-7k a month + bonus maybe 100k a year .
 still dont get it ,  tsmc capacity could not meet demand ,  orders overflow to so called no .
 3 ,  once tsmc cap catch up… it’s gg ,  as witnessed .
 it’s a total freak show ,  even strategic tech partner amd bailed out and loaded tsmc instead
 creative shot itself in the foot with poor product design ,  poor driver development ,  deceptive marketing .
 let it go oredi .
 last time tsmc come here ,  what happen ?
 all take business major ?
 true ,  go intel tio bullied by ceca .
 go samsung tio bullied by kimchi .
 go smic tio buliied by tiong and 996
 micron rotating shift .
 even your ram stick and ssd got ceca smell ,  ngl
 intel gen11 was done by ceca team and ceca ceo ,  and its their worst release in their history .
 all reviewers spit saliva on regressed gen11 i9 that has less core than gen10 .
 and that give amd the opportunity to break through the desktop market with ryzen3 .
 the point is ceca can oni copy and cannot compete or innovate .
 when faced with a strong opponent like tsmc ,  they just melts .
 infront of the world stage .
 just look at intel gpu unit headed by another ceca ,  which let nvidia free rein for the pass 10yrs .
 jensen huang just laughed .
 and wished intel keep that fellow there forever .
 intel gen 12 alder lake leh ?
 still the same right ?
 not to mention intel arc graphics is one by sacked radeon chief lol .
 radeon vega is a flop when nvidia come out with rtx 20 series
 kfc still better .
 prime supermarket sells a whole big chicken for oni $7 .
 better than kfc ?
 look like 51 wor  .
  she alot tatoo 1 la .
 on tv oso always show skin to make money .
 maybe cos she pray too much  .
 dats why look old 
 king kong has moved on n is with xiao xian now
 should make into a tw crime watch to reenact the story 
 xiao xian jin poor thing .
 hope king kong treat her well and dont break her heart like her ex-hubby
 think she &apos;s been made use  .
 since cant give birth
 look like coco lee at her current age lmao
 liddat face rape eh lor ?
 my cock cannot even stim .
 just that i cant remember the details much anymore .
 uncle part 2 continue 
 that kingkong guy gotch act with our local ex-showbabe hottie elaine yuki in a moobie last time wor  .
 i got piak by 5 ceca when 13
 i laped myself when i was 12 
 lape by your left and right hands not counted .
 that one classified as consensual lape .
 taiwanese bs alot huan
 she look like cheena wine
 that lorong i know .
 14 years ago i saw one guy langa .
 fly vertically up 3m oso .
 oso vomit blood .
 oso die on the spot .
 its not a coincidence
 hope the ceca customer didnt get too hungry waiting for his delivery
 metal vs your body .
 who correct oso the body lugi
 sho bui still flies 3m means is .
 great upbringing indeed
 how what update for this bro
 singapore is too crowded .
 they are on max 70km/hr oredi .
 bro ,  chiu must understand that the lives of the peasants are cheap as dirt .
 just import more people to replace him la
 sure bo ,  i see them always 90-100kmh on lane 1 and 2
 nowadays alot of driver drive like they rushing for time  .
 heighten alert phase 2 not much car still want to speed
 got insurance payout how much if die ?
 i seen a malay guy flung 5m by a van too last time .
 that one wasnt driver fault .
 the malay guy quarrel with gf ,  gf get on cab and left ,  he immediately run across the road onto oncoming traffic .
 xiam one lane ,  xiam 2 lane ,  3rd lane bang .
 at paya lebar quarters the bus stop facing the geylang serai open carpark there back when no paya lebar quarters around 1am .
 i heard a loud bang the screeching brakes and he was flung 5m .
 that time 7th month got a big tentage behind ,  all the sintua people (around 10) run out .
 so many people liao ,  i just watch from a distance lor .
 till today can remember the moaning sounds he made .
 gf ran out of the cab and started crying .
 but i guess too late liao .
 sunday morning ,  no car ,  they drive over 90 .
 easily overtake me .
 i hope the man can fully recover .
 how liao the guy
 and yes i do see them at that speed at 12 midnight but not in daylight hours la .
 then again ,  i am not always on the road .
 so ,  thats that .
 by right and by left lor  .
 believe many drivers in edmw can attest to if they do adhere to 70kmh most of the time
 too many cars ,  the gahment keep importing chopping trees ,  kepp build more concrete
 im feeling sad and bored la .
 cos ah i just saw i wasted alot of money but still haven get licence .
 anyone can layan me with this qns .
 did chiu take test ?
 how many times chiu failed ?
 want learn thing learn halfway .
 better dont even start .
 else waste time waste money waste effort oni .
 want to learn ,  one shot do it and clear it
 if fail ,  means fail better  .
 why give up ts ?
 find something to motivate yourself to get that license .
 personal experience ,  i take then halfway give up not cos i want to but waited for slot to take test until cmi then just didnt carry on .
 three years later when i more free take again then pass .
 but i lost 1k cause of this indecisiveness so learn dont waste money just go through w it man
 which stage r u at ?
 learning what now .
 take test fail 3times then no motivation continue .
 feel like im not suited for driving or maybe just really no luck .
 how much chiu spent oredi ?
 find more motivation to drive .
 imagine all the chiobus chiu will get with a car .
 that should help .
 dunno leh i see my parents can be happy without a car ,  at first i thought die die need car for family
 what causes u to fail ?
 dont be a loser .
 just do it once and for all and be done with it .
 chiu wont regret .
 or u take 3a fail ?
 actually pass or fail heng suay one .
 i oso dunno how i passed
 tats the end point ,  so close that u can smell the license liao~ jia chiu !
 just do one shot and pass
 this amount can go australia to take and tour the country at the same time
 not necessarily a bad thing 
 it means chiu are smelling the farts of nea
 the worst part isn’t the bs they say but that there are 60% ready to accept it as universal truth .
 really jin genius .
 no wonder miw always groom scholars .
 cos they can chut this type of lanjiao pattern .
 being dumb and naive oso not necessarily a bad thing
 like last time the psi went up so high that they have to average it out lol .
 tell u sniff one hour of bad air is ok one lol
 the volcano ash reach singapore oredi or not ?
 that could be worst .
 chao tar smell means not bad meh ?
 they gong jiao wei but people will stil believe rah
 this is true ,  when i fart nobody dies no matter how suffocating it is for that few seconds .
 singapore alot of sexperts jibber jabber words that dont make any sense .
 can disband nea  ?
 nea smoking me is the most healthy
 i know im not as smart as gahment people but im not exactly a retard .
 how this doesnt meant worsening air quality ?
 punch your face doesn’t mean i hate chiu  
 u go into a house with fire doesnt mean u get burnt .
 chiu caught your wife on bed with another man doesnt mean she &apos;s cheating .
 chiu penetrate a girl unwillingly doesnt mean it &apos;s rape .
 chiu didnt do well in your exam doesnt mean chiu wont get into good school .
 chiu short doesnt mean u cant play in nba .
 chiu fat doesnt mean chiu are not skinny
 i might be dumb but im not stupid !
 i know what my nose is telling me and definitely the air quality is no good !
 means ask chiu all to diam diam .
 she chose her life .
 tiagong he release oredi ,  thats why got dumped .
 maybe the truth is ,  he want to get dumped so he can piak more sinkie spg
 dont lai that ,  girls just want to have fun .
 she got the bf she chose ,  i dont want to hear any complaints
 why eveytime couples break up must delete all the photo they take together .
 do u mean produce better and more production
 ya and they are virgins too
 she break up after leaks ah ?
 why cannot look past that and remain as couple ?
 heard her hole is damn loose due to kena pumped multiple times by angmo(s)
 chrysan leak is one of the best leak since bwj/bjj/abby leak i think .
 her leak gotch many video of her playing w herself and oso got her saying she want fug chiu and she horrny
 her face very scary leh .
 if sic that i will kena bend
 still no proof and still got edmwer posting they saw some letter lol .
 hope pogba round these clowns up asap
 the group either doesnt exist or is a group with oni 1380 members not 25k as claimed .
 stocking up panadol cold and flu now !
 saw the letter liao .
 huai news media still not pick up ?
 priest share the link .
 similar templates to those letters from other schools that kena last year

 aiya oni emperors should try to live forever
 when your moral compass spoil liao ,  is like this one .
 cheena luv their melamine and fake milk magnum ice-cream~~
 u watch the channel is sponsored by falun gong de
 when wuhan broke out ,  they all dispersed to spread the love… chiu oredi know their style .
 always has been .
 as long as not deadly enough ,  no regulation .
 that cardboard bao very long ago have liao .
 i &apos;ll never eat at their road stalls if i were to ever even go there
 they rather reduce a few cents in cost and harm their customer get  known carcinogen
 i think it is not cos of the 5 , 000 years of culture .
 it is the ccp culture .
 cos its china
 no all but some deeply unscrupulous & selfish ones .
 sinkie pawn sinkie culture .
 its in the gene .
 nah ,  nothing compared to this scamdemic ii
 this pandemic oso from cheena knn .
 but funded by the us ?
 virus is not the problem but taking the people for a ride is .
  this is how it has turned into a scamdemic ii .
 probably is a very fast ordeal
 but xiao xian too engrossed with the religion that she &apos;s in .
 hope they can advance further into their relationship
 or very very long ordeal .
 may i rape chiu  ?
 seems to be getting worse… .
 how many going to gg tomorrow ?
 uhhhh pray hard
 tomorrow open gates to ceca  .
 before the delta variant ,  lesser deaths despite lesser to no vaccination in the country .
 after the delta variant  .
 seems to have increased deaths despite all the vaccination going on
 delta plus inbound to take more sinkie lives at the behest of pap

 copycat can be consider as an  &apos;art &apos; meh ?
 u fail during circuit or road ?
 maybe find a private instructor to address the specific areas .
 if u are the type who will have a car upon pass ,  then think of using the car for motivation .
 oso if u are doing manual now ,  maybe can consider change to auto ,  anyway now car mostly auto oso .
 gave up 3 times ,  2 times is car 1 time is motorcycle
 initially didnt sign up any school package ,  go direct to book basic theory .
 but i dont really have the motivation so didnt turn up for the test .
 few years later ,   bet with friend whoever gets license later to treat the other to a meal in any restaurant .
 eventually remember 1 thing during driving test .
 be calm and treat it as just another driving lesson ,  afterall ,  the tester will give chiu instruction on where to go ,  where to turn ,  and whatever he wants chiu to do .
 oh yar 1 more ,  be confident as thats what the tester is looking for .
 he certainly doesnt wanna release anyone whos not confident out to the main roads .
 thats why sinkie males are losers ,  have to kneel to ceca overlords .
 not nice - i like pan piano better .
 will the jap ever do jav
 u ask the piano
 this japanese meimei oso .
 very hot item in japan now .
 in before so fair i wanna zhut zhut 
 the naked routine is 
 her singing cmi 
 i wanna merry her
 chiu can merry someone that can play the piano and have naked piano instead of just bikini .
 its so darn comfortable this cotton tee .
 uniqlo etc all cannot fight
 poungol safra lor .
 last time i hate to wear ns t shirt recently reservist .
 buy the new one so shiok .
 even the trousers oso cotton de .
 now serve ns really shiok
 i &apos;ll never knw that feeling .
 under armour shirt is more comfortable
 i wear that tee i feel stupid liao .
 never in my whole life i die die oso wont wear that outside of ns/camp
 i won’t wear that shirt cos it brings bad memories .
 admin tee is more comfortable than uniqlo supima cotton tee ?
 if someone use the same material and remove the logo ,  make the t shirt into white ,  black ,  navy blue ,  i will wear it everyday everywhere
 u havent try the uniqlo airism yet .
 not the cotton version .
 why wear cotton materials shirt where it have difficultly of getting it dry when u sweat .
 it oso tend to be smelly .
  whatever i ran fast those joggers who wear saf admin tee at the stadium .
 they are the most smelliest .
 knn now gotch dri fit huans liao
 sign on la ,  can wear until chiu retire
 i bought that oso ,  still prefer saf green tee
 that one i thinks got the raisins pokey out
 i oso worked in semicon industry before ,  and i can say one thing for sure: semicon is booming ,  flourishing and growing ,  but in singapore ,  its 100% a sunset industry .
 the ruling party does not value engineers and stem industries ,  and does not carry out long term stem growth .
 blue collar skillsets are not valued in singapore .
 smart factory 4 .
 0 is just a desperate wayangmove to hype singapore up to automation ,  in reality ,  on the ground ,  most dont give a **** and do some wayang for the sake of wayang and giving edb something to talk about to maintain their relationship with pap .
 we still have ssmc ,  a sub child of tsmc .
 but its just a small tiny sub in singapore .
 everything for rental income .
 they see which one hype just as catchword for their hotel business .
 hub everything ,  cheap labour ,  ceca deal ,  singapore for everyone ,   all revolves around their hotel business .
 they never think sinkie sustainability and singapore durability
 very easy job leh all machine automated one .
 human just wear the suit see see look look only
 in case kumgong think tsmc engineer very low pay: .
 junior engineer is s$3 .
 principal engineer/manager s$5-6k/mth .
 not that low pay when u get 12-36mth bonus
 ya ,  thats the thing .
 lhl &apos;s administration revolves around short term fast gains rather tyan long term growth and sustainability ,  completely relying on the outside world .
 i left to set up my own thing .
 3 years on ,  my noa has tripled .
 its another story .
 150k in tech is nothing ,  almost all my friends who are in tech are getting close to this amount .
 i will say perhaps 3-4/10 of my tech friend is more than 150k  .
 insorlent/ppty agents hit millions commission dont say la .
 1 million leh ,  so easy to earn ?
 this isnt a very attractive pay in singapore for top talents .
 for taiwanese ,  thats quite decent .

 any pro knows which company in singapore oso can give such bonuses ?
 no need 36mths .
 18 months oso can .

 if chiu work in faang their stock rsu is worth just as much ,   maybe more than 36mth .
 wafer fab  ,  umc in singapore ,   oso giving out 12-18mth bonus
 aye cannot be coped  up frog in well in small little singapore world .
 in taiwan s$5k us equivalent to singapore 15k/mth .
 things in taiwan so good and so cheap and lifestyle choice so wide .
 singapore chiu earn 15-20k/mth your quality of life worse than those tsmc engineer who earn s$4k in taiwan .
 the average tsmc engineer can buy freehold good class bungalow .
 how many software engineer buy gcb in singapore ?
 all software engineer slaving away with no job protection from ceca ,  hire fire culture unlike tsmc work for life
 lol sgd4k in taiwan is better than 15k-20k in singapore ?

 enjoy yourself in taiwan !
 i know people who work in tsmc taiwan ,  their entry level grads earn 3k+sgd base .
 with 36months  (u can live like a king in hsinchu ,  12k is peanuts in sinkieland) .
 the average swes earn 15k a month ?
 lol u ask kumamon or davidktw lor how many swes they know earn that; they &apos;re working actively in the field .
 no doubt there &apos;re many cecas earning 15k in it here in sinkiland ,  for locals ?
 n u go bytedance sea see how many tiongs there vs sinkies lor lol .
 tech is another thing ,  this thread shows how sinkiland management is an absolute failure .
 u want compare with tech must as well compare with silicon valley .
 no wonder people say sinkies frog in a well
 haha ,  u kena f left and right .
 if dunno just   stfu ,  dont act smart .
 means pap no talent to see lucrative market .
 oni know how to pawn local increasing this tax increasing  that tax
 obviously chiu dont understand i meant quality  of life  .
 if chiu like low purchasing power in singapore ,   enjoy your 10 yr coe ,  inflated 99 yr property and being trapped in small island
 20k in singapore after taxes around 18k/mth .
 rent a bungalow for 5k/mth .
 buy a car 2k/mth .
 still have 10k a month to spend .
 10k a month can go overseas holiday once every 2-3 months .
 well must be kumgong to choose 4k in taiwan than 20k in singapore .
 chiu ownself wanna lower your standard of living can oredi ,  dont drag other down along with chiu 
 thats very good .
 envy should be the word .
 jesus ,  hope this guy recovers fast .
 what is the status of the rider ?
 wa geylang lorong 20 .
 who should have given way .
 motorcycle or minibus
 not just cars ,  too many people .
 our situation is fast becoming hong kong .
 is there any day in a week where there are no accs on the roads ?
 the motorcyclist was hit by the mini bus for some reason ,  and he fell three meters to the ground and vomited blood .
 the driver of the car who witnessed this scene stepped forward and wanted to hand over the photos of the scene to the police .
 the 67-year-old mini driver who caused the accident was arrested for negligent driving and serious injury .
 the car accident occurred at 5:06 pm yesterday (june 11) ,  near the junction of geylang road and geylang lane 20 .
  &apos;lianhe evening news &apos; received notifications from several readers that a car accident involving a motorcycle and a minibus occurred on the above road section ,  which caused serious congestion on the road section .
 a  &apos;lianhe evening news &apos; reporter rushed to the scene .
 liang (42 years old) said during an interview that he happened to park his car in a parking space on the side of the road .
 when he got off the car ,  he witnessed the mini bus driving in the lane ahead and crashed for some reason .
 ride backwards on the motorcycle on the left side of the bus .
  &apos;with a ‘touch’ ,  i witnessed the motorcyclist being thrown about three meters away .
 i immediately ran forward to check and found that he was lying on the ground ,  vomiting blood .
 u see similar van like these driving at 100 km/h on the expressway… thinking it is a sedan car .
 dual roles on the road .
 that time my kid feel down oso vomit blood .
 alot of blood .
 bring to doctor he said just lips got cut only
 colgate terminates collaboration with noc &apos;s sylvia chan after allegations of staff mistreatment .
 following the comments left on colgate &apos;s instagram page .
 colgate picked such a potty mouth for endorsements .

 dont really like her ,  too noisy
 song bo who this jhb voted for ?
 hoseh liao cannot smile with the white teeth anymore !
 even colgate cannot tahan her smelly cb mouth
 how much colgate pay her in the first place ?
 they probably made enough money to retire a few lifetimes over liao
 dettol should sponsor her so that she can wash that filthy mouth of hers .
 u walk with eyes closed ?
 help me open them ?
 i arent gg to donate my eyes
 rotan will help
 so what is your point again ?
 should be internal injuries .
 watch the video (if any) before making your assumptions
 chiu must be new here .
 people vomit blood liao .
 give chance la haha
 wear white talk bird get millions .
 hahah fking daft blank cheque issuing sinkies
 chiu all surprised by such a reply meh ?
 remember healthy people no need mask ?
 nea learning all the bird talk from certain ministars .
 i woke up with sore throat yesterday and bloodied phlegm .
 really not bad thing ?
 i re-read again and the sentence have worsening air quality and haze in the phrase ,  probably they disagree with the 2nd part citing have other sources local or foreign blah blah ,  then went on to intro their legendary psi and pm2 .
 free rider spotted .
 ponding lot is not flooding .
 oso mean water look milky ,  but water is clean
 dafug are they saying .
 they think people is stupid ?
 particle count in the aur increases ,  especially those pm 2 .
 5 not a health hazard ?
 it just means certain odour causing particles are not considered as pollutants .
 wearing condom during sex oso considered not cheating ,  dunno why my ex got so upset about this
 so means chiu if go in toilet ,  then got heavy sai smell ,  the air is still healthy just that is smelly only
 can try to get air purifier ,  helps alot and quite cheap also
 everyday gahment agencies talking rubbish to avoid real problems is their kpi is it ?
 same metaphor as healthy dunnid wear mask .
 sounds similar to .
  &apos;the increase in cases is not due to imported covid cases &apos;
 delta is ~2x transmission rate ,  ~2x deadliness ,  less evasive with less obvious symptoms and more standard flu like symptoms before things turn real bad ,  and oso affect younger population alot more than original strains .
 meanwhile we opening door wide wide … don’t know what to say…
 sup sup water to oyk .
 now 7th month ,  sure many bros looking to bring them along .
 wish them well .
 oyk be still praying
 tomorrow open flood gate big big .
 this is the worrying part .
  we control delta here but bring in more .
 and delta can infect people with vaccination .
  so those vaccinated coming in might have delta .
 thats why all inbound travellers are tested and quarantined ,  unless they come from countries considered low risk (not india) .
 weren &apos;t we oredi doing this  ?
  virus still comes in .
  and once escape ,  it will spread quickly .
 eh hello ,  u think our icu oni cater for covid patients ah ?
 learn to live with the virus .
 learn ,  chiu must    
 this is farking crazy and yet more c guys on the way soon ?
 oyk did mention 1000 icu beds set aside for covid patients .
 there are oso currently 10 patients in critical condition in the intensive care unit (icu) ,  and a total of 35 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation .
 the last time the number of icu cases reached the double digits was in may 2020 .
 seven of these 45 cases are fully vaccinated ,  of which five require oxygen supplementation while two required icu care ,  as they have underlying medical conditions .
 yes ,  it is not foolproof .
 but it does significantly reduce spread if we catch such cases in quarantine .
 even if it was foolproof ,  delta may still come in via other means like foreign fishermen delivering produce to our fishery port ,  which was the suspected cause of the fishery port cluster .
 thats why we need vaccination as an additional measure to border control .
 must thks for speed up herd immunity
 later import ceca by the thousands ,  all come in spread delta variant ,  by then 1k icu bed enough ?
 confirm majority unvaxxed
 must find the source .
 dunno isit import strain
 dunnid to act helpful .
 no such thing as skool clusters kays .
 i oredi warn my kids to avoid all their ahneh classmates at all costs ,  a week+ ago .
 no need tiagong liao .
 last year got school kena ,  but no cluster in the school .
 let &apos;s see this time have or not .
 this indian strain quite satki  .
 covid no ezlink ,  cannot take bas/mtr/teksi
 didnt spread to others .
 so if true then ts share to warn people oso cannotch  ?
 the ministry of education (moe) said that edgefield secondary school (efss) will shift to home-based learning (hbl) next week ,  after one of its students tested positive for covid on friday (april 30) .
 wow it is real .
 then kids dont go school must set liao .
 dont repeat same mistakes
 incubation period is longer than 14 days liao .
 remember last year oky said school is the safest worh      .
 ong: no need to suspend school with enhanced measures
 alrdy reported in st alongside the old lady covid mati case .
 15 yo girl student .
 entire school go on hbl from 4-7 may
 so fast situation turned bad
 look at all the dumb jokers invoking osa .
 this is the perfect example of the chilling effect .
 pofma yes ,  maybe .
 5000 years of civilisation leads them to this .
 i still cant believe no consequences to cheena .
 us is stupid for thinking cheena can do any real work .
 dr fauci and shi zhengli .
 this 2 people roh .
 cheena is stupid to do the dirty work for the us .
  people are dying now and suffering from long covid in the us .
 us oso sama sama .
 one brudder one sister
 i havent see us making fake eggs and baby powder ,  comrade .
 prc started in 1949 .
 cultural revolution started in 1966 .
 their 5000 years of culture was reformatted .
 maybe n0t ,  but they have tons of disgusting practices too .
 in the end all e same 
 not just in us .
 it is the entire world .
 cheena needs to pay la .
 the problem with cheena is ,  if they didnt cover up ,  covid could have been stopped .
 harnor harnor ,  actually chinese people mostly good hearted 1 ,  until the ccp come ,  now so cek ark until their own people oso think chinese people are cek ark .
 like u can google for it
 in cheena ,  every day is a competition .
 so even for businesses they &apos;ve to come up with innovative ideas to earn a stable income .
 knn ,  chiu say 1 then dont provide .
  &apos;kill off the small people around chiu and you &apos;ll emerge the winner .
  &apos; - confucius from ccp &apos;s records .
 yea ,  the ccp uses the social credit system to oso turn the people against themselves and give rewards to those who tell on each other creating a very distrusting and self serving culture .
 so there are alot who dont mind throwing each other under the bus to gain benefits to themselves
 nonsense roh ,  everywhere in this  world oso competitive .
 oni in cheena ,  they make fake baby powder and egg with no yolk !
 cek ark till cannot cek ark liao la !
 nah ,  it &apos;s a plan .
 phase 1 is no wear mask .
 phase 2 is jab and safe .
 phase 3 is everyone will be infected .
 phase 3 is jab and be infected .
 when the parents fought hard to kick kmt out to replace it with mzd and now eventually xjp ,  of course the children will be damn sianz .
 now they cant even get taiwan pr .
 in before ccp supporters say this is oso fake video  
 i think bbfa can match the unkle in the blue t shirt and shorts bah
 based on 2 pics ?
 the men dressing still look like chao sinkie 
 bbfa still cannot match cos they will either wear slippers or saf sandals .
 i rather see what radish sister will wear 
 guy dressing still look like ****
 chao sinkies bbfas edmwers typical low ses look .
 green army tee  .
 black bkk shorts .
 fake chatuchak haivanas slippers .
 hair not long but wear guniang hairband  .
 east asia people dress to kill .
 singapore people dress to chill
 well what do chiu expect from the low end stock ?
 not like the atas cecas
 hkg ladies tend to take pride in their dressing .
 the ah peks however dress the same as singapore ah peks .
 maybe they have a secret ash pek dress code .
 their humidity not as bad
 singapore oso have people wear liddat la .
 all still canot fight jippun &apos;s tokyo people dressing
 orchard  ,  funan  ,  see so many people in like shorts and slippers .
 i went in summer before .
 holy **** it was damn hot .
 worse than singapore .
 cos ft are cheaper faster better but dont commit more crime .
 means in terms of crime divide by salary ,  sinkies are worse .
 so sinkies must put high pay when hunting for job .
 anyone got pictures of her feet or armpits ?
 lol jhb age very badly huan .
 very fast will look chao lao and become irrelevant lol
 she need to find new collaborator .
 maybe those companies that sell industrial acid for cleaning stuff

 upz for this useful thread .
 many lost their jobs due to ft ,  covid ,  less tech savvy mindset and lastly is aging .
 hope gahment can see all these issues and ensure sinkie first mindset and policy .
 there is shortage of mini bus and delivery van drivers .
 better check his license and screen for illegal employment .
 can someone tell if that is a large ebike or a small motorcycle ?
 it looks small to be a motorcycle ,  and i did see such ebikes that look almost like motorcycles before .
 ban some certain models maybe ?
 it &apos;s something like 3 litres turbo diesel engine ?
 at least limit the speed lor ,  heavy vehicles have speed limiter why not these light goods vehicles ?
 or bring back the blinker on the roof of such vehicles .
 used to have but dunno why remove
 some of them open 1 dollar company so that they can buy van and use it like their personal transport .
 somemore topup diesel cheaper than petrol .
 that explains why the van can bodykit ,  lowered with sports rims .
 cos not use for cargo delivery and more for personal use  .
 smart to exploit this loophole ,  fark lta for not clamping down on such practices
 any update on this rider ?
 did the guy survive ?
 i hope he did .
 lets pray for him
 my poly friend oredi told me about it 15 years back .
 but not everyone doing it cos driving van not as satki as driving sedan or hatchback .
 some van drive very fast nowaday .
 that day was at lane 1 driving 100kmh .
 van was tailgating like mad .
 have to give way to him
 it could be either serious or not serious 
 saf vehicles oredi seen before can install switch to bypass .
 dont even need to talk abt commercial vehicles .
 mini bus usually drove by jhk .
 they like to speed huan 
 but very practical .
 can go places can use to buy bulky items
 just out yourself in his shoes .
 no money ,  making ends meet .
 now chiu tio buang .
 cant pay for bills  .
 what will the future holds for this family ?
 these riders sometimes damn dangerous zoom here and there by the way pedestrian and road
 its not worth it .
 not alot of people do it .
 high road tax .
 i dont have to ask them or answer chiu ,  i literally know people who earn this amount .
 i dunno whats your point of replying me or saying all those unrelated things .
 chiu happy can oredi bro  
 i know of cecas and tiongs in the local tech scene earning 15k .
 oni a small handful .
 there are many local ppty agents earning more than 20k easily .
 what &apos;s your point ?
 that tsmc engineers are worthless compared to your local tech friends ?
 dat your local tech friends worthless compared to cecas and ppty agents ?
 and you &apos;re worthless and mediocre compared to your peeh ah peeh ministar ?
 the whole tsmc with local taiwanese got 36mth bonus .
 how many (local workers) bytedance or shopee or grab earning 20k ?
 what property agent what tiong what cecas ?
 chiu maybe wanna check in imh ?
 good for them lor
 i agree with chiu .
 most of my swe friends are earning 15k easily and they are all locals .
 u still think that cecas are low wage banglah workers ?
 continue to live in your bubble .
 there are many ppty agents ,  those in the lower tier dont earn much ,  those in your upper tier easily earn more than 20k (ok ,  not all are sinkie citizens) .
 it &apos;s ok ,  ur &apos;e a sinkie ,  continue to live as a kumgong frog in a well bah
 locals earning 15k as swes are common .
 i know of at least 10 friends who are swes earning that amount ,  if not more .
 after chiu expand your social circle and stop being a bbfa ,  .
 u can find 100 ceca and ahtiong earning >15k compared to your 10 local friends .
 36mth bonus in tsmc is just average ,  there are better ones who will get 42-48mths bonus
 i &apos;ve always been working in tech mncs .
 i am in tech myself ,  obviously i know .
 so which tech mnc u working in ?
 u think the majority of high earners in sea are sinkies ?
 hello chiu ok or not ?
 this thread is a bait by quitters like ts who is trying to make sinkies pawn each other .
 chiu are assuming that my social circle is as degenerate as yours .
 just cos chiu are not getting paid half as much as others doesnt mean high earning sinkies dont exist .
 maybe chiu should expand your social circle instead .
 so u mean knowing cecas and ahtiongs who are high earners is degenerate ?
 continue to be a sad froggo in your well bah;  if u &apos;re earning 15k per month as swe ,  good for u .
 if you &apos;re not ,  dont come here kpkb ,  go and learn upgrade your skills to keep up with ceca bah .
 there are some good local swes ,  but there are many many more talented cecas (despite what hwz says) .
 y do u think sinkiland need to bring in cecas to power tech economy if locals are good ?
 (u havent shared which tech  &apos;mnc &apos; u &apos;re in where there are many more talented local swes than cecas and ats)
 obviously i earn more than 15k .
 in fact i dunno anyone in tech that doesnt ,  so no i dont think i need further upgrades to reach this level .
 oso ,  chiu have a comprehension issue .
 when on earth did i say that there are more local swes than foreigners ,  and that it is in my company ?
 maybe thats why you &apos;re not earning half as much as we do .
 besides ,  chiu are the one who is kpkbing not me .
 im just stating facts but no you &apos;re the one being sour and claim that most sinkie swes dont earn that amount .
 they really have comprehension issues .
 keep bringing up assumptions and irrelevant topics which make zero sense
 can share which sinkieland company you &apos;re from ?
 seems like a jiak liao bee company that hires someone like chiu  .
 i might be a grabfood rider ,  but based on your degenerate language and thinking u &apos;re far away from the standards of cecas and ahtiong lol .
 sad (continue to earn 15k while u still can  )
 too much jealousy and bitterness pent up over the years can make some go crazy and be incoherent .
 surprised he didnt use lakhs and crores .
 wa jinjia lookalike with jay chou trademark biker jacket
 jj cannot leh lol
 i is agree n believe
 they should stop treating people as idiots .
 same goes to healthy no need wear mask .
 nea is a disgrace
 no la ,  it just means chiu are gonna die earlier ,  as chiu take up less oxygen ,  of course the air quality improve .
 when they take the air from last 24 hours to indicate air quality .
 chiu know is all csb liao .
 does the air quality from 24 hours ago matter ?
 lu lai lu jialat public service .
 pap wansui and sinkies jiak sai .
 it &apos;s like saying your girlfriend left your cos chiu are perfect .
 as long as it can make the report look good .
 like the teochew saying  .
 sit where the cool wind blows
 another pap logic:  .
 mrt reliability has improved as breakdown increases .
 dont worry minister up in the ivory tower watch your safety .
  remember social distancing and wash hand
 with all these done so far ,  we recently saw a burst in cases .
  and it will happen again .
 the quarantined part ,  they intend to do away soon if fully vaccinated .
 use india produced vaccine fully vaccinate one banned here
 the numbers will drop once the people in the icu die .
 thank chiu jinx ong ye kung for making me feel less guilty over dead sinkies .
 watch the number rise from today .
 floodgates reopen for the importers to come in .
 vaccinated will be immuned
 icu cases increased suddenly just after their desperate narrative for vaccine .
 what are the other high risk countries for fake vax cert  .
 besides the obvious one
 cecapura oh cecapura
 doesnt matter ,  he soon eat back his words
 its good ,  let all the anti vaxxers stay at home with the tsunami of covid pp coming .

 if it &apos;s embargoed press release ,  element of osa stronger
 u know what is pofma or not ?
 protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act .
 was it the incident fake ?
 but considering this case ,  it involves a whole school .
 parents would have been notified ,  they have no obligation to keep it confidential .
 so it will be pofma at most it &apos;s fake news
 please read up osa first dude
 wlwlsmdwl…just announce cb 2 .

 thats why a lots of peoples avoid foods from cheena .
 got people says wants to retire in cheena which i think looks more like commits suicide to me .
 singapore politicians not far off .
 they are oredi here .
 they going to say it is us fault .
 cek ark people use social credit system to push each other under the bus ?
 really is cek ark culture .
 they dont believe in any religion since the culture revolution ,  oni money can motivate them .
 taiwan is real cheena ?
 can we make it happen ?
 5000 years of history
 education that emphasize oni to glorify the party ,  lack of freedom in religion ,  destruction of ancient wisdom and culture .
 chinese people all over the world ,  oni mainland chinese are this cek ark .
 chiu think religion can help them meh ?
 chinese cheat chinese .
 harnor harnor ,  mainland chinese people dont treat each other as human beings ,  that is why do this kind of cek ark stuff .
 see liao throw chinese people face oni .
 it still depends on the education and upbringing ,  they is like always trying their luck to avoid responsibilities .
 usually when chiu go other countries ,  we is follow the local regulations and culture .
 for them and most of the other ft ,  they is think they can enforce their own rules and culture in other countries .
 haiz nothing new anything can turn a profit at the expense of others ,  u can count on them to do it
 cos those little pinky and ccp-cock holsters  think cheena is big fark la .
 they got 1 billion population so can bully other small countries .
 always liddat 1 ,  last tiem cheena oso riddat ,  remember 100 years of humiliation ?
 siao lang many in the ccp ,  their religion is the party .
 chiu think how long will it take for the mainland chinese to finally realize they are in hell ?
 profits above people .
 cannot provide means dont have lor .
 at least u provided a video that has video evidences and research being done that can be corroborated  .
 ccp on the other hand can fabricate false scientists like wilson edwards and force people to say certain scripts and tio caught only
 to spite australia dont buy australia coal .
 rather freeze cheena people in coming winter and make them eat cold food and trapped in elevators .
 to spite usa artificially lower carbon emissions so that usa can once again be the worlds biggest carbon emitter ,  people of cheena can go eat cold food and endure cold winter and trapped in elevators and climb their sky scraper apartments  .
 the great emperor winnie xi jin poo aspires the great cheena of old .
 oppress the people with long winters like the long march of old and the great winter forward like the great leap forward where people suffer for the greater good of the emperor for life .
 wu maos please go to cheena to delight in the ways of your new emperor who aspires to be greater than mao who had purged his father in the great purge of mao so now the new emperor wants to repeat history and do the same !
 long live the emperor of cheena .
 long may his reign be like qin shi huang and like cao cao his descendants bear the wrath of his actions !
 i dunno why they have to be so cek ark .
 they keep doing cover ups la ,  propaganda la ,  all these nonsense ,  thinking everyone is dumb riddat .

 mandatory inspection every 2 weeks .
 since they like to speed like f1 racer might as well make things hard for them
 in jp ,  japanese people almost always return the supermarket trolley after use .
  infact ,  they have little need for the trolley as purchases are made over several days .
 in singapore ,  is it true that the ones who dont return trolley from sheng siong or fair price are usually the lower ses from hdb 2-3 or 4 room flat ,  without cars  ?
 instead of purchasing their groceries over several days ,  they buy 1 big family worth of groceries filled to the brim of the trolley .
  after pushing to their hdb block ,  they are too lazy to return the trolley and abandoned these at the void decks .
  last time ,  i observed the 5 room flat ,  condos or landed properties folks oni use the trolley till the carpark .
  not all return the trolley back to the supermarket from the carpark .
  unlike the 2-4 rooms ,  they dont push the trolley to their condos or landed property since they have cars .
 is this cultural differences or social class differences ?
  some sinkies are very inconsiderate .
 instead of 1 dollar coin .
 change it to insert ic to use trolley .
 see they want to return or not
 we sinkies are still living in the 90s golden era and still keeps our coolie mindset .
 moi paids millions for the condos still wans mois to returns trolleys for huats !
 evens moi maids duns hvs the times for thats !
 the bulk buy mentality i believe is from older gens .
 dont understand why oso .
 some sort of hoarding mental illness
 not when chiu have more than 45% of foreigners here in singapore .
 it will be unthinkable for the japanese , and the virtue of reigi .
 change the trolley to those drag on the floor type .
 confirm nobody will be interested to steal
 coming from shady huts to high rise
 ic scanning technology oredi existing for disbursing of masks ,  sanitisers ,  etc .
 make ic scan instead of $1 to borrow trolley .
  if trolley not returned and abandoned in void deck ,  automatically treat it as a stolen goods case .
  akin to library books loan and return .
 interestingly ,  trolley theft and abandonment does not happen to cold storage or isetan .
 cuplrits must be low ses with big nucleus extended families .
  or they run a food business in their hdb flat .
 tbh ,  u dont sound like an swe .

 i thought is those lodged inside somewhere very long de sai .
 the most enjoyable thing in life is sitting in a plush luxurious king sized bed ,  fully naked ,  having your cock sucked by a chio bu ,  being fed by another chio bu ,  and resting your head on another e cup chio bu .
 black poo can mean old blood that mixed with poo ,  good to check with dr .
 this i agree too .
 for moi when pika pika with chio bu ,  and after the act when see them lay down exhausted in satisfaction make moi happy 
 u  must be suffering from serious constipations .
 1 of my most enjoyable things is to have an uninterrupted sleep of 7-8 hrs and wake up naturally feeling refreshed

 one enjoyable thing to do in life is to do anything without worrying about money

 separately ,  the ministry of education (moe) said that edgefield secondary school will shift to home-based learning (hbl) next week ,  after one of its students tested positive for covid on friday (april 30) .
 moe said on saturday the student was last in school on thursday ,  april 29 ,  with acute respiratory infection symptoms ,  and had immediately consulted a doctor .
 students ,  staff and external vendors who had been in close contact with the student will be placed under quarantine ,  and the school premises will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected ,  said the ministry .
 all other students ,  staff and external vendors will need to be swabbed for the coronavirus .
 moe said the move to full hbl from may 4 to may 7 is cos it would take some time to complete and receive the results of the covid swab tests .
  &apos;during the week ,  edgefield secondary school will continue to provide instruction and support for its students both online and using hardcopy materials ,  so that learning continues uninterrupted .
 teachers will oso keep in regular contact with students and parents ,  &apos; said moe .
 it added:  &apos;pending their test results ,  all those involved in the edgefield secondary school covid swab testing should oso minimise contact with others and avoid crowded places as a precautionary measure .
 now the question is .
 where she get covid from .
 wa those kids very cham ,  have to poke nose
 actually most of people put guard off partially .
 my colleague oso unwell go office .
 just heng that its not covid .
 yup where she kena from siol .
 all edgefield students are shouting yahoo .

 more like they cry than yahoo

 so moi can avoid 
 just how much does ts gamble one ah ?
 this is like the 5th thread or something that he create for monday &apos;s draw .

 if i win 1st prize tomorrow i will send u a flower every week for your entire life 
 and yet someone wins eventually .
 wont be ts tho cause its me .
 oredi got one say sponsored by flg .
 if chiu are constantly cold and hungry .
 chiu dont think about freedom or society .
 xi is just using north korea tactics .
 communists are liddat .
 actually not just cheena ,  even india and philippine oso same .
 they doesnt respect the local authority and always think they are street smart enough to get away with things .
 it is not that we are racist and bias against them ,  we always welcome those who follow our regulations and respect our culture .
 chiu can see that it had become a social issues in their country that nobody dare to help those old people who had fallen down ,  and what &apos;s worst is that a lorry driver can even back up his vehicle to run over young kid again to ensure her death so that he will oni be jail and fine for murder instead of paying for her life expenses if she become handicap .
 karma will always come back to haunt them and they will always get the punishment they deserve .
 i saw that beedio oso !
 super cek ark until cannot liao .
 rapeland is rape + scams .
 bananaland is drugs + pride ?
 sibei heng i live in singapore ,  if not oso can become cek ark like them .
 yea and oso wonder why this kind of stuff even need to fake .
 why egg yoke oso must fake .
 why must mix cardboard into mugworth .
 how can this ever be worth the harm it is causing people  .
 it &apos;s quite sad but their gahment is honestly incompetent at managing this and rather prefer to suppress all the people who speak out instead of solving the problem  .
 and the ccpibs that attempt to throw shade at this is oso very pitiable that they can throw away their conscience and try to defend the ccp and their lack of action .
 they really just want the chinese people to be even more despised not just by others ,  but even among themselves .
 we have to do our part and make it clear we do not support such incompetence and lack of accountability in our country and not let the ccpibs anyhow relate as if we are the same as them and drag us through the mud
 its the hallmark of communist and authoritarian regimes .
 the ideal state is where the people are busy pwning each other and breathing down each other &apos;s necks such that the citizenry will be too distrustful and spiteful of each other to band up and rise/revolt against the regime , 
 cheena is really competitive .
 to beat competition ,  they need to be as self-centred as possible .
 that includes making fake baby powder and many other fake products .
 dont compare their competitiveness to singapore .
 i &apos;d say singapore &apos;s competiveness is still average compared to cheena .
 if chiu hung out with many different people from cheena every day for more than 5 years like i did ,  chiu would understand my point .
 if chiu say that im giving them an excuse to be self-centred ,  then you &apos;re wrong .
 i dont like being around ahtiongs for many reasons and this is one of them .
 the problem with ccp is they are all run by weak people .
 oni the weak are that power-hungry .
 the unintended consequences of ccp .
 they created a culture of spiritual bankruptcy and they have forgotten their history .
 no religion and no human values .
 i feel ashamed to be chinese cos of cheena .
 they oredi dragged the chinese image into the mud .
 when i was visiting taiwan in a tour group back in 2014 .
 talking to taiwanese people ,  every time i tell them  &apos;i am from singapore .
  &apos; chiu can see their eyes light up and become friendly with chiu .
 chiu might think this is just a taiwan phenomenon .
 it is the same everywhere .
 if they know where singapore is ,  they breathe a sigh of relief .
 every country hates mainland chinese tourists ,  everywhere they go is destructive and disruptive .
 being competitive is not a good excuse .
 chiu look at us silicon valley .
 trillion with a t ,  trillions of dollars made there by a few individuals .
 chiu dont see them do these kinds of uncouth and inhumane types of actions .
 i saw beedio too !
 these people are all over the world .
 last time taiwan oso many such cases
 yeah ,  alot of cek ark people all over the world but china &apos;s cek ark is really the pinnacle of cek ark .
 fake baby powder sia !
 sibei gao lat !
 chiu happy can liao
 5000 yrs of moral compass oredi destroyed in one revolution mah .

 tiongs are nowhere near the pinnacle .
 angmos are the ultimate .
 chiu take fiber supplement ?
 what brand to recommend ?
 i dont take supplement .
 i eat veggies and fruits everyday
 i dont usually give advice on the internet but my 2 cents: .
 perhaps dont build your life around faeces ?
 just a thought .
 i eat theratears supplements  .
 most enjoyable is to see your bank account got 1 billion dollars  .
 nobody come and disturb chiu .
 no whatapp ,  no email ,  no phone calls .
 that is good enough .
 plus many many $$$ to spend everyday .
 no illness ,  no pain .
 angmo and ceca expats rent from sinkie landlords ,  spend money on certain things and contribute to our economy  .
 chinese and indons come here to speculate and buy properties and drive up prices .
 oni property agents benefit from them
 cos of our girls .
 then again it &apos;s true these indo and chinese too .
 but hopefully they get taxxed somehow .
 their expenditure is good but they are probably sometimes lawless
 chiu conveniently left out the part about jobs
 they generate jobs .
 well ,  when your interests are aligned with national interests ,  of course winners praise papaya team more than their parents !
 and winners have more time to deal with more money making issues at hand than getting cheap thrills from edmw-ers .
 but im not too sure he will agree with the  &apos;gained fame for banning ppl &apos; part~

 tourist coming here expect to drink and party at zouk or ktv yo
 scully tonight shoot up over 1k plus how ?
 my excel sheet trend says roi returns is good ,  we will dip soon
 it &apos;ll definitely shoot above 1 .
 cos day before was sunday and lab never work so lesser case on monday cos of the backlog i feel .
 today confirm shoot higher than sunday
 maybe cos many people actually believe in self isolating after art instead of going for pcr swap sho case count drops cos art results is notch counted in daily case tally .
 raging stock market oso need some small corrections before advancing higher  .
 our ministers said before .
 more cases cos of more testing .
 to lessen the cases ,  sinkies should test less
 that is for sunday count ,  today chiu see .
 if higher then 1 , 000 then the situation hasn &apos;t changed .
 i feel mrna vaxxers are reading and incubating the variants but mostly not showing symptoms and never actually recover ,  they just spread to those who are more vulnerable to the virus .
 not much of a drop .
 if today go back up then it meant nth
 mr covid probably drunk yesterday thats why very low
 these few days should go high seem many location are affected including school .
 everywhere hard to find test kits .
 got official test = official case number to report .
 no official test = no official case number to report .
 test kit flying off the shelves !
 maybe moh oso run out of pcr test kits .
 limit to 1k tests per day .
 rest please self isolate at home and assume chiu have recovered after 3 days ,  no need to add to the statistics .
 more like art and massage kick in lol
 can guam tahan a few  ?
 does cheena have patriot missile defence system / iron dome  ?
 scmp anti cheena bias as usual .
 nothing to see here .
 scmp is fully owned by alibaba
 us has 5 , 500 nuclear weapons ,  cheena has 350 .
 not sure if it &apos;s a good idea .
 doesnt matter who is bias ,  nuclear retaliation is a lose lose situation .
 maybe winnie and trump folks dont really understand the aftermath of a nuclear strike .
 always had to pay for the stupidity of others .
 life is indeed unfair
 scmp is ok &apos;ed by ccp .
 no one with a sound mind will dare to fire a nuke weapon .
 tw got pave paws ,  korea got thaad ,  how to launch ?
 i think can practically throw this scmp to the drain .
 i think chinese leaders are just terrible strategic thinkers .
 there is little benefit in adopting a no first use stance unilaterally .
 scmp is just a licensed run dog of that fire-movement to the rear nation ,  same with many angmo worshippers on this island and in asia .
 its hard to see them winning no matter what they do .
  usa too far ahead of the pack liao .
 they control both the might and the money system .
 dunnid negotiate .
 just shoot nuke into xixiaoxiao head
 let ccp fire first ok .
 biden too dumb to react anyway .
 hawker profits ,  cos of their low margins ,  hover around 12 to 15 per cent .
 if cant earn then close down lor .
 if wana raise prices then raise lor .
 why must make us believe its not profitable when we dont care ?
 average people just buy the cheapest and tastiest hawker food they can find
 starting an app is free ?
 hosting a series of cloud services is free ?
 no one asking the hawkers to fully absorb the 30%……
 never say them mention 37% cpf .
 never hear the hawkers mentioned the rental wavier for this month
 where the fark this idiot got his 12-15% margin from ?
 plugged out from thin air ?
 most hawkers &apos; gross margin is around 50% of selling price .
 nett margin depends mainly on rent and to a lesser extent ,  other overheads
 actually online delivery price is oredi higher than on site price .
 cos gahmen is trying to push them to go digital .
 pipe dreams from paper skolars in aircon offices out of touch with the ground as usual
 they want to tax  &apos;properly &apos;  .
 nowadays rental is not cheap & with squeezing from delivery platform .
 think hawkers not really earning much .
 singapore just too expensive to do business .
 this guy is barking up the wrong tree .
 can ask him diam diam or not ?
 he probably looking at average net profit margin .
 want use app mai kbkp .
 cannot afford to use ownself go take order through phone ownself go deliver lor
 then change business to higher  .
 profit margin la .
 did seetoh not realise that most hawkers pass on the 30% commission to consumers in the form of higher prices ?
 most if not all of the hawker food prices i see on delivery apps are marked up 30-40+% .
 just don’t use delivery apps  .
 we did it for decades so why can’t continue ?
 it is not like grab or foodpanda provided some revolutionary app that made our lives better .
 they are lousy .
 i dont believe oso .
 hawker charge extra 50c for dabao people oredi umbrage ++

 wait horse face .
 iso 9001 certified ky .
 looks like pika &apos;s boob jacket .
 looks too perfect .
 show face first .
 and proof is not ladyboy .
 please show your excel sheet .
 see what duration did chiu use  .
 winnie the pooh big fan of mao &apos;s little red book .
 mao destroyed cheena intellects and their knowledge books during cultural revolution .
 that time cheena regressed
 i think the angmo are less cek ark ,  except maybe before 2000s .
 mk ultra anyone ?
 i wont compare them to the us .
 the us is inhumane in other ways ,  but they do know how to cover it up and make themselves look good .
 if cheena is a kind country ,  they wouldnt even be threatening other countries all the time .
 paggro is their tm .
 even their people say the same thing ,  that cheena uses verbal threats to get things their way ,  not through war .
 at times their people are decent indeed when it comes to social activities ,  but when they need to get things done or get their way ,  they arent going to care about chiu getting hurt as long as they get what what they need .
 thats why if chiu ever live in cheena ,  you &apos;ve to keep being alert 24/7 .
 they frame themselves as a nation that has progressed quickly - yes indeed ,  but mostly oni in terms of technology .
 in the cities ,  there are still many slums where some houses look wrecked and have severely dented windows and doors that can be kicked down easily .
 i thought that cheena has progressed from this stage of poverty and didnt expect to see that in the cities .
 to avoid being part of those slums ,  all of those cheena students study all day long in libraries .
 chiu will see them filling up the entire library from opening hours to closing hours just to make sure that they can score better than their peers .
 this is how they are brought up to be selfish ,  self-centred and competitive since they try so hard not to live that slum life .
 they killed off the rich ,  those rich people tend to be smart people .
 dont forget they beat and kill those who are land owners .
 force farming and agriculture ,  caused famine and cannibalism .
 i dont think any mainland chinese learned any of these .
 diverting the issue/blame doesnt make the world see tiongs in a better light .
 thats the problem with your kind of people ,  forever wont die die admit to mistakes and push blame around .
 what chiu describe is happening everywhere ,  not just in cheena .
 the middle class is terrified of the poor .
 india &apos;s slums are even worse than china &apos;s .
 cheena went wrong when they decided to sacrifice human values and humans live ,  for technological progress .
 a cheena reform will require at least 50 years to fix what the ccp have broken .
 maybe help control over population ,  could be a policy .
 everytime cheena did something wrong ,  will blame us .
 cheena say covid is from us .
 blame it to italy ,  didnt work .
 now they blame it to india .
 i think the world should come together ,  clean house liao ,  cheena take out for good la .
 it really helps when i tell others i am not  a fking cheena chinese when i in oveesea
 harnor ,  chinese image destroyed oredi !
 it &apos;s not everywhere .
 cheena and india are more of the sb jialat ones .
 some other countries are still living better lives .
 at least i &apos;ve lived in places where the welfare is so much better and less competitive to the point where chiu dunnid to work and chiu can lepak since the gahment will just give chiu money for free every month .
 wipe out ccp first .
 i havent heard any cheena chinese speak up about their severely corrupted governance .
 they themselves know about this problem ,  but they cant change cos they are more kiasi than us .
  &apos;if everybody do ,  i will oso have to do &apos; attitude .
 if chiu give them a luxurious apartment in exchange of harming their best friend ,  most will sacrifice the friendship .
 i go order the half boiled eggs bread set at the coffeeshop near my house ,  chiu know what anot ?
 the cheena woman who happens to tend the stall ,  keep creating communication error and stop me from changing my drink to ice milo .
 i’m like wtf chiu talking about even though my chinese is quite good chiu know ?
 the problem with an authoritarian regime like cheena .
 they brainwash the children to snitch on the parents .
 if the parent looks at the official with eyes of disdain or disapproval .
 the child will report the parents to the state .
 imagine living in a society where everyone chiu know ,  from your child ,  the child chiu bring to this world .
 to your neighbors ,  friends ,  and family .
 everyone has a social credit score ,  that even your loved ones will snitch on chiu .
 in such a society ,  chiu either kill yourself or spread the ccp &apos;s poison .
 that is why the ccp is so strong .
 they do these is east germany and russia ?
 this is ultimate form of sinkie pawn sinkie .
 many things i bought from shopee cheena was crap .
 example the usb fan actually destroyed 2 of my pc usb port causing it to burn out ,  before the fan died on the 2nd day .
 so called xiaomi laptop backpack strap fasterner broke both sides after less than 2mths usage ,  the plastic edges was razor sharp ,  cut my arms badly .
 many stuff from cheena is crap
 lol we talking about mainland cheena ,  not the our local cheena chinese ,  they oredi escaped cheena .
 ibs come in defend liao bo ?
 i remember tiongs selling fruit juice mixed with rotten fruits in shopping center and some customers are kids .
 really cek ark
  &apos;they brainwash the children to snitch on the parents .
  &apos; -> where did chiu get this info from ?
 i &apos;ve not heard about this or witnessed this in cheena .
 but indeed ,  the ccp has total control over their people .
 i dont think most of them agree with the bans and restrictions but they dont feel like they have the time or money to protest against it .
 if they agree with the bans and restrictions ,  it &apos;s cos media brainwashed them to think that ccp is doing what &apos;s good for them .
 at least thats what they told me -  &apos;i watched the video/documentary on tv/weibo/tudou/youku/bilibili explaining why the bans are good for us &apos; .
 even when chiu reside in cheena and turn on their tv ,  it is full of  &apos;ccp is the best &apos; propaganda .
 things will oni change when the ccp regime is overthrowned .
 whoever does it will be my hero since i detest them for personal reasons .
 they using slave labor ,  prisoners and child labor to create those products .
 chiu think sweat shops in cheena have quality check ?
 any gods to help ?
 or is it ownself help ownself now ?
 gods oso need to be quarantineed hor
 could be god that started it
 if gods started it ,  it &apos;ll wipe out 20 to 30% of those infected so as to reduce stress on planet earth like black death or spanish flu
 as usual ignorant humans blaming others for their own folly .
 many sages come and go teaching humans to be benevolent and kind and compassionate to all lives .
 even animals are more loving compare to some humans .
 covid is god &apos;s will to cull human population .
 dont think much about god .
 what im going to say might made many believers to disagree or hate me ,  there is definitely no such entity .
 even if there &apos;s actually such entity ,  why cant chiu think maybe ,  that oni and mighty entity created the virus to control and reduce the entire population living on this planet we called earth .
 god started this pandemic to heal mother earth .
 yealor no major world war at the moment ,  need some mechanism to reduce the human population .
 moderators may not be happy but have to tell the truth ,  all these covid viruses have souls ,  they came for revenge ,  all from slaughtered animals ,  poultry ,  fishes ,  etc .
 heaven allowed them to take their revenge ,  have to be fair ,  they have the right to revenge .
 oni your own karma can help chiu during this difficult time .
 god is dead and we killed him
 oredi so many pastors and spiritual teachers died of covid ,  really tell chiu something .
 oh and the one still alive tend to be among the first to take the vaccines ,  so afraid of death .
 god work in mysterious ways
 so where are the gods ?
 who can help the pandemic victim in this situation ?
 all the edmw religious folks run away liao .
 dat times the pandemics first started hor ,  i was spendings alot time in cheena and then see the u .
 press smear them everyday sibei dulan ,  so i pray to god to plotect cheena .
 then after that ,  the lightning struck the flag of u .
 and oso kena two soldier stand beside sia .
 today ,  cheena economy number 1 recovery ,  and least cases .
 then i oso pray for singapore .
 we top in covid handlings siol .
 the rest stills kena ,  is god has a plan la .
 well u see the devil .

 ccp want to nuke america better make sure all the yanks are toast ,  the 2nd strike confirm 1 .
 4 billion vaporized
 nuclear war will be devastating to the entire population on earth .
 350 is alot to clean up us .
 ccp can trade 10 , 000 chinese life for 1 angmok ,   thats system advantage for chiu .
 thing is nobody actually test .
 firing a hypersonic missile at a target .
 then test all available counter measures to intercept it .
 as that would be revealing all your cards even before a fight .
 but i think if either cheena or us want to pre-emptively attack another side with nukes .
 first thing to do is take down all known targeting satellite .
 sha zhukang makes a good point: .
 cheena should maintain its “no first use” pledge for most nuclear and non-nuclear states ,  sha said .
 but the unconditional policy “may not apply to the us unless cheena and the us negotiate a mutual understanding on no first use of nuclear weapons ,  or unless the us ceases to take any negative measures that undermine the effectiveness of china’s strategic forces” .
 cheena has no need to tie its own hands when the us refuses to adopt any  &apos;no first use &apos; policy .
 oni an incompetent gahment will unilaterally limit its defence options .
 they just want the common people to imagine cheena nuke a us city and us cowers in fear .
 and kowtow to the great middle kingdom !
 this is let them feel song and pcc one .
 of course would not let them know the retaliation coming from us nuke silos .
 gonna flatten all major population centres in cheena .
 100 into europe for the past humiliation during qing dynasty .
 150 into usa cos they angmo .
 50 into australia cos they too guailan .
 50 into india  cos extra no where to hoot .
 then wait for the nuclear winter ,  everything on earth will die .
 all threats are empty .
 mouth talk lp song .
 isnt that policy for a all nations with nuclear weapons capability .
 plan can hunt down the 8 ohio ssbn on patrol meh
 want to hoot aim the land liao .
 the 8 ohio ssbn can wipe out tiongkok in a 2nd strike leh
 shoot and see lor .
 lmao all these wumao jokers dont even know who scmp is owned by .
 scmp is owned by the tiongs hor ,  by the way it is not just any tiong ,  it is from jack mah who is an official ccp member .
 alibaba is the tiong company that owns scmp .
 alibaba is operating in cheena itself .
 ccp allow alibaba and scmp to run cos some factions of the ccp cadre endorse it so these low level wu mao peasant trolls who will never even be offered ccp membership cos of their low status and have to earn a living posting nonsense online can continue bootlicking but nothing will come out of it .
 those real ccp members will never see these clowns as their equals .
 these wumaos are nothing more than tools for them .
 it is even worst if these wumao are not even tiongs lmao !
 cheena will never ever give them citizenship no matter how hard they try ,  in fact dunnid to talk about citizenship ,  these clowns cant even smell the pr as they are definitely not exceptional people that prc wants .
 then tiong must have faith with their air defense .
 thats not counting the icbms from the first strike leh
 cai na wont go war de la !
 too humji alreadi .
 ccp is expert on nuclear war leh
 cheena should consider firing nukes first .
 totally different from  .
 cheena considers firing nukes first
 this bucket hat bozo eat too much hawker food till his brain turned numb .
 always acting like a messiah for hawkers .
 stop order food delivery ,  just go buy in person if those so call wanna support hawker .
 seetoh is just blindly defending .
 hello we are in a pandemic now ,  .
 why during normal times he never say: .
 “ridiculous for hawkers  to earn 15% profit ,  poor consumers !
 hawkers oso need to earn profits or else why open a stall sell foods ?
 if chiu doing a business claim is passion i feel is bs .
 means chiu just open for fun well perhaps for those have extra money to burn ,  if business good is a bonus .
 like recently that guy who win toto open roast meat stall .
 media report about his story .
 next day long q line up in front of his stall .
 when been interview people claim want to get his luck by eating his foods .
 chiu see how amazing now a days people is lol  .
 really shake head .
  &apos;hawker profits margins ,  hover around 12 to 15 per cent &apos; .
 what a joke is this ?
 most are marked up what  ,  unless got promotion .
 its understood by customers and the seller and platform .
 so the hawkers still have watever margin they had
 usually the delivery commission will be passed on to consumer .
 just that some consumer kiam until like to hiam online price more ex than actual price yet lazy to ownself go dabao .
 ya lor ,  i understand this seetoh trying to help hawkers ,  but how many hawker 12 to 15 percent margin  ?
 i know alot of hawkers drive big car ,  live big house
 instead of kpkb ,  why dont kf seetoh start his own more fairer online food delivery order system to take on grab and foodpanda .
 one hand rising rental during the good times .
 the other hand having heightening alerts .
 all this is just somebody doing .
 they can solve his problem ,  just when and whether they want to or not .
 12-15% oredi closed down long ago liao ,  dunno what he smoking
 he create a better image if he  .
 “fight” for hawkers  instead of taking action himself .
 cos the delivery prices are jacked up liao .
 seetoh should take a look at the prices on grab vs the ones at the stalls .
 did the hawkers complain they live in landed properties ?
 haha i can say the same thing for rental .
 how can the hawkers pay so much rent .
 so why not he reduce his rent by 50% ?
 talk cock sing song
 haha i wonder what is seetoh smoking .
 food industry profit margin is very slim nia with alot of overheads .
 for small businesses the 30% commission charges by delivery platform is considered as advertising fee oni ,  which usually eats up the remaining margin .
 profit margin is surely more more than that !
 the tzechar near my place markup between 20 to 50% for orders from its grabfood listing versus its on site prices .
 example: hor fun $4 on site ,  $6 on grabfood .
 they have long queues for onsite orders during this p2ha so delivery orders are a buffer for previous dine-in business .
 if merchant still cannot earn after all markups then should just shut down business or dont do delivery .
 seetoh is asking a valid question but i think he is asking wrongly .
 pandemic really hit everyone .
  in any difficult situation .
 evryone should help .
 where $$$ is involved ,  everyone should share some losses .
 like tank tgt la chiu know ?
 hawker rental waiver liao .
 we say dabao to support our poor hawkers ,  which come from our own wallet .
 but food delivery app still put same commission  ?
 same platform fee ?
 i think the oni business that huat and never help society to tank the losses is the food delivery .
 they just ownself huat ownself .
 in the app still can put  &apos;support our hawkers &apos; .
 is like those army people do eye power .
 tts why the resturant union write open letter to ask them to discount their platform fee/cut .
 janet hellen act like dunno .
 no condemn no threatened sanctions .
 this is western freedom and democracy ?
 all is good ,  f yeah !
 like the us ,  the saudi will claim it &apos;s not a prison but a terrorist base .
 more chances for these war merchants to sell their wares .
 hello in the news oredi as of now .
 phase 2 got what use  ?
 reduce outside gathering from 8 to 5 ?
 gahment still haven learn lesson from last year .
 still trying tighten here tighten there until suddenly cb come .
 swab now dont have doesnt mean dont have virus .

 this year again not sinkie fault .
 end up we need to sweep shiat
 cannot roll back one .
 lets create new name .
 abandon circuit breaker .
 every man for himself
 in china &apos;s kindergarten ,  they have  &apos;leadership programs &apos; .
  they start their brainwashing at kindergarten .
 part of the brainwash program is to report what chiu see is wrong to the authority (party) .
 i heard this from a chinese defector who was in the ccp youth leadership program .
 imagine your children reporting on chiu .
 they even have a code name for such brainwashed children ,  they are called the little pink of cheena .
 they are not even paid to snitch ,  they snitch on their own accord !
 chiu got to give it to the ccp ,  their propagandist is epic .
 brainwash 1 billion people to do these kind of things .
  &apos;report what chiu see is wrong to the authority &apos; oh this .
 i thought it was oni for adults .
 well ,  it &apos;s believable since they oredi treat the uyghurs as slaves anyway .
 as long as they can get their way ,  they &apos;ll do anything .
 to them ,  thats how they got as far as now as they brand themselves as the world &apos;s current leading superpower .
 but there &apos;ll still be some edmwers who suppork ccp and agree with their values anyway .
 “i feel ashamed to be chinese cos of china” why are chiu ashamed to be chinese ?
 im chinese  ,  i’m not shameful leh .
 if chiu been in tour group .
 there will be people who give chiu blackface ,  chiu can feel a certain repressed animosity .
 the magic words are  &apos;i am sinkie .
  &apos; if they know where singapore is ,  they will light up !
 attitude change 180 !
 the chinese image is very bad all over the globe .
 this is cos of china &apos;s mainland chinese are going around doing stupid things .
 shyt on floor la .
 steal stuff la .
 being uncouth la .
 a rot a rot of complains la .
 cheena guangzhou not bad la ,  i oso been there ,  the air very polluted oni .
 cheena is not all bad la ,  still got hope .
 it is that they are stuck in the ccp culture .
 if they can remove ccp and repair cheena culture ,  100% chinese pride worldwide !
 arguing on the internet is a stupid thing so nope
 welcome to ccp &apos;s utopian capitalistic society .
 just take out ccp ,  ccp is the cancer of modern society .
 even bui kim and putin now become oni benign tumors liao
 50cent army bro ?
 how can hawker so low profit 10% ?
 1 pack chicken rice selling $4 minimum .
 just a few small piece chicken meat etc .
 dont shoot the messenger la .
 looks like easier and easier to be infantry liao
 i heard too many commanders ,  too less troopers .
 many want sign on but tio rejected .
 priority given to opposite gender
 they might as well sit on top when it moves .
 when shooting videos .
 or got people watching .
 then walk/prowl/leopard crawl .
 but when nobody looking .
 chiu know what will happen la .
 then encik will ask why the drone battery drain so fast sia .
 which call of duty is this   
 victim to chiu doesnt mean victim to god .
 hardly see those edmwers that constantly argue how good their gods are ,  all disappeared liao .
 people should wake up their idea .
 whatever religions they believe oso useless ,  humans issue had to be resolved by science and logics
 religion and its worship were what got india to this day .
 the covid surge in india now can be attributed to religious observances .
 another term for covid is noah ark mini
 part of the divine plan .
 until really see
 the virus spreads oni in countries where people do not care about each other .
 if there is any message the virus is trying to send ,  it will cause for the brotherhood of mankind to care for one another to wear masks .
 fighting this virus is a joint effort ,  whoever and which country remains after this pandemic may have earned the goodwill for mankind
 what makes u think god didnt plan this ?
 too many humans oredi ,  need to reduce the figure .
 if u are into a certain religion ,  technically everything is human ownself create taichi since 2021 years ago until 2nd coming .

 oppressive gahment produce oppressive people
 so the other day loh kean yew won the gold medal and many edmwer were happy .

 malaysia and singapore are discussing the possibility of reopening their borders soon ,  said malaysia &apos;s foreign minister saifuddin abdullah .
 datuk saifuddin was assuring lawmakers in the dewan rakyat after several of them raised the plight of malaysians who have not seen their families since borders closed due to the pandemic on march 18 ,  2020 .
  &apos;i am aware that the issue is not just about covid ,  but oso about those who have been separated from loved ones even before the start of the pandemic ,  &apos; he said during his ministerial reply on the motion of thanks on the royal address on thursday (sept 23) .
  &apos;i will try to see how we can overcome this together ,  &apos; he added .
 mr saifuddin said the matter has been brought to the attention of datuk seri hishammuddin hussein who heads the committee to manage the covid pandemic in the country .
  &apos;i was oso informed that the health minister was in a telephone conversation with his sinkie counterpart on how borders can be reopened between the two countries ,  &apos; mr saifuddin said .
  &apos;i pray and hope that the matter can be resolved as soon as possible ,  &apos; he added .
 mr saifuddin said that the reopening of borders between malaysia and singapore would pave the way for the country to open up air routes with other countries like thailand .
 he was responding to the issue raised by muar mp syed saddiq syed abdul rahman ,  who said he has received numerous pleas from malaysians ,  who have not seen their loved ones for two years .
  &apos;this has led to mental problems for some ,  including divorces between married couples who have been separated ,  &apos; mr syed saddiq said .
 tebrau mp steven choong suggested allowing malaysians who are certified as fully vaccinated to return home once a month to see their families .
 mr choong said the reciprocal green lane arrangement between the two countries was for sinkies who had subsidiary companies in malaysia and did not benefit the thousands of malaysian blue-collar workers in singapore .
 mr saifuddin said that both countries had previously concluded a periodic commuting arrangement scheme that allowed malaysian workers or permanent residents to return to the country for brief visits .
 he said the scheme has helped many malaysians return to the country for a brief stay before returning to singapore to resume work .
 every month oso got joker in bolehland gahment say this .
 i need to pump full tank .
 anyone who had good childhood friends that lost contact after they moved houses ,  changed schools etc ?
 remembering how we used to play badminton in the open air court though windy ,  or basketball until the lights turned off .
 those days still no internet or mobile phones so lost contact is common .
 moi is lao uncle liao .
 maybe some people reading this thread can reconnect with their old mates ,  and just see if they are getting on ok in life  .
 my neighbourhood was in jurong east ,  n my primary school friends who lived in the same block ,  sit the same school bus ,  are 2 brothers .
 we always play those fighter picture cards in the bus ,  comparing the higher attributes .
 (lao unkers will know what i talking about)
 i oso stayed there in the 90 &apos;s .
 those were the days !
 my memory at young was very bleak ,  seems there was this girl i played with during young but she can remember but i cannot last seen was 13 years ago
 the game is called top trump .
 i remembered when i was ard 8 years old when a group of my friends were playing catching and i accidentally tripped my friend ,  tracey to a fall which resulted in breaking her glasses .
 i wanted to pay for the repair with my piggybank of $40 but she never accepted it .
 that was during the 90s .
 i can oni remember stuff beginning from k2 or sort
 i oso going for my girl who i got naked with at 10 years old
 need more details .
 which school was everyone from ?
 moi founded back 1 long lost friend recently
 all my friends left me .
  feel very sad at times thinking back .
 now really alone and lonely .
 start from primary school ?
 i was in block 103 ,  very near to fuhua primary school .
 i did not attend school there though .
 the doctor clinic nearby is still there when i passed by a few months back .
 the gp must be an old grandpa now .
 hope he is still going strong ,  he is a nice doctor .
 that is the oni shop in that stretch that remained unchanged .
 got fb not hard to trace le .
 i able to connect with most of my sec school friend .
 i no friend one .
  sometimes i think back really feel very sad .
 ya our favourite was the fighter jet one .
 i remember the 1st king was the b52 bomber ,  2nd king was the black bird surveillance plane ,  and 3rd king is the f15 air superiority fighter  .
 other cards like tanks and cars not as exciting to play for some reason .
 those were the days 
 how did chiu manage to find ?
 bump into him on the street ?
 able to recognise ?
 actually sometimes walk on the street ,  see someone like sek sek ,  dunno whether is childhood friend
 i got curious about one old friend recently .
 googled his name and was surprised to see him kena caught in thailand with 2 prostitute during covid lockdown .
 got video of the raid some more .
 wa piang oei ,  your good childhood friend ?
 wa i do hope my good friends are ok leh 
 actually seldom sore throat n runny nose tio swab test .
 doc just give 5 day mc to rest
 as long as chiu got those symptoms ,  tio swab .
 dunno cos my relative practically daily runny nose sore throat type .
 not always ask to swab .
 i oni know fever then sure swab
 ya ,  doctors dont take medical history into covid considerations ,  auto swab everyone .
 that was the old rule .
 nowadays any urt symptoms ,  doctor will swab liao .
 the doctor told me sorry ,  no choice cos moh oredi reminded them cannot just give 5 day mc .
 so now little bit runny nose ,  cough or sore throat is swab .
 then moh/moe need to fix their processes .
 or maybe dunnid .
 the longer chiu take to inform ,  the longer people are exposed to possible infections until quarantined .
 so far ,  we have not heard any linked case to this student ,  right ?
 let &apos;s hope it stays that way .
 sorry to say this but my prediction came true .
 hope some smart people listened and went to stock up instead of queuing with all the sheep now 
 heng i buy from shopee no need to queue .
 chiu predict 4d or toto can ?
 0 got what use .
 yeah later items start disappearing from your basket cos keep out of stock .
 same thing happened last cb .
 0 is for chiu to go buy ntuc and sheng siong stock and sell cold storage/dbs la u low ses cb .
 chiu see how huat sheng siong stock is now ?
 knn everything oso 4d toto buey sian meh .
 bait chiu to show your edmw account .
 just need that leap of courage and faith  .
 not all qns have answers .
 even if chiu get an answer ,  chiu will still be hesitating .
 just reply to her igstory ask her where she bought her food from ,  from there gauge her reaction
 but she  deleted my friend &apos;s number now add back but never talk to each other .
 just block her lor .
 my friend scared she got bf or never reply him cos bad blood when broke up
 no la just feel strange why add but never talk .
 asking here if anyone have same experience
 she deleted your number to prove her loyalty to her new bf in the beginning .
 but her new bf said dont delete the number otherwise chiu will escalate and starting to stalk her .
 hence adding back your number
 scared this scared that then dont regret
 think too much ,  maybe used back the phone with his contact .
 never delete so if any message and call from him then know who .
 phone storage is big can afford to collect number .
 the smart ones will use another lumber to add x &apos;s lumber to track 
 why u so kepo and concern so much about your friend ?
 both of chiu gay ?
 jitao block and delete ,  no need think so much .
 dont think too much .
 my contact list got people i dont even talk to them for over 10 years ,  i dont del also
 chiu msg her birthday greeting or any festiveal greeting  if reply mean interested to stay in touch la ,  so easy oso need open thread to ask
 no confirm deleted then add back cos now he can see her whatsapp status and telegram again  .
 when deleted cannot see .
 is deleted then add back but never talk .
 as fire extinguisher ?
 she needs it ,  it will be there ?
 tried with another phone .

 new delhi: novavax — a us-based biotechnology company — this month announced that its vaccine has an efficacy of over 90 percent against covid infection and 100 percent efficacy in protection from severe disease against covid .
 the vaccine — known as nvx-cov2373 — is among the first to have undergone phase 3 clinical trials at a time when new covid variants of concern such as the b .
 7 (alpha) and b .
 351 (beta) were prevalent in the population .
 the modi gahment gave pune-based serum institute of india (sii) the go-ahead to manufacture and stockpile the vaccine .
 the clinical trials are underway in india and the vaccine is likely to hit the market under the name covovax by september this year .
 sii is oredi producing covishield ,  the vaccine developed by researchers at oxford university and astrazeneca in the uk .
 theprint explains how this novavax vaccine is different .
 spike protein formula .
 novavax describes its vaccine as a recombinant nanoparticle protein-based covid vaccine .
 to develop the vaccine ,  researchers selected a part of the genetic sequence of the virus that produces the spike protein .
 this sequence was then introduced in baculoviruses — pathogens that attack insects .
 these modified baculoviruses were then made to infect moth cells in the lab ,  so that the cells produce proteins that are similar in structure to the sars-cov-2 spike protein .
 these proteins are then purified and administered with an adjuvant — a solution that enhances the ability of a vaccine to work — called matrix m ,  oso produced by novavax .
 this protein in the vaccine tricks the immune system into believing that it is under attack from the sars-cov-2 .
 as a result ,  the body launches an immune response designed to fight off the virus .
 meanwhile ,  the adjuvant matrix m ,  increases the neutralising antibodies and induces long-lasting b cells ,  a type of white blood cell that enhances immunity .
 in comparison ,  covishield contains a weakened and non-replicating version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) ,  which usually infects chimpanzees and is harmless in humans .
 the adenovirus has been engineered to express the sars-cov-2 spike protein .
 novavax vaccine covovax could be available in india soon: how it works ,  differs from covishield .
 pune-based serum institute is manufacturing the vaccine apart from the astrazeneca vaccine covishield .
 covovax could be available by september this year .

 if chius is nots vaccinateds means chius is nots a team players ,  hards to works withs 
 parents brought baby out everywhere and allow others to touch ,  cuddle and carry ?
 then kena covid ?
 seen many parents too in crowded public places ,  many pushing strollers .
 tempting fate oso ?
 lack of common sense .
 they plan to approve jabs for babies early next year ,  so can expect the propaganda to ramp up
 i expect the trend here is hotter .
 many gullibles very confident to push their baby and trolley out in the malls
 i can oso say baby died from breastfeeding vaccines .
 why last time no report .
 i really saw this as in they bring baby to neighbour hood or malls n chit chat with ppl
 could be due to secondary infection .
 since it is the us ,  should sue the doctor .
 those who think covid is not fatal are dumb .
 it can kill anyone .
 lol the news oni come out when the jabs are close .
 seems like its going for young children too
 must mandate vaccination for kids
 jabbing protects your family even tho chiu still spread the virus .
 therefore let &apos;s open op the vtl .

 there was a girl who sat beside me in pri school .
 friendly and alwys tried to make fren with me .
 but i was a loner and violent .
 once i use my book spine and hit her face .
 i am very sorry .
 her name sheila or sheena or something .
 if can i oso wan to apologise to all i have hurt in the past .
 i think many at this age here will be interested in finding mostly kindergarten / primary school friends of the past .
 secondary school / poly / uni most of us probably still in connect with the close ones .
 used to have a neighbour who i hang out with most of the times during childhood times .
 his family was rich  ,  he had all the game consoles .
 i will go over his house to play games during weekends .
 i will go with him to buy games or walk around .
  sometimes when his family go out ,  they will bring me along oso .
 past few years he has moved out .
 his parents are still staying at my area .
 once in ahwile i will meet him below when he visits his parents .
 we will just say hi and chat for a few minutes before walking away .
 sometimes we will recall back our childhood n have a good laugh when we happen to meet
 not really if u are uncle like me .
  lost contact with everyone except some in jc and uni .
  mainly due to no hp then .
  secondary school oni a few .
  for secondary school ,  i managed to find them on facebook .
 wish i didnt had such good memory .
 i have a primary school friend in de la salle primary (grad 1990) .
  back then i was sorta bullied but this friend stood up for me several times .
  i lost contact with him after graduation .
   a few years back i finally found him on facebook .
  it was hard csi work (managed to find him by tracking down his wife) .
 i messaged his wife to inform him of my intentions to catch up with him .
  wife told me to go message him on facebook (he was using a fictitious name) .
  i never got a response .
  i oso did not want to bother his wife further since she appeared reluctant to help me pass message to him .
 kenneth ,  if u are reading this ,  i am interested to catch up with u .
 hope chiu are able to find her .
 but probably need to provide more info about your primary school and the batch ?
 i truly hope some are reading edmw 
 such friends really made a difference in our formative years .
 in the days where things are much simpler ,  no money to buy toys ,  and oni get from eating those cheap kaka snacks ,  always exchange the toys to play with friends who are more well to do ,  take a long bus ride to the east to cycle ,  or once in a long while having some savings to go to fastfood restaurant for a meal .
 adrian and alvin ,  i remember the good ole days ,  and hope u are doing ok .
 let &apos;s catch up if somehow u read this 
 i am oso looking for my primary school mates ,  managed to connect to some of them but still missing some .
 tried many ways but cant find them .
 most of us did not have angmo name during that time .
 that why difficult to search for them using social media as they might be using angmo name now .
 so long never met up will still remain close ?
 nowadays see him on news ,  no more coolie language .
 always using proper engrish .
 then always wear a suit and gel up his hair nice nice .
 he trying to make a attempt to sneak attack on ah heng ?
 no more xia sway tok on carrie lam .
 but he looks tired & resigned leh .

 why he never give stats on top 1% of income earners ?
 exception instead of the norm

 the 14% is their pappies like css .

 this kind everyone is super low ses parents bt if go local uni sure win in life .
 chiu count hw many ratio go local uni la then chiu count .
 the numbers look gd .
 bt scholars should do another study .
 bottom 15% born in 1990s ,  suck cock generation .
 go ite/pvt uni .
 can become top 1/5 income earners in 30s ?
 my bother is millennial ,  born in bottom 1/5 ,  now in top 1/5 .
 im at median oni .
 but yes ,  possible .
 and exception ,  not the norm .
 must have been miw
 isnt that a bad thing ?
 assuming everyone has equal chance ,  everyone should have 20% chance of becoming 1/5 top earners in their 30s .
 however ,  the poor oni got 14 .
 3% chance of becoming 1/5 top earners in their 30s .
 strike toto or crypto windfall .

 any other tips to go from bottom to top
 7% from poor families didnt make it in life
 he should admit uplifting the poor has failed
 cause your assumption wrong liao .
 everyone doesn’t have an equal chance .
 your status at birth does affect your status at 30s .
 the race is not fair from the day chiu born .
 chiu born as rich man son vs poor man son the difference is damn big .
 society has implemented means to move up ,  but it’s not easy man .
 like what the other edmwer said ,  what about the majority 86%  ?
 chiu dont hear stories about those who failed .
 history are written by the victors
 dont look at the glass half empty .

 very disappointed in him
 poker is not a good sport
 jurong sec har ?
 or jurong primary school .
 my advice is just let memories be memories .
 sometimes ignorance is bliss
 i guess as we grow older ,  we tend to contemplate how we have lived our lives and if we could have done any better .
 best not to dwell on these things so much as they will leave chiu frustrated but it &apos;s nice to reconnect with others who understand what we went through and how we managed to get through these together !
 i myself went to jurong primary school from 1988 to 1993 .
 lovely memories of the school though it no longer exists 
 personally ,  i dont really want to meet friends from too long time ago .
 their character changed alot oredi ,  like become another person .
 jurong primary school closed down ?
 was it at taman jurong ?
 my primary school not so near n i really enjoy the crazy school bus rides in the early morn and after school dismissal .
 the botak bus uncle even had to stop the bus at the side of the road every once in a few days and shout at us and threaten to throw us off the bus .
 in the rare occasions where do take the school bus home ,  or before the sports day ,  will go for adventure trip to coronation plaza see see look look .
 oso remember the comics mart at serene center .
 days of being young and dumb
 he pass away but the clinic is still in his name .
 chiu should still remember jurong east central first bookstore then .
 yes ej tan clinic .
 he passed away ?
 he saw me alot last time ,  quite a problem child i was .
 thats super sad .
 i am part of the 1st few batches in je .
 before mrt was even there .
 the 1st 7/11 and the oriental emporium .
 u remember that ?
 u must be my neighbour in one of the nearby blocks .
 used to have a close friend in sec school .
 we took the same bus home ,  so spend alot of time together .
 we took turns giving each other 20 trivia questions .
 oso spend some time trying out-of-body stuff .
 lost touch after sec school as i moved from east to west .
 bump into him 20 years later at shenton way .
 found out he joined a taiwanese sect and became a vegetarian .
 he gave me a draft of a book he was writing .
 in it ,  he did write about the times we spend together .
 he oso said i was forever looking at new things ,  that my interests keep jumping .
 and then he said that he was able to experience out-of-body experience ,  which was a shock to me .
 i never did get back to him ,  that was the last time i saw him .
 sect as in he dabbled with the occult ?
 all my school mates and friends are doing better than me ?
  some married and having children and all seems doing well at least as far as i know .
  but i dunno where are they and what are they doing now ?
 no one wants to associate with me so i am very much to myself ,  parents and possibly my other three tenants ?
 no ,  nothing sinister .
 they advocate healthy living ,  meditation ,  very mild stuff .
 interesting ,  my admin girl that time was oso from the same sect .
 strange coincidence indeed .
 but u kept to yourself since childhood/primary school days ?
 dont be too negative ,  not saying to compare with your schoolmates .
 just if anyone who managed to leave a lasting impression or forged a close friendship while it lasted and before lost contact .
 remember i have a close friend in secondary school .
 will go city hall walk walk with him .
 but not in contact anymore .
 have when fb first started can find them but new privacy setting now cannot find them liao
 hope they are in edmw ,  and hope they surfing this thread and read that chiu are reaching out to them .
 it is a long shot but at least a chance
 i think dr ej tan clinic is oso one of the original and still around .
 even the clinic at 114 that doctor oso retires and sold his clinic off .
 last time when first move into hdb flats @st .
 13 ivory heights hudc hasn &apos;t even complete yet .
 i remember one summer all the neighborhood kids flying own homemade kites at that field then .
 one of the kites  flew so high that it gets entangled on someone &apos;s window on blk 109 .
 we go up retrieve from the ahnehs house !
 the first 7-11 is quite mind-blowing then .
 i am wondering how can they 365days and 24hrs open !
 i refuse to find old friend cos i am a loser .
 those pri school after come out lost touch le
 what happened to them ?
 the glass is 14 .
 the rich will prevent the poor from moving up as it will hurt status quo
 i bet for the top 10% .
 99% of their children become to the top 10% in net worth by their 30s 50s and 100s .
 the loser 1% probably got cheated by a woman or fell into drug habits
 thats why i am saying .
 the figures show that in singapore ,  people dont have similar chance .
 it’s not really newsworthy to report someone born in bottom 20 and remain in bottom 20 mah .
 success stories get more attention cause we all wish we can be that success person .
 and what happened to them in their 40s ?
 that generation of course la .
 if chiu have degree chiu considered on a sure-win path ,  that time a level oredi considered very satki .
 if your father is someone famous ,  the u can go a long way lor .
 pad urself with branded degrees (they are not hard with the help of tutors) ,  branded experience ,  c level position (you have the guidance of your father and his c suite cronies in every industry) ,  millions some even billions to spend ,  u can do anything u want literally .
 we’re the middle children of history ,  man .
 no purpose or place .
 we have no great war .
 no great depression .
 our great war’s a spiritual war… our great depression is our lives .
 we’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires ,  and movie gods ,  and rock stars .
 and we’re slowly learning that fact .
 and we’re very ,  very pissed off .
 let &apos;s face it ,  life isnt fair ,  but for 14 .
 3% of the bottom 20% to make it to the top .
 thats very impressive oredi ,  they probably climbed up through education .
 so if you &apos;re born poor ,  better study hard .
 chiu may need to work harder than those oredi born with a silver spoon ,  but at least chiu get a chance to break out of poverty ,  unlike those in your position born in a 3rd world country .
 funny thing is ,  they have data of millennials oredi ,  since many millennials are oredi in mid 30s .
 where is the data ?
 in before data shows that millennials are earning less than their parents .
 the perfect example of rich father famous son is donald trump lor .
 trump is not the most intelligent person but due to his father he could do anything he wanted ,  president ,  real estate mogul ,  etc .
 particularly in east asia u can oso see those people grandfather rich ,  father famous ,  son rich and famous ,  etc .
 but probably with these two faced  &apos;xiao ren &apos; is they backstab everyone even family and friends and sometimes u can see publicly breakup with wife ,  friends ,  family .
 then u see sue wife ,  sue siblings ,  etc lor .
 get into business or politics is all their cronies one .
 1% strike toto or got windfall .
 but in my opinion ,  yup i agree in singapore ,  education is the best and most reliable (not luck or special talent)  method to climb up .
 cronyism: rich connected father (50m) -> rich connected son (500m-1b) -> place friends and allies in positions of power to secure own wealth and position -> trust fund/hide salary and family wealth from public view/overseas assets/have a public face who is someone caring warm and down to earth (not really that hard to act anyway)
 definitely an example .
 but at least he became richer than his dad ,  so fair enough .
 that is very selective representation of statistics leh… .
 u really believe he oni got 1m ?
 1m can buy u half of singapore oredi .
 gimme a break la .
 he got plenty more ,  he got all the contacts ,  his father helped him with everything ,  his children now all running his company openly ,  he even got them into white house ,  he wanna be president not for money but for the cronyism model (which can be legal) .
 so it is better to be borned poor .
 never really understood why sg &apos;s education dont emphasize on what &apos;s really important .
 things that are most important isnt .
 instead it should be more focused on .
 how to remember .
 how to be efficient ,  focus ,  adaptable and enterprising .
 how to be happy .
 and then expand to these stuff .
 courses about financial management .
 courses about self awareness .
 courses on healthy life and nutrition .
 courses on social skills .
 or any variants of those ,  it &apos;s just an example .
 of course fundamentals of languages ,  math and science is important ,  but after the 1st 4-5 years ,  those things are but a base to learn what &apos;s really important .

 hard to tell cos u never know what a woman is thinking lol .
 maybe unblock cos want pretend nothing happened ?
 cos u hafta care enough to block someone .
 unblock = indifferent le ?
 ask yourself how do u even know your ex added chiu to their contact list ?
 confirmed they are still in your contact list so u can stalk them right ?
 next ,  ask yourself back why u still have them in your contact list
 not me is my friend .
 use another phone to see whatsapp status cant see my friend &apos;s phone can see .
 telegram cant see her number  suddenly  then now can see .
 there are 3 settings in whatsapp who can see my online status nobody /my contact/ everybody  .
 other phone cannot see oni my friend can  .
 got a period cannot see think she deleted the number .
 telegram oso give u the message u can oni see this person &apos;s contact number if oni he/she adds u .
 now all resolved  .
 so it &apos;s deleted now readd .
 men and women different la .
 my friend got her contact cos he values the past .
 maybe she friendzone my friend
 ts dont jjww la .
 she not yet over her ex .
 chiu no chance .
 why u think so ?
 cos she waiting for that one day .
 my ex oso do that .
 when i changed no .
 he will find ways to know my new no .
 but he saved into his phone oni but never talk .
 i hope he dont have my no .
 it &apos;s creepy as if he wants to be stalker lol .
 but if u delete his number now then readd his number again what would it mean ?
 i wont even do that .
 i dont even have his no .
 i oso want to know what is he thinking and why he does that .
 i mean hypothetically if let &apos;s say u delete his number then one day he called u accidentally but he kup the phone then u re add his number into your contact but u guys never talk  .
 what does it mean from a psychological pov .
 i get it u wont want to add his number cos u hate him .
 your want is my want .
 thats what i want to know too
 ok let me analyze for u from a guys perspective .
 how does he get your new number ?
 through common friends ?
 yeah through common friends .
 i did tell my friends before not to give my no .
 away without asking me or letting me know first but still this would happen .
 ok then i guess a girl would re add so that she knows is him rather than not know who this no .
 in case he call again or text her then she would know who is that .
 but what she wanna do later like continue talk to him or block would be another thing lor .
 ok i have the answer for u that means he still hopes that u will go back to him .
 asking common friends about u is one sign he still hopes so
 s &apos;pore could &apos;ve had common currency with m &apos;sia ,  negotiations detailed in book celebrating gic &apos;s 40th anniversary .
 titled bold vision ,  the book tells the story of singapore &apos;s reserves and the founding of gic .
 why she indirectly say ica cannot do their jods properly to catch all the fake vax cases and more virus will come singapore to meet us

 bravo ,  mdm hc has spoken .
 time to disband this useless clueless panel .
 cos during those days when lao uncle in primary school .
 no internet ,  no smartphone (actually not even handphone ,  and too young for pager) .
 really is through snail mail address ,  or land telephone line ,  thats why will take effort in locating them .
 oh yes ,  added challenge in my view ,  last time primary school first mandate use of hanyu pinyin names ,  then after mandate to change to dialect names .
 thats why oso alot untraceable 
 eh i was oso flying kite high high from the playground below 103 thereabouts .
 flew high and across the mrt train tracks running above jurong town hall road .
 if chiu fly kites ,  maybe maybe we cross paths before  .
 yes the hudc dont even have a name before privatisation ,  i have a primary school friend oso staying in block 112 there ,  went into his place n it is huge .
 no eh ,  jurong primary school was around the canal (nearer to chinese garden) .
 now it seems like it &apos;s a student hostel .
 at least they retained the school architecture
 i dont even bother reaching out to not close ones .
 but maybe we all should
 yes i think really should ,  at least to the people who matters and mean something to us .
 they had a hand in shaping how we turned out ,  and walk with us in moments in the past
 i believe we all have 1 friend that know everyone can connect with everyone but as we get busy i stop contacting them .
 hmmm if near chinese garden area ,  oso close to merlimau primary ?
 i remember 2 schools side by side after the left turn
 bumping up to try keep the search alive
 not to mention oso childhood crushes .
 i was from co-ed school ,  so really puppy love .
 exchanging love letter through friend .
 remember last time call land line to girls home need to pakat with her ,  cos always get interrogated by her mom or screamed at by her dad .
 so i let the phone ring twice then hang up .
 the next call that comes in she will know it is me who calling n get to the phone before her parents   .
 talk on phone until dad shout at me that it is enough .
 remember last time got call waiting on the land line also
 i lived in lengkok bahru , jalan tiong and tiong bahru areas from 1982 to 2011 .
 studied primary and secondary schools over there .
 think most of my friends moved to areas all over the island .
 kena sabo in secondary school by a classmate and the girls avoided me like a plague for the next few years .
 used to buy copies of teens and teenage magazines just to write to the girls in penpal corners behind .
 fence up now and getting demolish for new polyclinic .
 i drive past everyday .
 the school moves from old hongkah village to there back in 1987 .
 my principal then mr .
 toh was telling us it cost about 5 or 6mil sgd then .
 now ,  it moves and combined with boonlay primary near guanteck temple nearby .
 hello ,  looking for this guy ‘kenneth tan gim chuan’ ,  used to stay pp one .
 oh yea i remember the teens and teenage magazine .
 that is first experience before the fhms ,  maxims days  .
 the pen pal column was nice ,  and if chiu remember things like: .
  &apos;to the girl in rgss uniform who takes bus 74 every morning ,  just want to tell chiu it is great to see your smile everyday .
 hope chiu oso notice me and i can get to know chiu better .
 where were chiu staying in je in those day bro ?
 u know the neighbourhood exceptionally well .
 i am a jurong east boy all my life !
 i love this place !
 which block do u reside at ?
 i love the area oso ,  slowly slowly built up until it is today .
 in our time no such thing as gateway area or jem or westgate .
 jurong entertainment center eventually ?
 the 3 storey building with ice skating rink ,  bowling and arcade .
 (next to the library) and what is the other called jurong east entertainment complex ?
 (the one that housed the shaw cinemas)
 the best thing i got from those magazines is that i knew my girlfriend  .
 turned wife from the pen pal column .
 jurong east is a nice place back in 1990s .
 used to spend a week during every school holiday at my aunt &apos;s house over there .
 explored her neighbourhood during those 1 week stays with her .
 she used to stay near the jurong jc side .
 that is a heart warming and meaningful outcome bro .
 i guess is really destiny .
 hope there are many more like chiu .
 jjc side oso used to go now n then ,  quite quiet neighbourhood and oni disturbances is the fighter jet sound .
 big houses that side .
 so far the consolidation (please correct me if wrong): .
 runforyourlife searching for kenneth tan gim chuan who used to live in pasir panjang ?
 wood looking to apologise to a sheena or sheila from his primary school days .
 keithtan1979 looking for kenneth who stood up for him ,  from de la salle primary (graduating class 1990) .
 octane 67 from jurong primary school batch of 1988 to 1993 .
  &apos;1982-1994 &apos; looking for su zibin ,  indonesian-chinese primary school classmate .
 value of educatition has been diluted .
 3% how many male and how many female ?
 females are known to easily move up social ladders overnight .
 funny so many people here think everyone born poor should move up .
 it’s not a fantasy world le ,  someone has to be at the bottom right ?
 life isn’t fair ,  some born no hands ,  some born no legs ,  some born poor ,  some born rich but got genetic problems .
 the main point is that 14% of these people born into poor families were able to move up the social ladder .
 the opportunity is there ,  but whether u got the hands ,  legs ,  brains or genes to do it is another matter .
 i thought i was the 14 .
 3% then i went back to the 85 .
 luck is very important to climb up .
 singapore education is meh .
 if u don’t have rich parents to guide u ,  handhold u ,  give u all the guidance n resources that u need ,  chances r the children will gg .
 it will then depend on luck n other factors .
 or the child will have to depend on himself n herself to find a way out .
 can’t depend on singapore education for sure ,  n if no parents to rely on for help ,  it’s really up to the child .
 one thing for sure ,  it’s getting more n more difficult to climb up the corporate ladder as more n more spots n reserved for women n fts .
 so most singapore males can oni be average wage slaves .
 the problem is ,  what do chiu call education ?
 if my dad told me ,   &apos;son ,  dont pay $30k to ntu ,  instead put it in tqqq &apos; ,  i would be retired now instead of taking art every week .
 top 1/5 earners ,  but still 2/5 networth .
 yes ,  whether u lucky to be born smart and handsome .
 if you’re born smart and handsome u can be sure it is easier for u to climb
 at the end of the day ,  smart and hard working will lead one to success .
 my classmates from special school are like me with low average iq ,  but lao peh have business ,  staying in detached homes .
 even the ones can’t afford landed can still buy naptune court with mercedes e class .
 diu moi born in 1977 
 walan ,  so fast our ministers oredi start to show us their keleng-ah siao liao .
 moi is consider under what type of % now ?
 and here is where all those mercedes ahbengs come from .
 system designed to keep most on the hamster wheel
 err chiu disagree what ?
 it sounds like chiu agreeing with me leh .
 luck is the best way cos chiu can’t beat winning 8m toto tonight .
 but luck is not the most reliable way .
 that’s why i put there bracket (not luck based)… cos chiu can’t beat dumb luck .
 u guys see the beauty of this sentence ?
 but it looks liddat right ?
 if u do the maths ,  it is 2 .
 86% of people move to top 1/5 income earners .
 it is not top 1/5 .
 it is 1/5 income earners .
 u see the hard truth ?
 jobseekers &apos; diaries: i was laid off twice in 8 months but landed a job through networking ,  humility​ .
 mr kenan ram (pictured) was retrenched twice during the covid pandemic .
 as jobs are a top concern for sinkies in the covid crisis ,  today’s voices section is publishing first-hand accounts from jobseekers in which they reflect on their experiences and what keeps them going .
 in this instalment of jobseekers’ diaries ,  business development veteran kenan ram ,  40 ,  talks about how he was retrenched twice during the covid pandemic .
 despite the double setback ,  he maintained a positive attitude ,  improved his resume and turned his attention to sectors and positions he had not previously considered before landing a new job .
 there is a saying that lightning does not strike twice .
 but i felt like the shock of lightning hit me more than once when i was retrenched twice during the covid pandemic .
 i was working as a regional development manager for an events management company for close to 10 months when the news of being laid off was delivered to me in june 2020 as the position had been made redundant .
 though i was disappointed ,  i did not let it affect me .
 i immediately started applying for jobs on the mycareersfuture platform .
 through this ,  i came to know about gahment agency workforce singapore &apos;s careers connect centre and decided to seek career help .
 read also​jobseekers’ diaries: my months-long job search has been futile so far ,  but i’ll never give up​ .
 i was connected with senior career coach noralizah ,  who gave me tips on improving my resume to better showcase my professional experience and skill sets ,  and who oso encouraged me to leverage my networks and be more active on the professional networking site linkedin during my job search .
 in october 2020 ,  i landed a full-time position with another events management company as a business development executive .
 unfortunately ,  the joy didn’t last long as i was let go in february 2021 with the company downsizing cos of the pandemic .
 the thought of having to restart the whole job search process frustrated me ,  but i remained positive as i learnt that there is no shame in falling down and oni pride in getting back up .
 every time i hit rock bottom ,  the oni way was to look up and stand tall .
 my wife has been my pillar of support during this difficult time .
 once again ,  i went back to the drawing board ,  tapping the various job portals and linkedin in my job search .
 i applied for roles that i was familiar with ,  such as in business development and sales ,  and considered industries including fast-moving consumer goods and logistics ,  which were new to me .
 read also​jobseekers’ diaries: the pandemic made my job search tougher ,  but i found my passion in f&b​ .
 i must have applied for close to 20 roles a day but received very few responses from prospective employers .
 during this four-month period that i was not employed ,  i kept myself occupied by doing freelance work ,  including coaching staff manning call centres ,  while continuing my job search .
 my patience paid off when i was headhunted by a recruiter on linkedin in may 2021 and was offered a role as a business development representative with an oil-and-gas company in june 2021 .
 even though it is a junior role ,  i now enjoy my work and have put the past behind me .
 my advice to mature jobseekers out there who are in a similar situation is to stay relevant and not be afraid of making a career switch .
 be open to accepting roles that may seem like a step down from your previous role ,  stay humble and show your willingness to learn .
 while companies are looking for talents with the right skill sets ,  soft skills such as having a positive attitude would benefit one greatly as well .
 about the writer: .
 mr kenan ram ,  40 ,  was retrenched twice during the pandemic .
 he eventually landed a job with an oil-and-gas company in june 2021 .

 messages like these are crafted by the richest capitalists so that the poor have some false hope
 there are conspiracy talks on this covid pandemic being a attack to reset world economy .
 too many eggs in 1 basket .
 seeding the world with your manufacture is safer when epidemic strikes 1 country .
 reset until nasdaq above 12k
 there is a saying in business .
 redundancy and efficiency are opposite terms .
 see now singapore so reliant on cheap foreign labor
 the pandemic proved that when everything is concentrated at one place ,  a single large scale catastrophe at that particular place ,  can bring the whole world into a standstill and panic mode .
 it oso proved another thing ,  u want quality ,  u gotta pay for it .
 they gone tiongland to set up factories cos it is cheap .
 and tiongs is cheap for a good reason ,  disregarding quality and safety .
 mabbe the factory mgmt can enforce qc within their perimeter and on their products ,  but they cant enforce qc all across the tiong country .
 ultimately something will blow up outside their perimeter and beyond their control ,  and they will pay the collateral damage for it .
 and then we got over 150k covid cases .
 there is always a price to pay .
 i think messages like these are crafted by rich capitalists trying their best to steal money from other rich people .
 they might swap chairs but poor always remains poor .
 privatized profit ,  socialized costs .
 best way to make ceos rich .
 why this one so familiar 
 the rich gets richer and the poor and middle class gets a harder life .
 this one is call reset ?
 dont think it will really reset capitalism ,  shifting the capital of capitalism from one region to another then maybe .
 the wuhan virus still allow the rich to be rich and the poor to be poor .
 just that the poor will ganna hit even harder since they are more likely to lose their livelihood due to the virus .
 expect more taxes and less liberty
 haha rich get richer leh .
 the last time capitalism got reset in cheena ,  at least 15 million died .
 and zimbabwe reset capitalism ,  now 60% of the population is food insecure .
 i just got richer thanks to this pandemic !
 add established member to the list 
 up for ruffymonkey 
 maybe , can oso add kalipok , cause i m nt sure y sometime when johnsonheng post a thread , people will keep on kalipok
 there is a story behind .
 long long ago ,  there was a zehzeh who claim to be a big eater .
 then she joined an eating competition .
 the food happened to be kalipok .
 this zehzeh makan 1 nia .
 is fall out liao~  .
 think there were some edmwers who went to see the competition .
 and this zehzeh was sexposed~ 
 kumsia for sarpork !
 i still have no idea what is a kalipok~~ .
 moi help luffy korkor upz this thread~~
 quite long ago liao .
 details very sketchy now .
 kalipok = curry puff 
 use like plus one or having other usage .
 what does appm means ?
 alamak ,  this term is oredi list in the 1st page leh .
 zehzeh never go refer .
 appm : ai piak piak mai (hokkien ,  see asgm ,  piak piak)
 is that fellow a male or female then ?
 y u never add the kalipok story to the list ?
 maybe cos it &apos;s not very commonly used ?
 i thought zehzeh is used for females ?
 now ,  i am confused .
 so ,  is mosmos a male or female ?
 why this tread notch sticky yet !
 if chiu look at the overall movements within politics ,  laurence of arabia will be next pm after hsk .
 lawrence is an advisor like hsk (calculator advisor) .
 oni xiasuay chan got the balls to call people xiasuay .
 the former 2 cover and talk about things like east coast plan .
 the latter keeps it real like bukit indomee and xiasuay .
 better than talking like some low class ahbeng ma
 fark this xiasuay chan
 cos he tio sexpose by people on lying mah now the way he tok like whole face tio jab with botox
 he must have read this book .
 he has squandered his political capital .
 he doesnt know anything other than to make motherhood statements .
 dunno dont care ,  all i see are a bunch of behkan seat warmers for the next succeeding crown prince .
 last time mti under lim hng kiang was a low profile ministry ,  which in actual fact does alot of work .
 now under ccs it gets mentioned in the news alot .
 hopefully he didnt eat alot of cotton n tio stuffed up
 he talk infront of camera and behind camera is diff .
 maybe finally lowered his ego and go seek help from toastmasters trainers and profesisonal pr team
 cant stand this over-exposed guy ,  turns off every he opens his mouth
 stop attacking cute cute chan .
 at least he dares to attack oppies  .
 heng heng cannot handle oppies and ask for half time for his kar kia to write a last minute script to counter oppies .
 still chan mali chan .
 like singtel and dbs
 buy high ,  sell low .
 many such cases !
 the boss finally decide to cut loss instead of being bitten by snake all the way .
 dbs double down go all in
 mai tu liao income opportunity .
 temasek & gic what are u waiting for
 clearly tony has better acumen than ho chin ?
 now like all countries and companies want to exit india ,  nobody dare own assets there .
 sinkiland very brave and contrarian; hallmarks of a great investor
 all done not with their own money but at taxpayers and citizens expense .
 admiral cheng ho clearly has a cheaper bedder fluster strategee .
 buy high sell low and pay even higher (in fines) .
 dbs singtel have tasted it so can chiu !
 except the likes of air asia (clearly they dont get it)
 hope that hochng will pump in billions buy the stake .
 can become close partner with tata .
 paging orion from tata
 even boleh indian ceo dont believe on ceca land .
 meanwhile in sg
 india love this .
 foreigners until buay tahan ,  indian buy cheap then huat .
 why aa pulling out ?
 fortune favors the brave - janson borne
 time for temasek ,  dbs and sia to step in
 while sia is still partnering with tata .
 tiagong management fees not cheap ,  can huat alot from fees;  .
 then please advise what in your view is the best and most reliable way which is not luck or talent based .
 education will earn u a living .
 it will not make u rich .
 societies become rich first before they become commonly educated .
 people seems to buy into this myth of the government &apos;s .
 u look at taiwan ,  singapore ,  hong kong ,  cheena .
 which one became widely educated before they became rich ?
 it is the other way round .
 they are educated folks .
 not those ahbengs with little education .
 ahbengs doesn’t mean their stupid .
 got ahbengs who committed crime ,  come out good behaviour and became a lawyer .
 ok so what is the best way in your view that is not luck or talent based ?
 and please don’t say onlyfans that one is cheat code
 if the 86% oso become top quintile then what happens to the top quintile people ?
 they from rich become poor ?
 in the past ,  it used to be hard work and learn as much as u can .
 u have a chance .
 but if u look at how money is flowing around and how much assets appreciate ,  the poor have no chance .
 like i mentioned in my earlier post , u oni have a 2 .
 68% chance to become a top 1/5 income earner .
 and this is based on which years &apos; data ?
 if we cut this down to 1/6 or 1/7 top income earner ,  i am very sure it is going to look super demoralising .
 and as mentioned earlier again ,  it is not even talking about top 1/5 .
 it is talking about top 1/5 of income earner .
 sadly now ,  most of the time ,  it is down to lotsa luck .
 move on to top 1/5 earner no use la ,  the top 1/5th oredi become several times richer through asset inflation ,  total networth is what matters but its not captured in this study .
 i beg to differ .
 i don’t think being poor is necessary a disadvantage .
 but being stupid is .
 being smart means that one will know how to network ,  understand how to make passive income or start a business .
 with all of the money in the world .
  dumb folks will lose their money .
 its clearly misleading reporting
 the safe route of finding a job n being a wage slave wont get u anywhere .
 like amother edmwer mentioned ,  wage slaves r just hamsters .
 n have to continue working n working until old just to make the rich even richer .
 if u wanna break out of this ,  u need both luck n guts ,  probably some hard work n education too (by education i dont mean those stuff we learn in singapore pri sec jc) ,  i mean mindset shifts ,  knowing your own strengths n building on it .
 but cos most sinkies have been brainwashed by singapore education ,  as well as their pg n mg parents to study hard n find job n work hard ,  plus sinkies being kiasu n kia see ,  most of them end up in the conventional route of studying hard ,  find job n work hard .
 afterall this is the safest route .
 not many will dare to dream big n be different .
 most people oni dare to dream .
 some dare to work on their dreams (have guts) ,  but they realise they need luck too ,  n not many have the luck ,  have luck oso not enough ,  must have luck at the correct timing too .
 and singapore being the competitive n expensive city she is ,  it oso does not allow much room for failure .
 oni the rich can afford to venture out n afford to fail n climb back up again .
 sad to say ,  most average or below average sinkies from poor family background does not have this privilege to try ,  fail n climb back up again ,  one failure n thats it ,  they have to restart all over .
 hence they rather stick to the safe n conventional route of being the hamster ,  the wage slave .
 and that is why the rich becomes richer ,  poor remains poor or worse become poorer .
 most of the time ,  the rich will be able to get the best deals .
 be it when it comes to banks ,  cards or services .
 or even schools and housing .
 inherently ,  being poor is oredi a disadvantage .
 how often do u see a cow not eaten by a tiger ?
 it is not the cows fault to be borned as a cow .
 but he gets eaten by the tiger cos he is borned as a cow .
 one or two cows may grow so big that they cant be eaten .
 but those are the rarities .
 isnt this the same in this context ?
 not being argumentative .
 just being pragmatic .
 so they are calling it a success for saving 14 percent of the pop and ignoring the 86 percent .
 not even 41% and he fweels proud of his achievement ?
 is he overthinking .
 suggest to redistribute his salaree
 what u say is absolutely true ,  but i have a few differing views .
 it is easier said than done ,  with odds stacked up against the poor .
 how many poor people have the network with the right people ?
 how many poor people have parents or friends who teach them how to make passive income n start businesses ?
 more like they will get scammed by those fake gurus .
 rich people ,  especially those of the younger generation born to rich parents can afford to be dumb .
 they have tons of capital to burn .
 and besides how dumb can they be if their parents are capable enough to become rich in the first place .
 their parents are oso not dumb ,  they will not just sit n watch their children burn all their wealth away .
 the poor people with oni ite certs ,  failed to get to poly ,  and cannot afford private uni ,  will end up going to work straightaway ,  usually in low end jobs (f&b ,  retail ,  food delivery) .
 most students see ite as a stepping stone to poly ,  but imagine doing 2 - 4 yrs of ite ,  oni to be unable to get to poly ,  cos poly intakes prioritize o lvls students first .
 def more poly places need to be set aside for higher nitec graduates .
 or better yet ,  scrap e idea of ites and certs ,  and make polys be the new ites .
 hence ,  diploma will be the lowest ,  or bare minimum qualification in singapore ,  since ite certs are usually not enuf for most jobs .
 with all due respect to ite-ites ,  who went through e ite nitec > higher nitec > poly diploma > uni degree long route though !
 actually ,  nitec is not difficult to score .
 unless you’re talking about courses like culinary ,  then the marking scheme is different .
 put in effort confirm can do well .
 i stayed in rental accommodation and was sleeping in the hall together with my brother for a period of time .
 at one point ,  both me and my brother were not able to stay with our parents .
 in  the meantime ,  my wife was sharing one salted egg with her grandmother .
 fast forward 38 years - we are now in the top 10 percentile for hh income .
 what made a difference ?
 good education and solid jobs from graduation till now .
 in truly equal society where parent &apos;s wealth does not play a role in child success ,  that value would have been 20% .
 assuming the bottom quintile distribute 14% to each of the other quintiles ,  it will be 4x14 .
 8% of kids boned in the poor group are stuck there .
 honestly ,  that is not a very goot lumber .
 imagine chiu go to a kid borned poor ,  and chiu tell him before he do anything there is 50% odds stacked against him to make him as poor as his parents .
 i used to stay in jurong east ,  behind polyclinic  the masionatte hdb   so simple back then ,  no gem no westgate .
 biggest shopping area is entertainment center and imm 
 still remember my friend bang shattered jurong entertainment center &apos;s glass door  i hate 21st century ,  give me back the 80s to 90s 
 i understand that i actually have a number of childhood friends here .
 same school ,  same batch  .
 and amongst us ,  we all know the usernames that belong in this group .
 but apparently none of us dare to tell each other even in pm who we are in real life ,  cos no one wants to admit they are an edmwer 
 so many old folks here .
 20 years later ,  we will have people asking to bring back 2010s
 wa how did that happen ?
 got in trouble after that ?
 my parents still live blk 113 .
 by the main road .
  but i still have to go back there daily .
 actually still live very nearby oni .
 last time go science ctr and omni theater just cross the road .
 i remember one year there have a science carnival there and bring a huge monster sedated croc there for people to see and take photo .
 then jurong library .
 these places are my childhood weekend .
 cos there got aircon .
 somehow je central there now i feel like a bit neither here nor there .
 sometimes crowded and busting .
 but go there oso dunno what to buy or what to eat !
 i suspect one of them name ben jie is here .
 he jurong primary pioneer .
 i have 1 childhood friend whom  i have not contacted in over 10 years .
 but i can choose to contact him whenever i want to .
 cos  i still remember his house fone number and his angmor chu house .
 angmor chu houses are easier to remember their location than compared to hdb flat home
 lao funker spotted .
 haha ya omni theatre and science center is walking distance for both of us .
 used to catch the night 8pm show at omni theatre ,  got one called  &apos;ring of fire &apos; or a roller coaster one ,  made me super nauseous ,  almost threw up in the middle of the show .
 when first opened last time library 2 storeys .
 used paper library card and still need to chop on book  .
 we didnt have mcd until the malls opened ,  was the bk in the central .
 i like it there big ,  spacious and not crowded .
 oso gone and converted into foodcourt now 
 laoyeh and cccustom are oredi acquainted and previously from the same school ?
 this became a jurong east old friends thread !
 jurong east was great back then .
 not so crowded but oso unfortunately not much to see or do .
 had to go to jurong west/ boon lay or clementi for a more happening shopping experience or even to access a public swimming pool .
 je oso i guess good cos chiu never hear about any haunted houses or ghost stories in this estate !
 actually inefficient as it may sound ,  the new generation lost this ability to have proper penmanship ,  follow through with putting a stamp on an envelope and sending a letter out ,  then pining for a letter to be answered and sent back .
 everything happens instantaneously on email and instant messaging now ,  it is cold and robotic ,  that is totally no human touch ,  not much meaning or feel .
 some friendships are meant to die a natural death .
 social media is akin to artificial ventilation .
 and some friendships have not run the course of time .
 just need a defibrillator to jump start the system and get a pulse 
 come come welcome to share childhood friends/schools in other neighbourhoods as well .
 walk walk walk never see ,  then dunno how bang it .
 very long ago liao ,  school time era .
 ya , i felt so sad after the one week stay with my aunt was up and had to return to bukit merah to my parent &apos;s house .
 je is a side worth living and exploring haha .
 i liked to visit chinese gardens side as it was near to my aunt &apos;s house esp during the mooncake festival as they used to have carnivals for a weekend every year and chiu can see all the kids like me walking around with traditional lanterns .
 chiu can see some game stalls as well .
 my female older cousins will bring me there as well .
 but i was told to avoid some parts of je at night by my aunt as those places were not very clean .
 waa nice stories .
 miss the good old days
 boomers need to die first though .
 usa is undergoing a reset now
 our education system is good .
 our people are smart .
 just that many cannot organise thoughts into proper words of expression and have poor speaking confidence .
 will tio points bo ?
 i oso want to share some collection .
 cos its xmas i want to share my joys with edmwers too
 actually her features look quite man wor
 power white triangle
 something off about her face ,  cant pinpoint what it is
 what is the model of that camera ?
 actually i saw many times such zaogeng outside .
 when they wear dress and squat down to play with dogs or babies .
 sure zaogeng one .
 joy to the world !
 who it &apos;s she ah .
 some zao geng can be switch off .
 cnn liddat oso song ?
 would palm full tent .
 i think most encounter the morning packed cabins of mrt .
 one day ,  i usually like to go the the first cabin bec less people as air con not strong .
 as usual ,  stand near door bec cannot move further in .
 then got this syt wearing tight cut off jeans almost showing butt and low spaghetti straps .
 funny thing is she kept inchin back directly onto me ,  so close that her butt almost kena didi .
 i thought to myself ,  jipai siow liao ,  i cannot move back else kena poke by uncle ,  sides oso not option .
 in the end she move until the the pole hit the abyss .
 i was stunned ,  then lucky got someone move out i faster change place as im scared she will accuse of molest .
 sometimes really boh pian .
 what will u do in this position ?
 thinking back maybe is moi look damn good in my office wear that she tak boleh tahan .
 tap on her shoulder and say  &apos;miss ,  tah move back ,  bo wee liao la &apos;
 if u in front of me i confirm stand my ground 
 as long as your two hands are holding on your phone ,  you &apos;re safe .
 thank chiu for the csb .
 is there a mirror in your house  ?
  when we hit 10m ,  .
 chiu will not be mistaken as a molester in mrt or bus .
  chiu will be accused .
 on the escalator ,  chiu will be accused as a voyeurer .
 passing the toilet ,  chiu will be accused as a peeping tom .
 with a strong wind and rain ,  chiu will be accused as a flasher .
 when chiu smile ,  chiu will be accused of harrasement .
 sometimes i put my hand inside pocket cos very packed ,  some zeh zeh or aunties still bua their pigu on my pocket .
 that why is better to get a car .
 quite common and i never back off .
 and strange thing those girls stick on even when there were empty spaces oredi .
 i guess it is is win win .
 in before someone says buy car save reputation .
 liddat still not too bad  .
 it &apos;s when brake/accelerate that shaking
 or put both hands up and place it at the smrt network map display since chiu are close to the door .
 that way if anything happens ,  it’s the person’s fault for coming to chiu since your hands are pretty much tied so to speak .
 will faster turn around and french kiss a bangla worker .
 then declare loudly i am lgbt
 the girl can still say she felt something like a banana poking her and all hell will break loose
 i will just lanlan stand there and lun while moi modesty gets outraged  .
 if chiu lift your phone up in front of chiu and pretending chiu are reading something ,  most likely she will hit your phone first and oso give chiu the chance to oi her first .
 unless the banana is longer than the distance of the phone ,  then power to chiu man 
 the correct thing to do is to slowly keep bua chiur kukujiao against her pigu and slowly inch chiur hands insai her jeans .
 from huat i orwaes see ,  the girl will let out a soft moan and slowly reciprocate by slowly unzipping chiur pants and sug chiur kukujiao 
 how about infected hawkers their mouth ,  nose droplets/vapors fall onto foods ,  plastic packagings ,  containers ,  plastic bags ,  throwaway chopsticks/spoons ,  etc ?
 pass to customer oso easily kena .
 anything dirty can now be a suspect .
 no shat sherlock .
 until now i see ,  clementi mrt toilet still no cluster
 experts who could never see things coming ,  but able to talk cock sing song on hindsight .
 we oredi resuming dine in .
 kong simi  &apos;could &apos; ?
 must have evidence then tok hok ?
 this could be possible .
 physical cash is one of the most dirtiest objects .
 we got so many people per sqaure km
 then they can close toilet and save $$$ .
 anything oso can be used to push their agenda .
 they just implemented tray returning
 are we supposed to be surprised with this findling  ?
 the infected in bukit merah view hawker centre are mainly vendors .
 unlikely one super spreader customer infect all the vendors .
 i pui the experts again .
 clementi mrt toliet where satayxp love to hang will be a hot spot ?
 but they encourage us to go support the local hawkers  .
 who to blame for the long queues ?
 the vendors were probably infected at the toilets ?
 and some customers kena cos of lousy masks and position of the fans ,  maybe ?
 anyway ,  queuing for 30mins is really asking for it
 if this oso can qualify as finding then i dunno why jobs so hard to find in shitpore .
 seems like nowadays any retard can be in civil service ,  churning out rubbish reports
 visit these hawker centres during off peak hours to learn how the spread going on for vendors and their assistants and vendor to vendor mix
 imagine from the tray xd
 established members like us dont fraternise with crones huan .
 should not use the nonsensical edmwish in a thread that tries to make sense of it~  .
 the thing is ,  regardless of whether some1 is a guy/gal/transformer .
 most of the time in edmw ,  people just like to address each other as  &apos;zehzeh &apos;  .
 or sometimes ,  if the gender is known ,  they will purposely address them in the opposite sex .
 hence ,  a guy becomes  &apos;zehzeh &apos; or  &apos;meimei &apos; if he &apos;s younger .
 and a gal becomes a  &apos;korkor &apos; or  &apos;didi &apos; .
 as it is a well-known fact that 99 .
 u can safely assume that a person is a dude even if some1 calls him  &apos;zehzeh &apos; .
 of cos ,  there are the few active gals member here .
 but most gals chose to be mistaken as  &apos;korkor &apos; or remain low-profile .
 reason being ,  there are tons of horny young males here .
 just waiting to swam at any cheesepies that they come across .
 xiao juan now become very haolian liao~  .
 why is winnie the pooh known as juanie ?
 cos juanie always use pooh as avatar picture ?
 some of the official thread died ,  here to keep this 1 alive .
 but dont worry .
 me is will keep this thread alive even if it means getting me banned~  .
 this thread should be made stickied .
 since this thread is bumped up ,  i &apos;ll take the opportunity to ask ,  huat is potong jalan harh ?
 try saying that to atb .
 xiao juan always cum in oni to spam smellys + pcw nia~  .
 thanks alot for the explanation !
 thanks alot for info reeally helps 
 agree tt nitec is easy to score .
 however ,  a minimum of 3 .
 5 gpa is required ,  for nitec to poly straight .
 heard of peeps who failed to get to poly ,  even with high nitec gpa .
 hence ,  many nitec students progress to do 2 more yrs in higher nitec .
 for higher nitec ,  2 .
 0 gpa is e minimum to go to poly .
 sadly ,  there are hnitec grads who fail to get to poly via results based exercises like jpae .
 it wd be better for hnitec students apply for poly via eae ,  put tgt a gd portfolio ,  and score a gd enuf higher nitec gpa ,  as i see more hnitec peeps successfully got into poly via eae ,  instead of jpae .
 how many % born to top 10% later went on to be top 10% ?
 oso means 85% born to poor family is gg
 if chiu want to go popular courses ,  then sad to say ,  they have the lowest priority .
 but u most likely belong to exception rather than norm .
 i believe its more than just good education n solid jobs ba .
 now how to get solid jobs ?
 what industry are u in ?
 the job landscape have changed quite a number of times in the past 20 years .
 being in the right industry at the right time is oso important ,  n this boils down to luck .
 i dont believe good education n sheer hard work can get a person far ,  especially in today &apos;s context .
  it allows the person to survive ,  but to excel n succeed ?
 86% still forms supermajority  .
 even more than ruling supermajority sitting members in pariahment .
 even malaysians smarter than singapore  .
 can’t wait for our sia to start having plane crashes cos of our ceca pilots
 sia underwear wet .
 can’t wait to throw money away
 not sure if it &apos;s 50 or 500bps ,  but they should be fired longer ago when they failed to deliver .
 u are peasant please ,  cannot go against your overlords
 in the end tata owns everything
 temasick and sia cant wait to snap up their stake and sink sinkies future further into the black hole
 he should be familair with snakes
 ceca pilots often arrive drunk to drive planes ,  knn sibei scary to have them as pilots .
 worst place to insert n invest
 lure kumg0ng in ,  tekan until buay tahan then lup all the investment for cheap .
 standard ceca snake strategy ,  oni sinkingpore wholeheartedly buy in
 even airasia knows that it can beat covid but not snakes .
 fortune favours the bold .
 temasick huat big big liao
 they are a toxic people .
 remember that ceca lady driver reversed into a taxi outside a school ,  came out and argued so convincingly that the cab driver was the one who drove into her car ,  lucky got car cam .
 had a ceca client do the same thing to us ,  argued so convincingly that we were wrong but we had records of everything - in the end third party proved we were right ,  guess what not a single word of apology .
 then the wife came to us several months later for some work ,  i recognised the address and told her we cant help her - it &apos;s too complicated for us haha the look on her face .
 chiu oredi said they are very convincing .
 should fire the farking mas for not doing its job to govern these trustees .
 even a my indian entrepreneur cant do well in india .
 this is the sad end for many who  &apos;invest &apos; in india .
 a worthless country that has no honour .
 full of cheats .
 so now tata owns vistara ,  air india and airasia india and plans to combine all of them into one .
 read in another article they are jio-ing sia to integrate with them .
 will tio jiak or not ?
 so good of sia to help partner grow to become their greatest competitor .

 cheap and honest
 sho ownself leeturn tray is high risk
 die die dont want to admit airborne .
 yes ,  it is airborne but we need to use common sense .
 if so ,  all food centre should have infected vendors as well .
 maybe moh lick the toilet bowl and found traces of covid .
 from vifap ,  i have learnt absence of evidences means no evidences .
 moh should not post this type of news cos there is no evidences .
 cannot be bm vendors do special things
 if dont open leg wide wide ,  still will spread via long queues and toilet meh .
 stop telling people excuses and identify the root cause lah
 due to long queue at popular stalls .
 those staying around would have eat ,  smell n see until sian ,  do u think they would still queue ?
  how many infected n staying around that area patronized n queued at the  &apos;popular stall &apos; for 30mins ?
 go visit hawker centres during off peak and your eyes will be opened .
 vendors queue while customers cook ?
 this doesn’t explain why other hawker centers don’t have clusters
 partly boils down to personal hygiene
 and yet they are very confident in saying all those who died of heart attacks after taking vaccine ,  did not pass away cos of it .
 no test no case .
 thanks to no mass randomised community testing and religious tys obsession with contact tracing and clustering ,  the entire pap surveillance regime is highly dependent on index case(s) coming forward to report sick and get tested .
 oni then can their trace and test begin for any specific cluster
 lol ,  i suggested to put safe entry and exit scanning machines at toilets in the other thread .
 then can really see if these people were infected in the toilets ,  whether they are cleaners or customers .
 toilets oredi so cram (even worst than at eating establishments) ,  badly ventilated .
 alot of common surface areas that they touch .
 plus some people stay longer doing their business ,  remove masks ,  spit/cough here and there .
 and go around touching their faces ,  nose ,  hair ,  eyes and ears when they groom themselves ,  .
 most toilets the door all manual ,  have to touch the door handle or door itself to open and close .
 enter chiu touch ,  exit oso chiu touch .
 even after washing hands with soap but immediately chiu touch the door handle again to exit oso beats the purpose .
 after allowing 2 person dining in .
 all these problems will be gone right
 this prof mak just shoot without evidence .
 i can oso say covid airborne liao .
 hence so many cases .
 moh muz behave like moh .
 got evidence then conclude .
 in t3 ,  it was assumed food court patrons infect each other .
  no mention of food vendors or their assistant infected .
 in bukit mera view ,  mainly vendors and their assistants infected .
  not many customers infected .
 cos one infected person go there happen that his/her has the virus and after sneezing or coughing and then he/she touched and use the dollars and coins then spread .
 other hawker centre lucky no infected ones go there or perhaps the notes the infected person use did not have the virus cos the infected one did not sneeze or cough when handling the dollars .
 same theory as orchard ion .
 u can say why other shopping centre dont have cases ?
 cos luckily the infected ones never go the other shopping centres lor .
 suay suay just one infected one goes to the bukit merah hawker centre and happens he/she got virus on his/her hand when he/she took out the notes or coins .
 then the dollar notes and coins will then pass through many hands .
 person a may buy chicken rice ,  get back the infected notes/coins as change ,  then he goes another stall buy bak chor mee with the infected notes/coins .
 then the bak chor mee will then pass the notes/coins to the next customers and so on and so forth .
 has the authority examine the notes/coins and see whether covid virus preside over the surface of the notes/coins ?
 it is your appearance ts .
 if andylau in mrt .
 will people scream molest ?
 lucky i drive car no take bas ehm-art-dee

 this kind of situation is very common
 wrong forum bro .
 but up your points .

 even more sad .
 i used to do that too ,  until one time this sexy xmm came too near to me ,  end up i slapped her face .
 i swear my hands are on my phone !

 why the girl and guy never wear mask properly
 but why take pics of oni ft .
 in fact we local many r oso like thaz .

 like prelude to foursome
 amdl long limbed ,  nice hip-waistproportion ,  sharp features ,  big eyes ,  beautiful hair ,  who dont want ?
 but they age very quickly .
 is gahment gonna investigate them for not wearing mask properly in train ?
 best deport all of them .
 ahaha no need to marry them la
 why amdl wearing panties to board train ?
 no worries la .
  sure nothing happen to them .
 angmos can do no wrong
 hoot all of dem
 the logo on their tee is singapore american school .
 that could have been an ad for the train network .

 2 idiots going to be rerun of glynn .
 report to police & send them home

 everything in your paragraph is racial ,  societal and biological truth .
 this kind of ask is awaiting the next bundle of question .
 when crash & burn ?
 26 oredi married leh .
 got wife got car god landed .
 it &apos;s faster to be reborn with rich parents .
 naosadays is own yacht notch cats
 donno what business he do .
 maybe is the other side one .
 these type like red flag leh .
 better check their source of funds .
 have rich parents is the best .
 rented car isit ?
 i thought now hottest car is tesla ?
 ferrari can go fly kite
 parents probably helped him with little seed money to start his businesss ,  something small like $5 million maybe ?
 there is never need to envy or question how others achieved their materials and possessions .
 probably chiu can take inspiration and work towards your own possession .
 moi next life want to be borned as angmo or rich family 
 u want to buy oso can what .
 coe 458 are priced around 450k .
 take 300k loan for 7 years and slog lor .
 if not ,  can buy coe r8 .
 a ferrari is the last thing i have in mind if i strike it rich .
 he will crash and burn if he continues this retardation .
 as a senior i can tell chiu that there’s no way any middle class guy can accumulate so much wealth before turning 30 .
 he’s definitely got rich parents .

 have now added your information in as well 
 oredi forgot all my pri/sec school friends lor ,  always step adult when they &apos;re just a kid and angmo accent gaogao ,  some tried to befriend me ,  but like to do the stuffs that make them hate me ,  just to distance myself from them .
 always pray ,  tahan faster graduate ,  dont even bother say bye to them after graduation ,  just take my results and zao liao  .
 better to have no friends then having a bunch of fake friends
 i kena before pre covid ,  630pm fully packed train .
 packed like sardine raffles place .
 amdl ol chionged in ,  jitao stick against my front ,  nnp against me ,  i got no space to move oso .
 she just looked up and smile and looked away ,  her nnp still pressed against me with her career line shining brightly .
 amdl jiu si amdl .
 her butt would touch the book but not my pants .
 ts u got sexually assaulted .
 its a common misconception that oni females get assaulted by males .
 it can happen the other way round too ,  like here .
 please report police now
 tap should = molest
 benefits the contractors and the gahment oni .
 now more people dabao creates more waste and they get to hire less workers but make hawkers pay the same
 dont forget ,  to bring a towel
 benefit moi lor ,  now no need to clear other people leftovers during peak hour .
 in order to educate people on the need to create less waste ,  time to charge flat $1 tax per dabao container .
 i go home transfer the food liao wash the container return them .
 take back my $1 deposit
 container sold not returnable .
 they will ask chiu bring own container .
 most of the time i stack the trays and plates liao ,  i go buy kopi ,  come back the cleaner clear liao .
 benefits coffeeshop and hawker centre owners by cutting down manpower deployment ratio .
 who are their owners ?
  nea ,  kopitiam ,  kim san leng ,  kimly ,  etc .
 and they are who
 it’s a gahment conspiracy mah .
 more waste more tax…
 food prices went up cos the food operators said they need to pay for cleaners to clear tables .
 now that they dunnid to clear tables liao ,  food prices went up again .
 cleaners nw all stand one corner lepak .
 but i bet they will be out of jod soon .
 so it benefits the rich operators/owners lor .
 they waiting for people to slowly forget it .
 in the name of environment .
 next ge use electronic voting please .
 cos must raise pay of the cleaners .
 i always bring a mop too
 dont mind it  ,  means cleaner no waste time too and fro tray area  ,  can focus on cleaning tables .
 benefits pap cronies who run  &apos;social enterprises &apos;
 jeez ,  i wonder if we would have come to this stage if we have stronger restrictions on who can come into our country ,  instead of letting random family members come into our country for visitations .
 my friend wasn &apos;t even allowed to visit his hospitalized father in law in another country due to restrictions .
 yet a mother can come visit son for whatever reason .
 please close public toilet
 moh considers queueing 30 minutes as close contact .
 but squeezing in buses/mrt is ok .
 wait… covid got no ezlink card
 pofma this kenneth mak la .
 why everything  &apos;could have &apos; ?
 where is their evidence based approach ?
 show us evidence and proper conclusive findings lah
 hope garment can close public toilets .
 oni can use private home toilet or office toilet .
 could have been a place of covid transmission .
 oredi said many times ,  covid no ezlink card
 even the takeaway fork and spoons are not safe .
 i see some people keep choosing ,   touching all the ultensils i oso scared .
 imagine he/she is covid positive ,  all the viruses will be on the ultensils that he/she touched .
 go outside must wear diapers to avoid toilets kym ?
 public transport is the lifeblood of the country .
 the spice must flow !
 is it got new clusters liao
 there is no evidence people from overseas spreading covid after isolation .
 we however can deduce that the virus self mutated and matched overseas variants by pure coincidence .
 oh ya forgot the most important evidence .
 pretty sure this “could have” been avoided if borders were tighten (not closed) and handling of high risk arrivals were done better .
 got hawker at food centre totally dont wear mask at all .
 surprising no sda give warning over the whole month ,  as i saw him not wearing mask the few times when i went this hawker centre to dabao food .
 i finally lodged a report on one service app 2 days ago .
 hope nea got take action .
 ban high risks flights
 chiu can forget about one service !
 one service sux big time  .
 edmw oredi came to this conclusion few weeks ago
 idiom - no smoke without fire .
 the analogy of smoke and fire to mean that there is always an underlying cause for any event or situation​ .
 moh should figure  what caused covid transmission at the bukit merah view cluster in the first place instead on how  the covid transmission at the bukit merah view cluster multiples

 my bro spotted !
 ts are chiu ace ?
 if u heard it in edmw and it involves some woman .
 gcp should mean  &apos;golden cheese pie &apos;~  .
 and it &apos;s referring to a woman who thinks she &apos;s the most beautiful ,  most desirable ,  and all man should treat her like a princess .
 it is mostly a derogatory term as it literally means that the woman thinks she has a golden vagina .
 like what woaiguigui said ,   .

 they oni good at mickey mouse tech ?
 how can fight with those big and serious tech companies ?
 there is sgdx coin
 singapore alot of ico  &apos;scams &apos; what
 partior is comin up .
 go ya hor where are all those ico wor .
 that is a private blockchain network .
 memberships will be controlled by ceca
 cool but looks like permissioned blockchain ,  gets oredi got smth similar
 suggest they launch $cpf ,  $tttoken ,  $sgup ,  $clearplates
 govtech oni knows how to tyrannically bully people and get people fired from the jobs for being better than them at their job .
 can have edmw coin ?
 then give the coins to all members ,  new member need new coins then can post !
 haha this might save sph business
 if really do cpf blockchain gahment will keep 51% token ?
 funny right ,  edmw got come may computer scientist yet nth ,  even for fun de .
 i yesterday read a reddit ,  a user dulan with all the crypto scam now create a parody crypto out of spite
 alot of ico are registered in singapore  .
 us ban ico liao leh .
 chiu can create edmw blockchain .
 this ensures that our messages are immutable  do chiu want ?
 later gahment can call chiu to lim kopi
 yes should create singapore own cyber currency so can be used for cpf investment purposes

 satki beach party
 just sums up sinkies ,  humji haha .
 wtf are they doing
 executing the east coast plan
 hum chee ,  got balls to mingle must have balls to stay on .
 ok la police cant catch all so run loh 
 means they guilty conscience else why run
 where &apos;s the part showing them running ?
 ofcos la run must be brave and smart too .
 how come so crowded ?
 all chiong beach sax parties
  &apos;i am here for the party and party i will !
 still holding cup of beer defiantly while being arrested
 next time police must use drone take peekture first .
 run oso no use    feel jin sleepy
 suspect pre covid video .
 seems nobody wear mask .
 if so ,  then the one who post such video are trouble maker .
 the police just need to catch 1  .
 like alot of foreigners
 do the crime ,  face the time .
 yup just need 1 to stay on and he/she can baotoh the rest .
 does this include the plates bowls utensils .
 findings is fast based ?
 where are the facts ?
 that is why i said i hope cos i dont think got much use .
 stopped buying from that stall ,  but issue is that stall always got long q during peak hours .
 so based on this smart  from moh ,  most likely there will be another cluster from this hawker centre soon due to long queues .
 better avoid hawker centres .
 so many people .
 many places during meal time oso long q .
 not everybody can afford to pay food delivery charges for every meal and oso not everybody are able to cook every meal .
 he is inside the stall doing cooking .
 took a pic of the stall n gave detailed unit number .
 suck jokers will still not wear one la .
 so as long as nea bothers to do stealth enforcement ,  he sure kena .
 but if nea bochup ,  oso llst .
 not as if such people tell them oredi got use .
 what the f stupid reason is that ?
 long queue and toilet surfaces will cause transmission ?
 that app for show la .
 i gave up after requesting me to upload this and that .
 so this is the next target .
 no way sherlock .
 i keep my cash ,  dont want your ceca bank empty my balance
 i find the tables much cleaner than before generally .
  sit down ,  not gross ,  the cleaner just need to do a quick wipe if needed .
  so much more pleasant .
  cleaners are oso less stressed ,  less gross out ,  more happy bunch .
 last time they clean your table face black black ,  now they very eager to help chiu clean .
  cos got some spare capacity .
  it &apos;s like anyone working ,  if stretched to the max ,  vs got capacity ,  which more stress ?
 over all ,  positive improvement to diner and clearner lives .
 will get sacked or not ?
 since nothing to do at work
 technically it helps oni during the lunch time .
 u dont have to wait for auntie to clean table .
 thats provided the last person used a tray and dont dirty the table .
 off peak hours is pretty dumb liao .
 if u look at army cook house  .
 is a good example .
 frankly even the auntie can just standby at washing bay .
 if follow cookhouse style .
 just need some rsm to shout at customers
 no sack cos moi oni eating there .
 nowadays tables no more leftover trays and food ,  but table food stains alot cos people couldnt bother to wipe the tables themselves .
 every since it started ,  i dabao .
 not interested to be  &apos;forced &apos; do cleaner job .
 such move benefits the boss most ,  and who are those bosses  ?
 leaders are there not to dictate individual lifestyle .
 using legal means and ways simply show nothing much of such leaders .
 all civil and world class society should not support such means  ?
 worst than any 3rd world governance  ?
 oni benefits the owners since they can cut costs .
 it is all about the money as usual .
 i much prefer to sit down at a table with stains than one with all the leftover gunk .
   and i am sure the cleaners too .
  they really looked much happier and less stressed to me .
 i confirm benefitted .
  much happier with the cleanliness of our hawker centers now .
 i see table now dirtier ,   rik bo lang chap liao .
 aunties all bring wet tissue ownself clean
 whoseh no benefit ?
 now the cleaners jin shiok .
 i just see them stand around doing nothing .
 oni when people come return plate then they clear it from the tray return station
 doesnt take 1+1 to know this .
 well cant do anything about it ,  like they say ,  61% decides everything ,  they can just pass a bill tomorrow saying chiu need to wash your plates before return  ,  chiu oso suck thumb
 this is some brilliant law created by higher echelons that won’t makan at hawker centers .
 i really want to point my finger and laugh at them but i can’t .
 i will never return my tray agin !
 i think the next idea gahment will come out with is ownself bring cloth and must wipe table after eating .
 must wash plates and utensils  .
 it’s a created problem when the gahment stopped bringing in so many foreign workers .
 even so clearing your own table is a good thing .
 we don’t have to stand and wait for cleaners to come by to clean the table these days .
 benefits pap lackeys who open kopitiams and food centres .
 i think chiu need to change the thread title .
 it &apos;s not an initiative anymore .
 it &apos;s a freaking law and chiu will be fined .
 im willing to bet the poster tio bashed with comments along the line of  &apos;how come oni take video ,  got go tell them anot &apos; .
 anyway in before people accuse him of being racist .
 welcome to singapore !
 go home with covid 19 as free gifts !
 they looked so old .
 but why they in a teenage uniform ?
 she looks horny
 we really cookie genes
 angmo jiu shi angmo .
 other peep take photo oso need to pose
 mata will take action bo ?
 angmo can do no wrong
 tiagong majority of edmwers will go to jail for jailbait .
 amdl genes very different ,  age 12 can have bigger cup size and butt than sinkie girl at 27
 this type is integrate on the bed then report them and send them home .
 angmo is the master race  .
 really put most high expectations sinkiebu to shame
 taking stock photos siboh ?
 macam like those simu liu took .
 wa come here bo hiu no respect for our laws but we go their country guai guai must follow
 like this pose .
 amdl usually age faster
 spg see liao oredi wet wet .
 an la they are part of the endemic plan .
 they are here to help spread simi lanjiao exotic variants .
 fastest and bestest and cheeperest way is to do it on public transport
 good friday afternoon all ,  updating to keep the searches going: .
 ts u dont have to update the thread everyday with the same post .

 got post got hope la .
 fb has it own challenges as well if u see the previous posts .
 good rainy monday afternoon all ,  updating to keep the searches going: .
 i recently had sex with one of my long lost ex .
 wa how did chiu manage to track her down after all these years ?
 she tracked me down .
 wa must be hamsum yandao kia .

 got one jump down .
 got one migrated .
 now still got time got energy find the others can talk abt the good old days .
 dont later regret .
 im rooking fer xiao qiang whu last seen at the void deck of circuit lode blk 70
 then no need come up with funny ideas
 u look in mirror loh .
 aceminer korkor is not beta male de
 cleffa is beta or gamma ?
 alpha male are people like lwm .
 have the courage to do the right thing and confront them despite setback and ridicule .
 whereas beta male are the pappies ka kia that hide behind the skirt of institution ,  ball shrink when standing alone .
 lack of character ,  and oni dare to talk behind people back ,  but switch face when confronted .
 those that repeated open thread to whine about their wife and children ?
 when the door to door sales person ask me if they can speak to the head of the household ,  i will call for my wife
 i am charlie male .
 army use alpha , bravo and charlie ?
 im a bravo man
 actually i feel should be alpha n beta at times is better .
 like @jdrevolutionary23 and @nevereatrice
 beta become alpha  .
 all sinkie single men are beta since they can oni get own flat after 35yo
 chiu is sigma male like omikun .
 heng ,  im omega
 false ,  chiu can be high ses and looks like this    .
 i fatter than him  maybe need 20
 thought being alpha is good
 ts which sony mirrorless that she holding ?
 make my tongue moving uncontrollably now .
 the sony camera nice .
 archerly it &apos;s not as if she hadn &apos;t shown frontal view of her skimpy bikini bottoms before ?
 what &apos;s the big deal .
 got underwear what .
 the next level is when u see zaogeng u feel that that area is damn dirty and stinks .
 fuyoh ballet trained
 this atb actually got shave .
 she &apos;s a malaysian chinese .
 she is trying to pang sai or what
 looked different when in mediacok show 3 years ago .
 really look different but still chio
 i wanna merry her
 the aurat is awesome .
 why will lim kopi ?
  i see hw this idea can go a long way and monetize edmw for sph ,  encourage more posting to earn edmw coins  , benefit the old members ,  why not ?
 the more posts there are ,  the more valuable the coins ?
 how about listing the first post of edmw in nft/
 parking app oredi is our bleeding edge .
 now the tt is earth-shaking  .
 i think they could be earmarking it for some nobel prize
 earn coins and spend where ?
 which merchant will accept this and the merchant cash out where ?
 why need to run ?
 just jump in to the waters laa  .
 thatz why we have 3000+ cases daily .
 thought most people overseas oredi ?
 oredi gather in such big group bo hiew the law ,  still wear mask for what lol .
 so are these humji people vax or unvax ?
 currynah who bk ?
 moi just about to post bikini pics on insta ok !
 i oni see $300 potential summon around
 imagine all pay that composite fine .
 9% gst can delay oredi
 at night so happening .
 and i &apos;ll take the party to the police lockup cell !
 kapo one who call the polis
 reminds me of crash and burn .
 money don’t buy class or being a good person
 his wife dreamt he have ferrari ,  so he went to buy one .
 next few generations gonna fail in life just like a weak mental ,  physical n social development .
 i am chio bu i wanna marry him
 is even more satki than johnathon long ah ?
 is jin elite wor
 im an entrepreneur .
 sounds v shady leh .
 no worries ,   can change ownerships to some old fark stay in 1rm rental flat ,  and continue driving
 car chng need to use  ,  chiu ok mah ?
 sounds like chiu know him .
 he reincarnated correctly
 let &apos;s see if majority of edmw bbfas got third eye .
 under la faith in oyk no jinx !
 aos means what ar ?
 believe in ringworm fence strategy .
 in taskforce we thrust
 my guess 51- 80 since today is public holiday so should be lesser test  .
 school not closed yet so still got chance .
 less than yest i hope
 past week number of cases has really increased quite drastically .
 see whether their ring fencing got work anot
 hawkers and fishmongers i know of oni tested yesterday .
 should be higher than 163
 i predict we will see more clusters across hawkers and other wet markets .
 relak ts ,  even ntuc now chiu ownself pack and pay
 ntuc foodfare and foodcourts .
 numbers of cleaners needed for each of them significant reduced (some oni 1 in whole foodcourt now) .
 amy khor job well done .
 protecting the benefit of riches .
 cronies benefit the most .
 i think contractors might reduce the head count for the cleaners cleaning the hawker center s .
 so ,  it would be better to have quota hiring cleaners .
 every 10 tables need 1 cleaners .
 20 tables 2 cleaners .
 need to bring cleaning agent to make the table shine oso rah
 pap oni regulate low ses .
 high ses ,  they are advised oni .
 low ses break safe distance law - jail .
 restaurant - fine few k oni .
 (except the ktvs which make them look bad ,  punished hard)
 why more waste ?
 its a fiasco which serves to divert attention from the critical issues of the season .
 chiu think they care; they met their kpi oredi
 but overseas wise .
 people do clear their own trays .
 no need gahment to set law or impose fine .
 if chiu dont clear your own tray in nz ,  chiu get shouted at by the locals .
 it is not a bad practise ,  to be considerate to the next diner ?
 i mean chiu use public toilet ,  chiu oso flushed (most do) and will be turned off if chiu see an unflushed toilet that chiu will find the other cubicle to use .
 it is the same concept (not asking chiu to wash the toilet bowl/ not asking chiu to wash the dishes) .
 police please note
 the girl on the right looks quite duap liap for her age .
 oni 1 guai guai amdl .
 the rest are flouting the masks on rule .
 time to fine them… .
 wa sit until liddat .
 think other side can see aurat oredi  
 left hand guy looks like steven gerrard
 looks like out of a prawn movie
 look like a scene from america pie
 singapore american school polo t shirts
 man ,  this is really funny .
 where &apos;s the other guy &apos;s eyes staring at ?
 i want to marry both of them !
 their parents can buy 10 of your hdb flats .
 amdl not spotted
 one is wife material ,  one is .
 wow angmo & amdl really photogenic siah … .

 typically used as a sarcastic reply to some posts/comments that chiu do not really care for .
 use it like a +1 .
 this is the oni thread that chiu wont get penalised for digging !
 100 points for the effort sia .
 so gcp referring to bergin cheesepie ?
 it usually refers to girls who think they are exceptionally pretty ,  attractive~  .
 hence deserving even demanding special attention from guys~ .
 this term is generally derogatory .
 beta testers ,  women let them go on trial dates ,  but they need to pay for final product .
 nothing beats the omicron male
 if chiu have to ask ,  you &apos;re beta .
 walk like sissy but thinks its classy and always needing to carry handbags for wife .
 can i be omega .
 sinkie males alpha or beta oso no diff .
 all kena pwn by delta males  
 i thought this is family friendly forum ?
 trust me ,  all it takes is one chao cheesepie encounter and u will be scarred for life to do that again .

 real experts dont really come out and talk much .
 the best subject matter experts for infectious disease are actually those commanders specializing in bio-warfare .
 if they know how to execute bio-warfare operations in other countries ,  they can oso be counted on to counter one in their own countries right ?
 too bad that we do not have paper generals specialising in this subject here .
 i oso play plague inc ,  complete all stages in expert mode liao .

 if those recognise by the press and states never do anything to help what different is there between edmw jjww and them jjww ?

 i used to have a a jippun classmate .

 i was 7 years old back then .

 which school were chiu from and roughly which years ?
 i got one pri school mate from myanmar .
 talked about frogs leaping heights and stuffs .
 silly days but fun .
 i had this ns mate whom i think is the better of all oredi .
 albeit a bit slow .
 often got punished or bullied in tekong .
 i often helped him .
 packed his bag .
 gave him things he lacked for his fbo .
 maybe after a few years i tracked him down on facebook .
 he saw my message but didnt reply .
 i tried again second time a year after .
 oso same thing .
 sometimes some people are not as sentimental as we are .
 or they are going through something they doesnt have time for chiu anymore .
 other than that got another friend .
 quite a slow and weird creepy guy .
 those like always in his own world one .
 you &apos;d think he look creepy and ugly he &apos;d not be so .
 but he begin mixing with small time actor actress .
 or going taking selfies with famous people .
 gave us up as friends .
 even our other mutual friend said he left us .
 people are still people !
 chiu have us ,  bbfas from edmw

 always taking photos with mediacorp actors and actresses .
 apparently he is a calefare there .
   could it be the same person ?
 didnt know so many 76s here  .
 become bb or chio bu ?
 likely bb since u cannot remember
 not looking for anybody but just sharing experience .
 sometimes  &apos;opportunity &apos; finds chiu in the weirdest of places .
 the one im currently dating is one such person .
 she used to be my classmate during sec school(sec 1 - 2) but we were never really that close back then .
 nor did we talk that much to each other but we did play with each other regularly while we were in the badminton club .
 a few years back .
 it was just like any other day .
 got off from work ,  took the bus home .
 dropped off at the usual bus stop but this time round ,  i spotted a lady whom i thought was very familiar .
 she oso spotted me and we stared at each other for a few awkward seconds .
 unforunately ,  i was too shy of a person to even open my mouth and ask so i walked away .
 however ,  i looked back and saw that she was looking at me as well .
 i then turned around and went back to her and asked her in a stuttering manner ,   &apos;are chiu xxx ?
  &apos; she replied yes and oso asked me if i was  &apos;xxx &apos;(my name) .
 we then chatted for quite some time at the bus stop ,  like 40 min or so ,  reminiscing about funny teachers and so on .
 i then noticed it was getting late so i told her we better get back since we had to work the next day but she told that she still had time to spare and i could tell from her tone that she was kind of sad to end the conversation .
 i didnt know what possessed me that day but it was the first time i asked a girl(not counting work purposes) for her number .
 luckily ,  she didnt reject me or ask me why if not i really didnt know how to answer .
 as i headed back ,  i questioned myself why i asked for her number .
 was it cos i  &apos;liked &apos; her or was it cos i just wanted to catch up with a classmate ?
 i didnt have an answer .
 a month later ,  i whatsapp her and asked her if she wanted to meet up to continue our conversation .
 thankfully she agreed .
 i even jokingly  &apos;test water &apos; by asking her  &apos;you got bf or not ?
 later he might get mistaken &apos; .
 she said no have and i was damn happy and it was at that moment i realised i was somewhat infatuated(even if just out of pure desperation for a gf) with her .
 monthly meetups became weekly .
 dinner meetups expanded into activities like playing badminton and swimming .
 slowly and silently ,  we became a thing .
 silently cos neither of us actually ever popped the question about  &apos;going steady &apos; .
 it just happened .
 if people asked us when we started the relationship ,  we oso wont be able to answer cause we cant pin point any specific date .
 dunno if it will last or lead to marriage but even if it doesnt ,  i dont regret ever starting it .
 tldr: dont ignore that ex classmate during that rare moment .
 chiu never know where it might lead to .
 even if it is a male ex classmate ,  he could become your new buddy for games .
 lol surf edmwer for nearly 10 years .
 reading posts 1-4 really makes me laff .

 construction on pasir ris interchange mrt station along cross island line to start in q .
 singapore: construction on the pasir ris interchange mrt station along the cross island line is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2021 ,  said the land transport authority (lta) on monday (apr 26) .
 passenger service is projected to start in 2030 ,  it added .
 a contract worth s$980 million for the project has been awarded to a joint venture between daewoo engineering and construction ,  and the singapore branch of dongah geological engineering .
  &apos;this contract covers the design and construction of pasir ris interchange station and tunnels ,  as well as addition and alteration works to the existing pasir ris station along the east-west line (ewl) ,  &apos; said lta .
 according to the agency ,  the two companies have  &apos;established track records in providing design-and-build construction services for infrastructure such as rail stations and tunnels locally and abroad &apos; .
 in singapore ,  daewoo engineering and construction is involved in the construction of stevens station and tunnels for the thomson-east coast line ,  while dongah geological engineering &apos;s singapore branch is working on the construction great world station and tunnels for the same mrt line .
 travel time savings .
 the first phase of the cross island line ,  covering 12 stations across 29km ,  will run from aviation park to bright hill .
 lta said more than 100 , 000 households will benefit from the new stations .
 recreational areas such as changi beach park and bishan-angmo kio park will be more accessible by public transport .
 commuters can expect to save 20 minutes of travel time from pasir ris to defu industrial estate ,  bringing it down to 15 minutes ,  according to lta .
 travel time between pasir ris and angmo kio is oso expected to be reduced to 25 minutes from the current one hour .
 studies on details of the subsequent phases of the cross island line are ongoing ,  said lta .
 the line will serve existing and future developments in the eastern ,  northeastern and western corridors ,  linking major hubs such as jurong lake district ,  punggol digital district and changi region .
 nearly half of its stations will serve as interchanges with other train lines ,   &apos;making it easier and more convenient for commuters to travel across the rail network &apos; ,  said lta .
 when completed ,  the cross island line will be singapore &apos;s eighth mrt line and the country &apos;s longest fully underground line .
 it is expected to have a daily ridership of at least 600 , 000 in the initial years ,  growing to more than 1 million in the longer term .
 goes to a foreign korean company anyway .
 now 2021 le ,  tiong construction company all no diff from korea or japan or angmo
 i very scared to take canberra station .
 it &apos;s made by tiong company right ?
 any problem the repercussions are magnified .
 small things like certain appliances made in tiong kok still ok
 heng got my bto at pasir ris 1 street across  .
  &apos;my hemsem queen &apos; fren says eventually aviation park mrt is gonna be unofficial  &apos;queens palace &apos; .
 next time wil be ceca contruction company wins
 im sure they oso ask about those things when their daughter fall in love with other race
 younger generations dont ?
 younger generations oredi kena brainwashed by the american libtard attitudes they earnestly ape and worship to look cool and  &apos;progressive &apos;  .
 no wor ,  if like this how to have the indian brudder join jack neo team mens .
 why need brainwash not to be racist ?
 younger folk seem to want to get on in life  ,  meet folk from around the world  ,  dont carry any baggage unless given to them by their parents or older folks in general .
 chiu seem to see racist as a positive trait ,  why is that ?
 as per above topic .
 woodlands 888 cai png stall in coffeeshop next to ntuc fairprice .
 price is cheap compared to all other cai png stalls around this area .
 cook is man or woman ?
 2 veg one meat how much ?
 bus interchange canteen lor
 the oni place chiu can find it will be the cai png stall not operate by jhk .
 so the oni place chiu can find such stall will be in the primary school canteen .
 hong lim level 2 .
 eat not full though
 female helper and server .
 80 cents per veg serving ,  except scrambled egg slice $1 (big slice ,  equal to 2 to 3 eggs) .
 20 per serving .
 fish: $3 to $5 depending on size .
 how does it taste ?
 if taste not nice oso not worth le
 near my house gotch ahtiong cai png stall .
 their curry is cui ,  perhaps not very surprising  
 but must be nearby right ?
 what is the point of travelling far to save 1 or 2 dollars right ?
 transport might oredi be more expensive than that liao .
 cheap and honest dont go hand in hand la .
 their monthly fees should be enough for 10 pwm workers .
 if this picture is real then it pure inconsiderate bad social behavior by any standard !
 ever saw in a park near tnajong rhu park connector ,   a bench near the waters .
 a foreigner angmor was stepping on the bench chair to stretch and exercise and his running shoes were muddy !
 just wondering if these foreigners he/she ever consider if they will do the same in their home country or their own home ?
  anyhow ,  even if they were do this in their own country or their own bed at home ,  these people are in singapore and please !
  citizens in singapore do not wish nor like to sit on the muddied benches in public places .
 strongly urge authorities to have some public social etiqutee lessons for these foreigners when they arrive in singapore whether for leisure or education !
 if not wrong is $3k+ per month
 they will create many jobs for sinkies in the future .
 let &apos;s not be xenophobic and report them .
 smrt paid them $120  
 regardless of how rich or poor ,  all foreigners and pr are guests in our singapore ,  .
 should learn to behave properly here and respect our public property !
 in fact ,  if the picture is real ,  the school (regardless its school fees per month) whethere international school or not and if its worth its salt to be an education center to teach and impart values to the young ,  this young lady should be taken to task !
 she should at least be lectured by the disciplinary master in school for her explanation and then perhaps made to do community service in the school !
 ask yourself ,  if chiu are a citizen and this lady is your daugther who attends hwa chong jc for example ,  what will chiu do and what will the school do ?
 they and ceca are our overlords .
 if u dare complain about them ,  a sham man might call u racist !
 the guy on the right ,  his eyes on somewhere on the girl whom spreads  
 lol i thought they want singapore to be international hub ?
 how to be international hub when the population still so conservative .
 very obvious that they do not treat singapore like their homes .
 it is ok that they create a mess here and expect others to clean up for them .
 think the foreigners who truly appreciate singapore are msians and indonesians ,  and probably foreign workers who took up jobs that sgreans and fts do not want to do
 all the expat children .
 song boh who u voted for
 that amdl is a slug ,  got bf but tempting the other angmo to upz her too .

 the sniper will be caught .
 chiu are probably right .

 after chiu add ,  chiu are indirectly promoting its use .
 then more people will use loh .
 what does  &apos;radish sister &apos; means ?
 or what does  &apos;jjs &apos; means
 radish sister is the sister of radish ,  last time he post his sister pigture here , but censor the face or something liddat ,  since then ,  many white knight want see his sis face  ,  want jio her out .
 thats how the term  &apos;radish sister &apos; come about
 this one got another meaning oso 
 radish sis is notch acronym .
 the function of this thread is to report .
 not to promote wor~ 
 what is the other meaning ?
 what is mean when  &apos;ts go lim kopi &apos;
 oh ,  this is easy and straightforward: thread starter goes drink coffee .
 wow this thread is really an eye-opener , esp when i dont understand half of what some users are talking about , thanks for the effort , ts !
 just keep it alive  .
 i mean the hidden meaning  and where it originate from
 kudos to ts luffymonkey !
 there were some lingos which i got enlighted from your post !
 hope mods can sticky this 
 it means the ts post a thread that may get him into trouble with the police .
 they will call him down to explain things ,  therefore ts will be going there to lim kopi .
 thats what it meant i guess .
 hmm why kopi leh ?
 just a metaphor i guess ,  cos they will be going there for interrogation .
 like in drama ,  police always serve them coffee to keep them awake to keep the interrogation going .
 what is the meaning of csb ?
 wa like quite interesting .
 the person narrating in youtube ,  is it namwee ?
 dunno wor never seen her liao
 i oni have 2 good friends from my childhood era .
 and throughout my entire life ,  they are oso the oni 2 who i can regard as friends
 sorry my friend dont wear specs 
 from seeing her again until chiu 2 steady how long ?
 i dont who where are most of my ex classmates now and how they are doing .
 there were some top students but i dont see them showing up as election candidates .
 like i mentioned ,  we honestly dunno when we officially  &apos;steadied &apos; .
 it just happened ,  i didnt ask her to go steady with me .
 but if i were to hazard a guess ,  it would be somewhere after one year .
 the first year was mostly just infrequent meetups and whatsapp chat .
 later she started to ask me to do more activities with her such as playing badminton .
 i oso started to ask her out more even if i had no solid plan as to what to do .
 thankfully ,  she never tekan me for  &apos;wasting her time &apos; and suggested other things to do .
 i think she could tell that i was just trying to find excuses to go out with her as well .
 we started to hold each other &apos;s hands more often and we didnt even notice it initially cos it didnt seem anything out of the ordinary and we are not the sort to read too much into things .
 for example ,  sometimes i wanted to walk off to look at other things in a store but she would reach out and hold my wrist to stop me from moving away while asking me for my opinion on an item that she is looking at .
 in hindsight ,  thats probably the start of us slowly moving out of  &apos;friendship &apos; and into a more intimate one .
 personally ,  the day i realized we were together was when i realized we were holding hands for a very long time(30 min ?
 ) while out on a meetup at the shopping centre .
 i must admit ,  im quite dense when it comes to bgr things .
 it was the warmth of her hand that made me suddenly realize we were now a thing .
 i giggled like a child inside .
 thats how we  &apos;silently &apos; got together .
 chiu could even say that we  &apos;clumsily &apos; fell our way into a relationship ,  lol !
 just like how blind people feel their way forward .
 i guess two lonely old souls without much of a social circle and a common need to reminisce about the past helped foster the bond between us .
 we were just happy to finally find someone that we can talk to for so long .
 paiseh for the poor explanation ,  im not really sure how to put it in words .
 i stayed in marsiling area when i was young ,  had a really good guy friend and classmate who was really nice to me though he was a bully to others lol .
 we would partner each other for many things and outings .
 too bad my parents shifted house when i was 9 or 10 and we lost contact thereafter .
 another childhood friend i reconnected with from that school oso didnt know where he went  .
 just hope that he is doing well .
 may i ask chiu two how old sia
 coming very close to 40 .
 i know thats not old as a person but in terms of dating and settling down by current standards ,  we are considered  &apos;past our prime &apos; .
 in a way ,  we feel  &apos;old &apos; as well cos we feel that we came from a world that no longer exists and we both have issues communicating with the much younger(20+ and below) ones as well .
 twitter ,  instagram and all that are quite alien to the both of us .
 congratulation for striking toto bro .
 this kind of thing dont happen everyday .
 hope chiu two tie the knot soon !
 thank chiu for the kind wishes .
 yeah ,  i hope so too but after having gone through multiple r/s ,  i have learnt to temper my expectations .
 i think most people oni hear of dating between existing classmates ,  not ex classmates decades later ,  lol !
 great to hear of nice outcomes like these .
 do chiu happen to remember the name of your friend ,  which school were chiu from and roughly which years ?
 i think his name had a  &apos;bao &apos; at the end lol .
 bbfa got friends ?
 maybe from nursery to pri 1 .
 trollsandogres from silng primary school batch 1997 .

 middle-income people oso easily spend 5k on beds oredi .
 employers should allow work-from-home where possible: moh .
 to reduce interactions at the workplace & in public places ,  including public transport .
 so fast u turn oredi .
 if chiu are happy about these things ,  chiu should keep it to yourself .
 it is causing sufferings for others too .

 [sunday]what if macarthur had nuked beijing; no mao campaigns ,  cheena opens up & korea is reunited ?
 this point is of course moot .
 but what if macarthur had gotten his way .
 and the soviets did not intervene .
 what would be the consequences for cheena .
 after the initial devastation and chaos ?
 would tiongkok have avoided mao &apos;s campaigns .
 sparing the lives of those 40-70 tiongs that perished in famines and other mao-made disasters .
 would deng cum to power sooner and open up tiongkok to the world earlier .
 making for a richer and more stable cheena that would have had more time to adjust to the existing world order .
 in a nutshell ,  do chiu think the outcome would be generally positive or negative for the world ?
 what what what ?
  &apos;if oni they would oni let moi nuke them commies .
 another communist leader will rally the entire chinese population to fight against us

 source link down liao 
 balonglong at either end of the train .
 actually ,  what &apos;s the issue ?
 they didnt take up extra seats ,  just that they were sitting very relaxed .
 students being students .
 if say take down masks to talk ,  not like they are the oni ones .
 when i take mrt ,  always can see some people take down and chit chat on the phone .
 but i guess angmo are preferred target right ,  as wont get accused of racism .
 angmo take down mask - necessary to breathe ,  need to talk ,  need to show they got beautiful teeth ,  can sovereign  .
 sinkie take down mask - chao ahbeng ,  act rebel dont follow rules ,  low ses troublemaker ,  if sovereign will make people laff .
 chio bu so nothing wrong
 not wearing masks (properly) .
 authorities ,  please do the necessary .
 amdl is more open minded .
 sinkie women sure leeport police !
 i know the 2 girls .
 first and foremost whoever took this picture is highly creepy ,  could u not have walked up to them and just tell them to put on their mask  ?
 and don’t hit me with the they will say no and tell u to **** off ******** cos none of us talk liddat ,  u tell us to put on a mask we put it on .
 secondly what the **** are u doing photographing minors and then deciding it’s ok to proceed to posting them online without their consent and not have the basic respect or an inch of courtesy to blur their faces ?
 thirdly plenty of locals do this so don’t pinpoint and oni blame us when some of u guys do the same ,  this shaming and blaming **** culture has got to stop in singapore .
 lastly i assume chiu guys know  &apos;pundeh &apos; is a racial slur and so is  &apos;angmo &apos; so to keep the pledge  &apos;based on justice and equality &apos; dont use it dipshits .
 psa:the xenophobia in singapore is real ,  if these were your typical chinese people ,  nothing would be said we both know that
 still not arrested and charged ?

 ​​ocbc says all affected customers of recent sms scam to get  &apos;full goodwill payouts &apos; covering the money lost .
 people walk past ocbc bank during lunch break at the raffles place financial business district in singapore on sep 14 ,  2021 .
 (photo: afp/roslan rahman) .
 singapore: all ocbc customers affected by the recent sms phishing scam will receive  &apos;full goodwill payouts &apos; covering the amount they lost ,  the bank said on wednesday (jan 19) .
 more than 100 victims have received the payouts ,  it said in a statement .
  &apos;we seek the understanding and patience of our customers as thorough validation of each case requires time to ensure accuracy .
 this process is necessary so that every case is fairly and properly treated ,  &apos; said ocbc &apos;s group ceo helen wong .
 she added that arrangements will be made with all affected customers by next week for the payout .
  &apos;we apologise for taking more time than expected to resolve the issues with our customers during this time of distress and anxiety ,  &apos; she said .
 ms wong said the bank has oso proactively reached out to customers who might not be aware that their banking activities were susceptible to the phishing scam .
  &apos;this has helped to prevent another 200 and more customers from falling prey to the scam ,  &apos; she added .
 ocbc first announced on monday that it had begun making “goodwill payouts” to customers who had fallen prey to recent phishing scams involving the bank .
 it did not specify then how much the payouts would be and whether all affected customers would receive the payout .
 according to the police ,  nearly 470 people had fallen victim to the sms phishing scams involving ocbc in december ,  with total losses amounting to at least s$8 .
 the victims received unsolicited smses claiming that there were issues with their banking accounts ,  asking them to click on a link to resolve the issue .
 they were then redirected to a fake website that resembled ocbc &apos;s and were asked to key in their ibanking account login details .
 it was oni after they had received notifications informing them of unauthorised transactions charged to their bank accounts that victims discovered that they had been scammed .
 in a separate statement on monday ,  the monetary authority of singapore (mas) said it takes a  &apos;serious view &apos; of the scam and will consider taking supervisory action against ocbc .
 the authority added that it expects all financial institutions to have robust measures for fraud prevention ,  detection ,  and remediation ,  and to provide prompt assistance to customers who have been victims of scams .
 mas threaten supervisory action liao
 it &apos;s a tough decision but i think it &apos;s the right one ah .
 it &apos;s they fked up
 small $ to them ,  is like payout $0 .
 so next time i got phishing sms i just click oni .
 let the scammer take all my money .
 then the bank pay me back .
 i nothing to lose ,  scammer win ,  bank no cake cause they rich .
 they f up by mind controlling the victims to click the link and to key in use name and password .
 what kind of skill ?

 it all started when the user radish made posts about his sister .
 some people then started to post pictures of pretty ladies and claimed that it is radish &apos;s sister (which radish denied) .
 since then ,  in threads about/with radish ,  people will talk about his sister (as a form of +1 or just to annoy him) .
 : tear piak shoot = tear her panties ,  piak her raw ,  shoot inside .
 if chiu come across any new terms ,  please give me a heads up here !
 oni 1 condition: it has to be commonly used by many people in edmw .
 the purpose of this thread is to report and educate .
 not to promote new terms .

 i heard that it is good to have morning sun shine on us to get some strong healthy vitamins c ?
 oso ,  fengshui pov ,  it absurd positive vibes into your body too .
 if wake up oni pcc ,  considered good fengshui with positive vibe ?
 i think is vitamin d
 i thought its vitamin e
 nope ,  it is vit d .
 i dunno either ,  but at least have a morning sun bath is good for us .
 it might  ,  who knows ,  help to fight covid virus too .
 to build up our body resistant .
 chiu mean like some women tilted their heads ,  expecting the golden shower in the critical few seconds ?
 near the window maybe the sunlight hit a bit .
 yes can even sit on the chair and let the sun shine on your whole body ,  to feel the fresh warm heat going all over our body .
 cannot afford to jiak oily fish ,  so have to get sufficient sun light for free vitamin d .
 dont have to under direct sunlight ,  as long uv is present it will convert cholesterol to vit d .
 of cos ,  direct sun will have higher concentration of uv but i feel we should have sufficient from our daily exposure unless some totally dont have any activity during the day .
 yang qi go into body .

 carousel oso must be taken to task !
 these kind of things cannot steal one .

 steal so many laptops nobody notice ?
 waseh carouhell become the place to offload loots .
 sibei pai mia sia .
 is sinkie cos full name out
 the outsourcing it coy outsourced their it work  ?
 those people who bought ,  the laptop can track back oso .
 all got serial number
 average out $300 per laptop .
 i recall seeing some too good to be true deals on carouhell back then .
 knn this one must rotan gao gao .
 chiu go steal laptop meant for covid work .
 while not a direct employee of moh ,  he was working for an agency engaged by information-technology firm ncs ,  which is contracted to provide it support for moh’s branch office at harbourfront centre ,  his lawyer marina sani said .
 considered as outsource  staff .
 no wonder ,  moh screw up recent qo .
 not enough laptops .
 carousell is just a platform .
 chiu sell what chiu are responsible .
 how come police couldn’t recover most of the laptops sold ?
 surely there’s some digital trace of the exchange’s between the it thief and the buyers ?
 sub sub sub sub con
 imagine your deed and asset all store on blockchain .
 one copy for gahment copies ,  one copy for your own .
 they are testing it at this coming winter olympic game ?
 forgot to share a xi jinping post in weibo ?
 dont have > 2+ children ?
 dont suppork tiongkok land by protesting in angmo cuntry ?
 chiu bank account reset to 0 instantly .
 of course will succeed .
 just replaced whatever currency inside alipay and wechat pay and unionpay and chiu are on your way to global domination .
 the whole point for the tiongs chionging crypto is to get money out of ccp hands ,  not put it inside .
 but mdm should be itchy all over now for an opportunity to buy high sell low .
 when i see the word blockchain ,  i replace it with distributed database 
 distributed db cannot achieve immutability
 must be to reduce corruption .
 if ccp is in control of the blockchain ,  it becomes pointless .
 becuase its the same old story .
 have said many times - .
 brave cowards -  have the balls to do bad things but no balls to own up to it
 but it is really true alot of recent case are female abusers .
 just checking our 158 media alone .
 the myanmar case oso got short link to another 2 domestic abuse cases .
 all female offenders .
 and that is a worrying trend .
 maybe next time before hire maid ,  need both husband and wife to pass a test ,  understand their legal obligations and then can be considered qualified to hire maids .
 this one i think is different abuser .
 this one the maid is bui bui indon .
 smarter than the myanmar ones .
 know how to run away from home after kena beaten ,  then seek help from passer by .
 ya woman touch woman no molest ,  no cane .
 i made the same observation .
 oso some of the most outrageous (non sexual) things like outright lying about molestation due to pay dispute .
 well ,  i suppose most times is the wife ask to have maids ,  and quite naturally the maids ,  when employed ,  cums under the supervision of the wife .
 and then probability that the abuses are meted out by the wife automatically becums higher .
 if the man abuse ,  usually is those of sexual nature ,  and even them ,  the wife may further abuse the maid again .
 i gahment should really think about this necessity for families to have live in maids .
 the number of live in maids in singapore is quite ridiculous .
 every rich or not so rich family oso have reason why they need live in maids .
 worst then the actual abuser ?
 the husband even is police does not means he has 100% control of her .
 since when man nowsaday has complete control over woman ?
 cos maids are ‘cheap’ .
 how do people treat cheap things ?
 with no care and respect .
 maids deserve minimum wages with regulation to ensure low class sinkies treat people like humans .
 people are mean and scary .
 hao siao wont la ,  shameless when abusing the maid ,  shameful when dealing with reporters .
 will she feel shame when being judged by allah anotch ?
 why her hands got red red ?
 chiu think minimum wages will change attitudes towards live in maids ?
 may make it worse whereby people start to think i pay this much ,  must squeeze every drop of work out of the maid .
 the solution in my opinion is to disallow live in maids .
 all maids should be housed into maid oni hostels or dorms and have clearly defined work hours .
 then this shows that low class sinkies deserve partial democracy .
 good idea on getting both to pass the test ,  educate and sign declaration  !
 since when did men these days become so retarded that they are unable to stop and to report on such inhumane act ?
 the act of ignoring is just as bad but on a whole different level cos there was an opportunity that could have changed the course of everything and he didnt act upon it .
 what &apos;s even worse is that he was part of the family and there is no way he was clueless about what was happening .
 if it was an outsider ,  we can put it down to trying not to be kaypoh about other family matters .
 this should not be a gender issue .
 it &apos;s an issue about having integrity and moral principles .
 how come sounds like some plot from a drama  .
 got one recent scene person a comes out of police station and someone went after him and later realised that it was a fake person a .
 the real person a oredi went out by the other exit .
 so she does know how to feel paiseh or  &apos;no face &apos;  .
 then when abuse maid that time never think will gotch this day happen  .
 this is very ingenious
 put her in jail 
 gst 9% goes to paying the propaganda .
 i dont think declining readership is due to underinvestment in talent and technology .
 to attract quality reporters ,  chiu need independence and non-interference
 hui ge is jiak liao bee kia !
 your so-called quality ,  credible journalism oni earn chiu a 160th ranking ,  mr khaw .
 stop being a dog .
 maybe that would help .
 the search for a permanent ceo began almost immediately after khaw became chairman last may .
 he said then that the new smt chief should ideally be sinkie and digitally savvy .
 he or she should oso be someone who  &apos;understands both east and west and is sinkie at heart - and be among the world &apos;s best &apos; .
 end up will be a behkan paper general or ex isd director ,  whose job is just to be a tail wagging lapdog
 conclusion they will up the newspaper price but i don’t read their new pap r now
 umbrage ng ,  chiu wont be missed .
 90% chance is another general get the job ?
 700 million pounds of students hostel gone ?
 have a good feeling new ceo oso surname ng .
 sound like his ex team member who retired from their position after they are not running any more .
 zorro or some one else  ?
 come on new general please
 i nominate @dr .
 vijay or @dragon  for the position as ceo .
 we will make it out of 160th from free press .
 { sph media trust justified in asking for gahment funding : khaw ) .
 { any xyz company is justified in asking for gahment funding : chairman of any xyz company } .
 which company is not justified to ask for gahment funding ?
 which company is not aiming for quality and being credible ?
 these people have no clue .
 simple strategy is to deliver unbiased news .
 and they continually fail to do so .
 digital or not does not matter if the coverage is crap .
 by the looks of it ,  the bravest lion heart beats beneath a kabaya !
 i think u need to train a smart kumlando and not kamikaze kumlando
 train people to disregard safety ?
 8th core value !
 i dont have to .
 i go out in the sun daily
 some vit d facts: .
 your body cant make vitamin d if you &apos;re sitting indoors by a sunny window cos ultraviolet b (uvb) rays (the ones your body needs to make vitamin d) cant get through the glass .
 darker-skinned people have more melanin ,  it reduces the amount of uvb light absorbed .
 darker-skinned people need more time in sunlight to make the same amount of vitamin d as lighter-skinned people .
 many people in india are low in vit d ,  fyi .
 their lifestyle like in many countries in asia ,  is to avoid the sun whenever possible .
 one of vitamin d’s most important roles is keeping your immune system strong so you’re able to fight off viruses and bacteria that cause illness .
 it directly interacts with the cells that are responsible for fighting infection .
 hence ,  vit d is essential to prevent covid 19 infection .
 yes i go exercise every weekday morning except when it is raining or during public holidays like today .
 its a very nice feeling 
 my hse face west .
 there is a movement with the angmo where they suntan their arseholes for health lol
 always lie down naked on my balcony to sun tan
 that’s west sun liao lo
 morning i dont go out de .
 ok la ,  all from same source anyway .
 it’s no longer as yang liao la .
 the energy of the sun has changed oso after late pm
 morning sun is good but sunset type of sun no good 
 no activesg gym slots released for tuesday 10 aug leh .
 moi camped at 12pm to book .
 the whole fitness industry is waiting for sportsg to issue advisory ,  press release .
 they &apos;ll probably oni issue it near midnight later or tomorrow morning .
 so doubt that those gyms fitness studio will be ready to open on 10th ,  especially those require advance bookings .
 but then the fitness industry is believed to be bleeding very badly now ,  so if they &apos;re able to reopen a day earlier ,  they &apos;ll get another day worth of income .
 nice reference ,  will help newbies like me .

 songbo taxpayers ,  ownself fund propaganda for ownself to consume
 correct ,  if they keep bashing the opposition party members like what they did to wp members during cop with those wonderful headlines ,  they will continue to lose at least 40% of readership subscribers ,  lol .

 our fellow edmwer ,  koizumi888 ,  was last seen here on 13th oct 2020 .
 this thread is specially dedicated to reminisce him/her on the 1st anniversary .
 if chiu support koizumi888 ,  please give my post here a like  .
 miss the cat posts man
 probably her work contract in singapore expired and went back home japan
 he/she got chased out by edmwers .
 once again edmw ruin the good things again
 eaten by stray cats ?
 which edmwer drove him out of edmw ?
 seriously was a very hardworking legend
 the sombre thought crossed my mind that one day chiu will see some stop posting cos the person simply passed away… .
  hope he is ok ,  miss his amazing cat gif for every thread .
  and he never posted a single word .
 post cat pic oso kena fixed .
 this shows how bad some sporeans are
 still can post here mah -_- .
 someone from aust (or whatever country) oso posted here gao gao with his garbage .
 until he lost his job
 rotan for abusers ,  dont care female
 cane that biatch !
 must catch the biatch’s son oso ,  dunno got bully others in kindergarten anot
 what is the rationale of female abusers being able to inflict pain and suffering on females and yet escape being caned ?
 if she uses a double to go court ,  isn’t that double charge or something ?
 waiting for zaobao reporters to csi .
 abuse of maids seems to be on the rise or something .
 our law needs to mete out a deterrent sentence on this .
 hope she repents .
 lols  ,  slow build up to next month &apos;s ufo pentagon report
 i am one of those that is eagerly waiting for the report .
 although wont be indepth it will nonetheless acknowledged that the us have had many encounters with uaps and that they know very very little of what or where exactly they are or from .
 always a believer since very young .
 knn then fire at it la scared wat
 the indepth versions will never released .
 the way they announce is very skilled  ,  very slow no caused panic  ,  oso  &apos;leaks &apos; are probably sent out to test reactions first .
 if no reaction from public  ,  then say its taken from pentagon .
 if mass panic  ,  just say its fake .
 and its always very far from the cities  ,  as if land dont have radar and nightvision
 human have not yet discovered hd cameras .
 they should just piang piang then see how
 difficult for the usa or western  &apos;democratic &apos; powers to admit .
 but they are really some prototype russian secret military vehicles testing the limits of us military defenses .
 maybe even those pesky commies in cheena .
 these are black projects
 usually is all lens errors or optical illusions .
 obviously u didnt watch the video .
 the radars backed up the detections .
 covid may be a virus sent by the aliens to soften the battleground first .
 people asking for hd video didnt realise the video is probably taken from far away using zoom .
 it is not like the alien showing in front of the navy close up ,  they are simply zooming to see far away upon detected by radar ,  using their camera which causes pixelation/blurry image .
 maybe wait for the alien to want to get close up shot and shakehand while taking pic ,  we will have nice video/pics then
 stupid thing to do to an advanced aircraft .
 usually when detected ufo ,  the camera will auto record in 240p
 it &apos;s probably hollywood
 ufo at iran in 1976
 ufo no stealth ?
 seems like ufo oni appears in usa
 heng suay kia - heng or suay ?
 a very intense week !

 154 refers to mediacorp (aiyah the news agencies in general la) cos they were ranked 154th in some freedom of speech survey .
 fl is freelance .
 in edmw ,  generally if a guy refer gal fl meaning the gal is freelancing as a part time hostess/whore .
 therefore ,  fl in edmw means a freelance pros .
 eg:  &apos;a fl did a bj on me last night &apos; means  &apos;a part time whore did a blow jo* to me last night .
 hope this explanation is clear .
 thanks for the clarification

 and whoever sleep with ‘her’ ,  next morning wake up sure punch that face until its flat .

 ah gong property oso dare to steal tsk tsk .
 crazy gahment money oso dare to cheat
 maybe this guy is a foreign worker .
 how can someone with it background be so freaking dumb to sell at such low pricing .

 so those happen to buy it how ?

 ah biao was from class 1a and 2a .

 from 16years old to 36years old ,  u still can recognise her .
 guess she’s still short and petite .
 aiya why no walk over and say hi .
 i think the big neh netball player is serene .
 we always standby the front and back of our classroom when she walked past to see the side view .
 though her face not really chio .
 the other tall slim gal called xiao li .
 her neh really small .
 heard from his then bf that she stuff tissue paper in her bra… .

 anyone knew lin shi han from chij and attending engrish tuition class at john aron in plaza sing  .
 your dad &apos;s old playing cards ?
 u must be really young ,  how come u can relate to the days without handphone and tech ?
 @mindset1976 maybe chiu want to put up a google doc somewhere easier to view the  &apos;requests &apos; lol .
 anyways ,  some childhood memories are good ,  some are bad .
 people come ,  people go .
 sometimes chiu have to lose something/someone to appreciate what it is like to have something/someone .
 used to have some good pals until i went overseas and just liddat ,  contacts slowly dwindled to zero (no social media back then) .
 still remember the pri school girl who has the same birthday and we give presents to one another .
 the naughty guys who play truant with and go long kang catch fish .
 or go swimming at big splash (that time at chinese garden) .
 the two smart alecs in my class who were rich (i think) and snobbish .
 the guy playing with lab equipment during science practical  .
 my juniors in cca .
 a bmt pal (same company different platoon) staying in taman jurong .
 those bmt bunk mates .
 but now ,  all are just memories .
 some say singapore is small ,  but actually is not that small .
 actually some memories are best kept that way instead of catching up in real life ?
 how to setup the google doc maumu ?
 think i not tech savvy enough to pull it off .
 i can relate to your 2nd point ,  swimming at mitshikoshi garden (i think that was what it was called) ,  and your point 4 ,  had a classmate who actually hurt himself burning things up in the chemistry practical .
 chiu grew up in the west area as well ?
 aiya why dont u go pandan reservoir for a dip

 msm = main stream media .
 distribution channels that most consumers are exposed to .
 newspapers ,  tv ,  radio .
 when used by netizens ,  it is usually in a dismissive tone ,  and relates to media bias and propaganda .

 9% to refer to people who defends the gahment  .
 ib can oso mean internet banking though .
 saw it at singapore bike forum

 ufo aliens knows oni to look for usa ,  the rest of the country they don’t touch
 it &apos;s just star trek folks from the future coming back to visit us .
 may be russia spy drone ?
 so goh meng seng is right all along !
 there are two reasons for it .
 less likely first .
  if it &apos;s really an alien spacecraft ,  i doubt anyone wants to start an interplanetary war .
  if the officer is not confident of shooting it down ,  he does not fire cos if it is really an enemy spy aircraft or drone ,  the weakness of the weapons system has been revealed .
 if it is really aliens .
 why are they here ?
 earth is like the backwaters of the milky way galaxy .
 we are not even at the center of the galaxy .
 active surveillance cos humans show propensity for violence ,  even against each other .
 and if humans acquire same tech as aliens ,  we could invade alien worlds ?
 if humans initiate contact ,  would they say “we come in peace ?
 ” in history ,  when a more advanced society meet a less advanced one ,  the less advanced one is annihilated .
 do we really want to initiate contact ?
 why ufo oni contact with u .
 s and their military .
 why 2021 but still got potato cam ?
 if those aliens come here sure will be caught on camera and posted on singapore vigilante or stomp
 really have ah ?
 never see any ufo in singapore before .
 yes ,  aliens should exist .
 but they hardly will bother to intervene with humans
 long story short .
 according to theorists ,  they came before then  left promising to return ,  however over a long period of time people has forgotten/hidden the past .
 so now they are returning but beginning by slowly letting us know of their existence .
 be mentally prepared .
 ufo seems to oni find usa ah
 well ,  if it is really aliens ,  let’s hope they are not planning an invasion .
 humans have no chance .
 this might be true .
 but it would take while for them to get approval to return .
 they oso have to report to higher authorities far from earth that might take a while to reach as well .
 there are several reasons why potato cam are always deployed in situation like these .
 one of them being able to flip prata according to the situation .
 if full hd so clear until  &apos;alien &apos;s dick hairs oso can see &apos; type of camera ,  no way to flip prata liao .
 the reason why us is admitting to these encounters and declassifying reports is cos the secret cant be kept any longer .
 it is going to be very exciting .
 the us navy encounter ones most likely is the friendly aliens .
 hostile aliens ones won’t announce themselves so easily and get detected and send for analysis ,  they will probably go for a fullscale assault right away .
 cheena new aircraft .
 uhhhh so expensive now
 just eat hello panda lo
 this huan v nice !
 dont get it as to why this kiddy snack is acty being enjoyed by male adults  
 prefer hello panda .
 always buy the 6 single pack offer ,  cheaper than the giant pack offer ntuc selling .
 never understand why .
 recently they finally wake up and change the price but iirc ,  still single pack cheaper .
 $6000 oni ,  the roi is extremely low .
 ncs name so smelly still got people want to work for them ,  seriously don’t understand .
 their ability to hire behgan people is legendary .
 i know of someone quit an it support role in a gahmen related agency and joined ncs .
 this joke’s quality of work is so shit that all his former colleagues damn glad he left .
 the laptops probably bnib .
 moh buys first just in case they need to hire more people to do all the contact tracing and other covid work .
 when covid numbers increase and they need to hire more people ,  they just need a day or so to program the laptop .
 but never emphasised is sinkie .
  &apos;muhammad fakhrurradzi mohamed omar ,  25 ,  was jailed for 11 months on thursday (aug 5) after pleading guilty to three charges of theft &apos; .
 21 laptops ,  they oni recovered two ,  means he sold 19 laptop for $6380 .
 worlks out to $335 per laptop !
 he sell so cheap !
 i wonder why police never go after those who bought the stolen goods and ask them to recover back hmmm
 some of the laptops were brand new .
 i &apos;ll bet most were not new .
 thats why in storage .
 and thats why he stole them ,  cos he thought were obsolete write offs no one would notice .
 in my security guard job see so many cases .
 lawyer oso exaggerate value in court .
 like lost is 33k cos gahment need to buy 30 new sets instead of reusing unwanted models .
 gahment paid ncs $15k per head count per month .
 ncs paid outsource company $7k per head count/month .
 the outsourced company paid salary to this chap ,  $3k/month + cpf .
 thats why he stole laptops .
 which edmwer was it ?
 sound desperate sia  
 if they revealed the whole name ,  it is confirmed sinkie .
 do part time grabfood or foodpanda oso more worth it
 thought it &apos;s a delta .
 i think original title should be it support engineer then somehow all the news media can change until it engineer
 he should have stole those hpb trackers ,  maybe they would even thank him for selling instead of letting them go to waste
 sinkies commit more kwime ?

 if your household circumstances permit ,  please allow and encourage your mdw to take her rest day on a weekday
 employer will say they doing their job by minimizing outside social gathering .
 can be quite impossible if working adults with children or elderly to take care of .
 fortunately ,  my mum &apos;s maid doesnt like to go out .
 she rather stay home on weekends .
 got free wifi ,  netflix too .
 stop using encourage and just mandate .
 employer to mom: please let us import more fts to replace married sinkies who cant work on weekdays
 allow and encourage = not law = no need to hiew
  bangala bf off oni on weekend .
 my maid said nobody will piak her on weekday

 yes us most likely encounter are aliens high tech probes .
 probably means the aliens are either on the way or preparing to come here ,  depending on the size of their fleet will take a while to reach here .
 report have  ,  next month .
 obama oso say have  ,  but he oso also said he dunno what it is .
 any living species that are capable of traveling great distances knows that life is precious .
 so most should be friendly .
 many kinds of speculation .
 we never know ,  we could be farm animals and it is just time for harvesting .
 no big fuss ,  500yrs later we oso will have that
 hai i am sure will just be another anti-climax report .
 easier to say ufo than admitting foreign countries have tech they’re not aware of ?
 unidentified flying object mah ,  true what .
 they say is ufo cos some of the orbs on radar can go vertically up down 100km in few second  .
 like a bouncing ball liddat  .
 no known human chemical propulsion like rocket or jet engine can do that emergency brake and change direction 180 degree
 this is considered big news .
 100+ pages thread worthy .
 usually i am very skeptical about ufo ,  but the recent confirmed footage really got me interested .
 hope the congress report release soon
 cos usa: ufo sighting area
 must be aliens that bought covid to earth from their alien world oso right ?
 check on experiment/pets ?
 i remember for one movie line where the fellow ask another guy why is it that photos of extra terrestrial or super being always blurry .
 forgot what is the movie .
 no matter how sceptical i am about this ,  i feel cannot be so arrogant as to think earth is the oni planet with life forms .
 just wonder whether will really see visitors from a galaxy far far away in my lifetime .
 what news they trying to distract today again ?
 not these shit again
 some crazy people says in 1960s ,  alien chosed us ,  several presidents rejects ,  but 1 signed a treaty .
 allows them to interact in human form .
 objective is perfect their offspring ,  study human .
 us would cover up their sexposures even as to human abduction research .
  in return ,  technology share to us .
 so far crazy people says coincidentally , those assaunated presidents are those not favourable to the treaty .
 area52 oso has leaks ,   its a multi storey underground complex ,  each floor with different zone purposes .
 apollo moon landing was oso watched by unknown flyers .
 when rover explore the dark side of moon ,  it was liberally too wanderous on  &apos;others backyard &apos; .
 until taught some lessons rover damaged .
 arm string said ,   &apos;we come in peace &apos; .
 human never land on moon after that deem ,   &apos;unsuitable for colony &apos; but actually no budget to substain space prog .
 these are the inspirations for movie ,  transformers ,  mib ,  apollo .
 good night story for ufo fans .
 i oso faint when i come across these

 year 1991 bedok pri school pri 6k .
 gwee ya mei ,  i love chiu !
 no have marco van basten ,  jurgen klinsmann and roberto baggio ?
 chiu know them too  ?
 are we from the same school  ?
 do chiu remember totti  ?
 last time he always make fun of us .
 and we would make fun of him too .
 but actually i think totti is a great guy .
 very kind and fun guy to hang out with .
 wouldnt mind meeting him again .
 wonder whats he doing now  ?
 lotibun looking for bedok primary school 1991 batch class 6k ,  classmate gwee ya mei .
 hi perhaps i can find my class primary school classmates .
 i had no friends as im super naughty notorious in school that no one wants to be friends with me   .
 i can oni remember a few classmate names (which i may not spell correctly also) .
 kuan baoling - always disturb her in class as she &apos;s my first crush .
 alfred - a chinese whom is always mistaken as indian due to his extremely dark skin .
 every start of the year teachers always ask him same question  &apos;are chiu chinese or indian ?
 joshua - quite a nice kid but i think i lost his gameboy during p3 or p4 .
 i was accused of stealing the gameboy .
 rosabella - talkative girl .
 was made to kiss the boy sitting beside her by the teacher cos they kept talking to each other in class ,  termed  &apos;kissing fish &apos; .
 regan - not sure classmate anot ,  i think so .
 stays in potong pasir and we attended same tuition together at cc under a hdb block .
 near block 105 .
 ming ee - i think the oni  &apos;friend &apos; i have cos he gave me his number and we chatted .
 benjamin -  &apos;friend &apos; from another class we sat and talk on the same school bus home .
 oso stays potong pasir .
 xuefen - i pour entire water bottle over her head on the bus for the fun of it .
 tio whacked by bus driver .
 tina - friend of kuan baoling ,  they always hang out together .
 a very small sized cute girl .
 thats all i can recall for now .
 why still need to mark up the food prices so much  
 platform might charge a fee ,  of course pass it down to chiu .
 packaging might oso cost more .
 oso need some buffer against chaokuan losses like delivery man makan your food then chiu complain portion very little ,  or chili sauce not enough and chiu demand redelivery or refund .
 simply greed loh .
 whatever  &apos;buffer &apos; is not true .
 those  &apos;chaokuan &apos; losses dine-in will kena one .
 u paying part of the fee shops pay the platform .
 last time when starting they all bluff u all by setting price cheap cheap ,  got discount here got promo there .
 now they know u all hook on their service liao llst bohbian any price oso pay
 shops need to pay +30% to platform
 chiu think your measly $3 covers the cost of rider sending food to u and packaging meh ?
 platform fees + convenience fees
 chiu think your $3 so big can cover the guys waited 30 minutes and cycle 3km just for chiu ?
 cos u onli paying the driver  ,  not grab himself
 hawker need to pay commission to the delivery platform .
 why will they absorb this cost ?
 if absorb is make huge lost liao as their margin very thin so off course charge u for it on top of delivery fee .
 not happy ,  u go buy yourself loh
 shops pay around 30% of the sales to food delivery platform ,  so they makeup their prices to cover the loss .
 by the way it &apos;s not grab or the delivery company who markup the price .
 all food prices are set by the shop themselves .
 food delivery company simply just take a 30% cut off their final price .
 there are shops that actually dont markup their price at all ,  but it &apos;s quite rare .
 platform ride customer ,  ride rider ,  ride merchant - so the cost pass down .
 how much u pay for delivery charges ?
 the delivery guys get $5 .
 5 to $9 per job .
 havent count incentive yet .
 u think grab or panda so good top up for u ?
 want convenience then be prepared to pay for it .
 many people don’t care about that markup thus they markup song song .
 gahment ride companies > companies ride customer/merchant/deliveryman .
 it &apos;s liddat one .
 those can afford will still order .
 chiu usually order from which platform
 ignoring the topic of mayor salaries and how many  &apos;hats &apos; they wear ,  the real question should be how do cdcs fit in the convoluted grassroots structure .
 we have pa ,  rc ,  cdc etc ,  it is hard to keep track which agency does what ,  which one has political appointees and which one is  &apos;apolitical &apos; etc
 up for the lunch crowd
 there is so much redundancies in the gahment ,  no wonder things are done efficiently
 i can tell chiu within the pa grassroots oso messy with many layers of red tapes .
 residents comcare applications from pa throw to cdc ,  then to msf ,  then msf throw back to pa
 all is promote pap one  .
 the police recovered oni two laptops upon his arrest .
 as usual no blame culture in moh ?
 how many did he steal ?
 is that why every day the reports later and later ?
 hmm bro it seem u dunno how gahment procurement process .
 hardware cost 1k per machine .
 security app/hardening cost 500 per machine .
 onboarding cost another 200-300 per machine .
 the above is just illustration .
 tech companies &apos; definition of an engineer is someone who creates something .
 network engineer creates network topology ,  etc .
 someone who maintains and repairs are technicians .
 are those stolen laptops the reason why the daily data keep getting delayed in release ?
 actually come to public services ,  stat boards these assets matter yea computer ,  equipments etc is very very messy .
 thus this is why ago always can find flaws every year .
 ahgong $ can oni steal expendables ,  like a4 paper
 so those who bought need to return ?
 lor this is what i curious .
 so spf now trace back from this seller who he sold the the laptops to and recall back but got refund the money ?
 whoseh singapore no talent ?
 then just say sell to others liao who sell to others who sell to others
 chiu cant say they know it &apos;s stolen goods
 how smart u expected him to be ?
 can hit kpi for them then  .
 not surprising ,  private oredi can be quite cui ,  what’s more gahment .
 unless u tie the ownership to the staff ,  if not the elephant went missing in the room oso nobody realise one
 nickel ng must be laughing at him
 used to work in ncs for moh vertical
 alamak abang bodoh sia .
 steal from gamen and expect to get away ah ?
 what a kumgong kia
 this was very stupid indeed ,  items valued at $33 , 000 but sold on carousell for oni one-fifth of the price at $6 , 680 .
 yeah ,  but if its stolen goods ,  they will need to return it (especially since its gahment property) .
 not sure how they will get compensated ,  but i guess they probably need to file a case with the seller
 pity those who bought the laptops .
 probably got police knock on their door and make them return the laptops .
 ts u mean 150kg ?
 depends on spend on what .
 if bo dai bo ji lose the money ,  then it &apos;s alot of money to lose .
 but if spend on something i like ,  then is ok
 50 packet i can eat 50 days   i everyday 1 meal only
 why 1 meal a day nia ?
 dunnid travelling ,  etc  ?
 if spend on food 150 can go maybe 2-3 weeks ?
 but if spend on hobbies 150 can be gone in split second .
 alot i can buy 50 kway peng
 thats less than what i spend on 1 pax dinner on weekends .
 go settle your groceries in a supermarket ,  then see how much u &apos;ve got left  .
 unless u &apos;re a freeloader
 150 is quite short 
 but working in cbd will get high pay 
 chiu cum so fast  ?
 cubbie jin  rich .
 have to be objective and measure according to set rules .
 could this 150 be used in better avenues such as changing someone life for the better (opportunity cost) ?
 how often does the event to spend 150 occurs ,  is there a limit to it (scarcity) ?
 are there any other ways chiu could derive the equivalent level of benefits from some other sources (substitute) ?
 welcome omicron to singapore !

 yup ,  fox mulder was right after all .

 lol couldnt agree more
 delivery fee goes to the delivery guy .
 then company do for fun ?
 of course they earn from the markup that chiu willing pay .
 its the very simple logic of can whack just whack .
 usually there will be a 40% increase in food prices from dine in vs delivery .
 there is a delivery fee of $4 .
 platform fee and small order fee of $3 .
 say food is usually $5 ,  grab will be $7 .
 grab take 50% of food price
 arbo u think they so free help the hawker promote the food for free ah haha
 no offer no orler

 so if unvax kena covid ,  can go hospital and claim insurance ?
 they want repetition .
 discovered a webpage to complement this thread here .
 but what &apos;s this  &apos;ipoh horfun &apos; i see in quite a number of threads ?
 any special meanings to it ?
 or it &apos;s just plainly the food name ?
 this website has been around for quite long ,  but think is no longer being updated .
 certain edmwers corlick he very close to .
 what is polopikaworldmap ?
 quick whisper from little blue bird on grapevine told me this: .
 ipoh hor fun refers to a female colleague of siaokau369 (previously bengkia369) whom he claims is interested in him .
 she is from ipoh and edmwers hence nickname her ipoh hor fun .
 this video explains it very well~ !
 this i really have no idea .
 where did chiu see it being used ?
 google seems to think it means  &apos;political world map &apos; 
 when poloboiboi was suspected of pika worldmap777 .
 so polopikaworldmap = poloboiboi piak piak worldmap777 ?
 cant find this term in any threads .
 think it is not popular~ 
 thanks so much !
 minah should refer to a  &apos;malay girl &apos;
 rcp : real cheese pie (see cheese pie) .
 happy new year  .
 to all supporters of this thread !
 fbt is a brand of sports apparels commonly worn by students .
 many edmw males have a fetish with females in fbt shorts~  .
 probably cos the shorts are really very short~  .
 why never update popular terms like mlmlwm ?
 im enlightened finally !
 haha thanks for this awesome thread

 we are in the biggest crisis in the short history of singapore .
 our dear pm is hiding and nowhere to be seen .
 is he trying to protect what is left of his lousy reputation ,  after being pm here for so many years and having achieved nothing good to his name ?
 he is truly the biggest liability to our pisai country .
 under her empress ?
 thought he jin busy thinking how to fix the opposition ?
 isnt that the job of pofma minister shammugum ?
 she bz spending state money to buy her popularity and relevance .
 dont think shan ge can do without permission from higher up .
 in his ivory tower as usual
 busy analysing whether to invite brother and sister for cny reunion
 maybe dead liao .
 last time got site monitoring lky health .
 no site monitor pinky ?
 u see his face recently on tv .
 macam like aged 10 years and looks like some ah pek that plays chess at neighborhood rc .
 in the tunnel between istana and oxley lor .
 heard they have top quality murthabak and nasi goreng inside there .
 probably planning clan reunion .
 of more than 5 visitors
 if he is in poor health then he does not have the capability to lead the country .
 the responsible thing is to give up his pm seat .
  oso for public interest he should declare his health problems .
 the dynasty must live on .
 ho jinx needs to maintain her wealth and relevance .
 without the accompanying merit of course .
 too desperate without thinking of the consequences .
 probably due to gambling debts like soccer bet ,  4d ,  toto or owe ahlong thus resort to such desperate measures ?
 believe don’t have means don’t have ,  very good .
 belief is all chiu need ,  no need to track down buyers and investigate .
 maybe this is not laptop theft ,  but information theft
 should be borrow ahlong to gamble , if dont pay , ahlong go his house disturb his wife and child .
 should be gamble le , rws is near his office
 lol ncs sub con .
 same sentiment ,  arbo couldnt be so desperate & risk his rice bowl and going to jail
 how he steal them ?
 valued at 33k sold for 6 .
 best carrousel seller award winner .
 most probably le ,  then 4d toto counter oso near his office harbourfront oso .
 really is lelong sales sia
 but strange thing is , he scared ahlong disturb his wife and child , but not scared he go jail cannot see his wife and child ?
 not sinkie isit ,  if is will print big big
 thats like 300 per laptop ?
 sell to friend and relative friendly price ?
 u never pay enough then will have this crime .
 imagine u pay him 10k per month then wont have such problems .
 minsters were right .
 this not 1st case for sub con le ,  wonder does the hiring company realise the pay  not high enough for these engineer ?
 most probably his pay 2k oni .
 if his pay 10k he wont steal le ,  got nice life who want to be beggar
 probably ahlong will send his hench man to hantum him or threaten him at home and office .
 in jail his wife and children can still paid him a visit and reconcile after release so long he settle his debts  
 moh staff or outsourced staff ?
 angmo is lucky that he didn’t get laped .
 and he said he couldn’t
 heng reason is age .
 u think he can ?
 he dont want to .
 is dont want .
 tharman is smart not dumb .
 round one cannot take .
 sinkie pm is too small fry for him ,  he aiming to be imf chief .
 he himself rule himself out liao  .
 gahmen said we are not ready for a non chinese pm .
 chiu go ask them why so racist .
 cos he not chinese .
 i feel he is overrated .
 east coast has a plan ?
 cause sinkies are racist and don’t want an indian pm
 looking at the bunch of  shortlisted ,  he the better candidate
 he is good ,  zero scandals and he speaks very carefully .
 now it &apos;s oredi bad with the ceca treaty .
 wait for old generation to die la .
 or jitao heck care  &apos;old generation &apos; ,   they are going to die anyway .
 math and statistics will take care of that .
 hype is dead lol
 thot it &apos;s at paya lebar square ?
 is a fad ,  like last time the taiwan castella cake oso .
 now the tiger sugar oso no people q oredi .
 yes ,  i like sanchen too but it’s oso quite ex .
 chiu can see their containers and packaging all one notch above the rest .
 their icy lemon drink is best liao
 overpriced overly sweet syrup with ice .
 both xin fu tang and sanchen nice for me but really not cheap .
 i rate sanchen slightly higher than xft .
 i buy their fresh milk with brown sugar boba ,  taste really tok kong ,  the others like liho ,  gong cha and koi doesn’t come close at all
 their ximending outlet is good .
 but i try at compass one once .
 drink oredi feel sick .
 never ever buy again
 business doesnt add value should all toh .
 good to see taste bad when drink .
 the novena one opened slightly before covid oso gone .
 their drinks like drinking sugar water .
 better close all of them
 too many bbt liao  .
 not good for kidney and liver
 never drink before
 im ashamed to say this i have never tried any brown sugar version but i did had xft other drinks ,  taste pretty ok to me .
 sugar level i think can custom but not too sure for brown sugar bubble version though .
 what do chiu think about boba tea ?
 lol yea their cwp outlet not much queue 1 .
 even boost got more customers queuing .
 this kind of shop specialist in selling brown sugar milk tea oni wont last long
 i heard it &apos;s long queue all the time .
 but each time in compass one and there &apos;s no one at all .
 all bbt should be closed
 then everyone will learn the feeling of how one hour of work not even enough to earn a big mac meal .
 then when these people become ministers they will decide whether that is good or bad .

 if i am younger 20 years old ,  i may need disney .
 i got channel 8 ,  who need  .
 i got netflix ,  hbo go and prime .
 they are famous for being very protective of their own products
 can subscribe direct bo ?
 till now still no sound no music .
 moi not going to subscribe to starfug just to watch disney+ .
 decentralized vpn ftw .
 just subscribe from the app when it &apos;s available on 23rd feb .
 no need starhub .
 same as netflix ,  no need singtel .
 can watch on andriod tv ,  lg tv ,  samsung tv ,  iphone ,  android phone ,  web browsers ,  etc .
 thanks ,  was hoping to subscribe direct to avoid using vpn (i m on vpn to watch disney+ now) .
 i doubt their content will varies for different region .
 seriously ,  i oso tried vpn to other countries like japan ,  germany ,  usa ,  etc .
 no much difference actually .
 for japan and germany ,  there are some movies and animes i want to watch ,  but dont have the engrish subtitles option .
 so actually netflix singapore is a better one as we have engrish ,  chinese ,  malay ,  etc subtitles for most movies/series .
 hope epl launch their own streaming service soon .
 one shot take down singtel and starhub .
 scared trying - if vpn ,  wont work still bro ?
 my got myownflix .
 why i need disney ?
 netflix oso said the same thing
 i got prime and netflix ,  disney+ got simi content is geo lock de .
 the movie belong to them the distro is them also
 disney so little new content .
 somemore each new ep up 1 or 2 days bukit timah hill oso got liao .
 subscribe indo ,  $20 one year lol .
 but the app oni available on indo app store and play store .
 they partner with ceca hotstar app though ,  sucks .
 but disney plus not much diff between countries .
 hbo max vs hbo go got quite a big difference though ,  haven’t launch in asia .
 moi is cheapskate .
 anything oso sail the 7 seas .
 doesnt affect me .
 disney knows ahtiong n kimchi sure will kop the videos share on bt .
 ok then what is cm ?

 is cbb an acronym ?
 bumps to keep thread alive
 this thread used to be stickied isnt it  ?
 guess it fell off  .
 no more sticky ?
 is time for a new change .
 no more those moron engrish anymore .
 bumps thread to prevent being pruned
 anyone knows what is btblp
 all sound atas & class .
 words that begins or sounds really satki to moi  
 i oni know orifice
 oracle sucks ,  use sap instead .
 larry ellison sends his regards and thanks .
 ts is orpisai’s clone ?
 whenever i think of oracle ,  i think of that scene in the movie 300 .
 my oracle always freeze or errors .
 google oracle of omaha .
 well ,  he is not a hardcore marxist .
 he &apos;s a demonstrated progressive and had proven himself straight up to the face of pinky ,  he &apos;s not a marxist .
 wait until all of them die then singapore can move forward ?
 cant be right ?
 but anytime we are ready for non chinese president
 if tharman really become the pm would taman jurong a hot location for investors
 he is quite smart .
 low profile means he can get to keep his political legacy .
 sort of understandable why he didnt want to risk becoming hero to zero .
 moi get that he is more charismatic out of the current bunch but the things he say is the same stuff .
 the non chinese thing is just a lame excuse .
 temasek ceo oso indian .
 age is an excuse ,  ge results is the key factor
 at least not a yes man .
 he violated osa leh .
 its one thing insai glc/mnc another thing when we are talking about an inner circle of elites who literally wield absolute power and draw millionaire salaries wor 
 genuinely loved by his constituents ,  respected on the world stage .
 if this was an open election tharman would win in a landslide .
 is it still in jurong hill or moved to mandai wildlife reserve liao ?
 i booked using srv then the tickets show mandai wildlife reserve .
 money not enough ,  around $2k so go steal ?
 yet some say company must profit than can pay employee well .
 should be ahlong will force his wife to work sex trade for him if he dont pay up .
 so now at least he paid up , his wife dunnid work sex trade .
 but now problem is he not working for 10 month le , no income how his wife and child survive ?
 after come out jail oso hard to find job le how he support his family ?
 reminded me of a recent case where a childcare sup or principal oso resort to makan the centre monies  
 if oni moi bought these cheap stuffs
 there alway grab and food delivery waiting for him or he can work for eighteen chefs .
 benny se teo will take him in .
 but he in jail cant work for 10 month le , if wife is housewife then how to survive ?
 principal salary should be high oso steal money ?
 stupid to the max
 greed lor ,  some people work as lawyer ,  accountant ,  bullion and stock trader oso cheat and run off with clients monies
 daring siah this guy .
 ncs oso got hire 21 stabs right ?
 please be fair to ah bang and rehire him after coming out from prison .
 yellow ribbon is gender neutral
 should be oso threaten by ahlong le
 who is 21 stab ?
 last time oso a subcon work school it engineer , steal school laptop sell .
 jail few month .
 after come out still can get a higher pay job with lta he told me
 not everyone is threaten by ahlong .
 the it engineer high chances ,  imagine 21 laptop price at 30k and he sold it off at 6k and risk losing his job and going to jail .
 lawyer ,  bullion and stock traders if they run off with clients monies usually is more than that and most are prepare not to return
 just 11 months .
 too many different bbt outlets oredi .
 more to close soon i guess .
 find their brown sugar pearls too nua ,  bought once or twice when they first came .
 i like milksha tho ,  either buy their sesame or taro freshmilk usually .
 too much competition here
 bbt hype die down liao .
 now is coconut drinks
 well sinkies are always into hypes .
 expand too fast .
 lawyer can run to south america country le , for ah bang where can he run ?
 darn ,  cannot mention the name .
 i see oni diabetes
 too ex and dont like brown sugar
 too ex and too many competiton .
 those cheaper brands still surviving .
 xin fu tang boring one trick pony .
 chiu want real high quality bbt drink chicha san chen
 ex i cannt buy le
 think bbt will die slowly ,  cos now the trend is coconut drinks
 i think the ones should close down are koi & liho .
 koi doesnt taste like when it was first started .
 liho drinks are messed up with all the overly sweetened cream ,  cheese ,  milk .
 ya sorry chiu are right
 why so many f&b shops with such names ?
 theres a toast shop called feng sheng hao ,  guess how long they will last ?
 typical lifespan of a bubble tea outlet .
 the brand will still be around but outlets are always come and go ,  especially when their leasing contract expires .
 the name originated from main shop in tw ?
 i went taiwan outlet ,  it had the longest queue among other bubble tea outlets at xmy~ .
 then they brought in to singapore ,  the decor like low ses similar to hdb neighborhood type~   .
 so today my papa ask me go the srv excursion with him ,  got excursion bas come pick us up .
 last night i drank a few can of beer ,  and ended up knock out ,  supposed to wake up at 8am ,  ended up kena shook awake by papa say is 845am liao ,  and the bas will be here at 9am .
 so without much time to prepare ,  i lim the hot coffee ,  slurp down the bowl of mee siam my papa bought and change ,  then go downstairs with papa ,  heng ah the bas we managed to catch .
 on the bus ,  my papa sit with his friends while i find a corner at the back of the bas but all seats taken ,  so bo bian i went to front of the bas and settle down ,  the bas start going on the expressway and it was at this point of time ,  my stomach started growling ,  must be the coffee and mee siam .
 heng ,  it felt like farts instead of laosai ,  looking around and seeing everyone was chatting happily ,  and ths bus driver blast the music damn loud ,  so i thought i fart no one should know .
 feeling upbeat ,  i decided to let my farts out according to the beats of the music ,  and i enjoyed the farts .
 please vote for ah gui to be edmwer of the year 2021 .
 throughout ,  the bus driver keep looking at me ,  i was thinking he couldnt have heard me ,  maybe he find me quite yandao .
 suddenly ,  my papa came up and hit my head ,  i wonder what happened and took out my earpiece ,  then i realised the whole bas was quiet ,  the music was actually coming from my earpiece .
 filled with embarassment ,  my sai rushed to the exit and all out onto the seat .
 i had to sit on my pile of sai until we reached the destination ,  i ran down the bus and ran all the way home .
 i am crying as i typing this .
 with this ,  i wont vote for ts  .
 ah gui try my best liao
 i never read oso .
 i see pang sai i cheesed off liao .

 singapore one is paying the jhk for franchise .

 well i love to see variety of f&b to be available in singapore .
 imagine we oni have 1 liho wont that be boring .
 this kind of drinks very expensive and  oni make people fat .
 good to close more of these nonsense .
 xft actually oso got brewed tea ,  sugar level is up to customer to choose .
 can choose no sugar .
 drink more will get diabetes .
 close down better
 chiu sure he release from jail ,  lta engage him and offer him a higher remuneration ?
 hmm lta must be register with yellow ribbon and a good employer then 
 dumb arse deserve longer jail for being stupid
 can seek refugee and work in thailand ,  indonesia ,  dubai ,  malaysia ,  philpines  
 or is it he steal 2 laptop , jail few month oni so no record ?
 whoops sorry it’s 11 stabs .
 just google ‘11 stabs edmw‘ can have all the post
 but tia gong from edwmer ,  nowaday those not serious crime or so call petty theft is have no record after release ?
 he is not wise .
 this kind of small time crime oni nets him about $30 , 000 .
 the audit trial is easy to track and there are serial numbers to all the computer units he stole and resold .
 even selling on carousell is all recorded .
 being arrested is inevitable .
 the crime is undeniable .
 no way to argue .
 he deserves jail for being stupid .
 the clever criminals con others ,  in grey areas where chiu cannot exactly say they committed any crime .
 robbing bank like david roach oni nets chiu small money .
 when chiu con others like sunshine empire or unit trust managers ,  the amount chiu can swindle is incredible .
 james phang wa used sunshine empire to con 20 , 000 sinkies out of nearly $190 million .
 oni $21 million was ever recovered .
 that leave $169 million unaccounted for .
 he got 9 years jail in 2010 but got out earlier maybe due to good behaviour in 2017 .
 now he can enjoy that $169 million .
 that is the way to do it - not rob a bank or steal computers to sell - if chiu want to commit crime .
 unit trust managers even better .
 stock market went up ,  then they say they are brilliant and take money from chiu .
  stock market crash and chiu lost everything ,  they say too bad that is the inherent risk .
 they take money from chiu and play with your money in stocks .
 i amaze , somemore lta side give him higher salary ,  he smile .
 if in this world everyone is same smart ,  there is no worker le , all is boss le
 dont even need this .
 that time got pic bonus .
 so many people set up shop ,  do it contracting .
 then charge sky high prices tell them gahment pay no worries 
 oh that lady who kill his husband .
 ya this one even more amazing ,  unless u tell me murder got no record on her , how did she get another job ?
 he desperate le as maybe ahlong threaten him le
 demonstrates decisiveness and ability to get things done   .
 chiu work in lta ?
 lta the person incharge of it procurement alway the same chinese guy though recently there is like a ah bang assisting
 even more amazing is ,  her new workplace ,  the people there feel ok to work with a murderer ?
 he told me le ,  last time i work school om
 court documents say he had physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her and their daughter ,  as their marriage had broken down  .
 i mean as long as chiu dont get into a relationship with her .
 iast time i work school om , last time these it engineer mostly pinoy ,  few singapore and msian , oni recently they hire singapore and msian as lesser pinoy work it engineer le
 didnt she get a new husband oredi ?
 moi remember last time moi corlick steal many laptops  .
 our celery last time 1200 .
 how to survive ?
 end up tio caught go jail .
 eh the glue not strong anymore ah .
 is glued under the edmw must reads
 i do like to ask what is the singapore bike forum ?
 is it refer to sammy boy ?
 i dont want to say ,  u know it urself .
 i really dunno cna please pm me the answer if it not good to be post here thanks , 
 bumps to keep thread alive~
 is this an idea for more lingo ?
 ah ah ah ah~ staying alive ,  staying alive~~~
 can chiu add the lingo  &apos;tia gong &apos; ?
 can add mampos ?
 wapiang ,  still alive ar this thread ?
 but then this place is a must visit for all newbees & noobs hor .
 kym means what ar ?
 pruss one to keep this thread alive and from being pruned by system 
 should just make it sticky 
 u prefer the hand made lumpy type ?
  or the machine flattened type ?
 and with a even higher density ,  the next pandemic might just wipe us out ?
 will we be betta off as a global medical hub radder than fcuknancial hub  .
 more like do they know our economy growth model is unsustainable in long run
 it is the people who dont recognise that it is sustainable as long as there is a blank check .
 i think they will be more than happy with that scenario .
 cos they want cash out max and leave all the feces to young gen .
 chiu will be glad to know that they are begining to realize about the icu beds
 if chiu are being evaluated for 5 years &apos; performance kpi .
 why think long term ?
 hong kong has a higher population density and didnt they control the pandemic nicely ?
 hong kong probably less dense now though ?
 thought they all flowing out to angmo countries post 2019 .
 what is not sustainable ?
 for covid now is testing how many case per day health care system can tank .
 once we know this number .
 the population can be 7mil 10 or 15mil as long as there are measures to limit hitting this number will not be an issue .
 there is no single known case at ivory tower ,  why should they care
 everything is notch hok !
 look at the entry points of public transport  .
 look at the shrunken housing and how packed it has become .
 look at the public healthcare system .
 look at the communal spaces  .
 look at how many cb ha we have .
 how is that hok if population increase another 20% from current level ?
 the open leg policy is there for a reason
 chiu know everyone have finite life spend ?
 once u r dead ,  no problem liao .
 if their pay is depending on not understand this ,  they will pretend not understand indefinitely .
 thats why the opposition proposal of tying minister pay with median salary is a good one .
 tying with gdp ,  all sort of talents imports are important .
 even if he knows .
 he still carry on then how .
 not like we can do anything
 maybe need more scholars to write papers to justify why not sustainable
 no need worry ,  can import more to replace the gone ones .
 sure can once singapore is operating at 24x7 in 4 shifts .
 meaning the people will come out in non overlapping batches of 4 .
 sad to say as a joke something like this happened to mi before .
  was at my ex gf hse ,  lunch dinner never eat ,  drank from late afternoon .

 i just came back from polyclinic to get medicine for my plantar fasciitis .
 kena a ceca doctor today  .
 when i knock the door n open the door to go in ,  he never say a word of hello or come in and continue typing his pc so i thought he was very busy focusing on typing reports .
 so i never say a word and just sit down n wait for him to finish his task  .
 in the end u know what happen ?
 his first word to me is .
  &apos;are u going to sit there n not speak a word or even say hi ?
 or are u waiting for me to initiate the convo ?
 u not even going to say hi doctor ?
 i hear him say that i jitao sibei hot and say to him ,  i am been polite n considerate to keep quiet and let u finish your task first before u engage to my diagnosis and i iam dealing with high amount of pain from my arch area the moment i start walking n apply pressure on my arch ,  i am fighting the pain in my mind and spirit right now even by speaking to chiu ,  what do u expect ?
 smile and say hi doctor sweetly ?
 and he reply me  &apos;i am oso in pain in my throat from talking since morning till now !

 but the actors not the young guniang oppa  type ,  so should be watchable .
 tiagong reviews not so good .
 but will try first episode see how
 too much suspense…boring to watch… .
 hope to have zero-g piak scene 
 decent enough but not as good as i expected .
 so far 3 episode liao not too bad
 if you &apos;re watching this for the science ,  dont bother .
 moon &apos;s gravity is similar to earth .
 slow grind but otherwise watchable .
 lots of merlions
 feels slow but ok
 originally thought it was space zombies ,  turn out to be water babies .
 slow burn show that gradually picks up its pace .
 not the typical k-drama show .
 more like a b+ us series series .
 it started out with being very unpredictable (e .
 g very hard to guess the intent of one &apos;s action / scene) to becoming very predictable in the end .
 for the casuals ,  one would hope for more action scenes .
 for the entusiasts ,  one would hope for a deeper thought process .
 neither here neither there kind of show .
 moi final rating: 7/10 saved by good acting .
 total waste of time for moi .
 watchable but not spectacular
 at least the script writer wrote something special .
 moonwalk was bad .

 apple inc is angling to participate in a new scheme to boost india &apos;s exports of computer products ,  part of what gahment and industry sources say are plans to bring ipad tablet manufacturing to the south asian country .
 india launched a $6 .
 7 billion plan to boost smartphone exports last year ,  as prime minister narendra modi stepped up efforts to promote electronics manufacturing and create jobs .
 apple ,  which has steadily raised production of iphones in india to lessen its dependence on chinese manufacturing ,  took part in that scheme via its contract manufacturers .
 now the gahment is preparing to unveil another incentive to drive local manufacturing of it products including tablets ,  laptops and servers ,  three sources closely involved in the drafting of the plan told reuters .
 hsk say want to up manufacturing but the info got reach apple or not .
 standy for incredible apple .
 beijing (reuters) - cheena ,  under growing global pressure over its treatment of a muslim minority in its far west ,  is mounting an unprecedented and aggressive campaign to push back ,  including explicit attacks on women who have made claims of abuse .
 as allegations of human rights violations in xinjiangmount ,  with a growing number of western lawmakers accusing cheena of genocide ,  beijing is focusing on discrediting the female uighur witnesses behind recent reports of abuse .
 chinese officials have named women ,  disclosed what they say is private medical data and information on the women &apos;s fertility ,  and accused some of having affairs and one of having a sexually transmitted disease .
 the officials said the information was evidence of bad character ,  invalidating the women &apos;s accounts of abuse in xinjiang .
  &apos;to rebuke some media &apos;s disgusting acts ,  we have taken a series of measures ,  &apos; xu guixiang ,  the deputy head of xinjiang &apos;s publicity department ,  told a december news conference that was part of china &apos;s pushback campaign .
 it includes hours-long briefings ,  with footage of xinjiang residents and family members reading monologues .
 a reuters review of dozens of hours of presentations from recent months and hundreds of pages of literature ,  as well as interviews with experts ,  shows a meticulous and wide-reaching campaign that hints at china &apos;s fears that it is losing control of the xinjiang narrative .
  &apos;one reason that the communist party is so concerned about these testimonies from women is cos it undermines their initial premise for what they &apos;re doing there ,  which is anti-terrorism &apos; ,  said prof james millward ,  a professor of chinese history at georgetown university and expert in xinjiang policy .
  &apos;the fact that there are so many women in the camps .
 who dont have the faintest appearance of being violent people ,  this just shows how this has nothing to do with terrorism .
 uighurs make up most of the one million people who a united nations estimate says have been detained in xinjiang camps under what the central gahment calls a campaign against terrorism .
 accusations by activists and some western politicians include torture ,  forced labour and sterilisations .
 in rare us bipartisan agreement ,  the top diplomats of the former administration of donald trump and the new one of joe biden have called china &apos;s treatment of the uighurs genocide ,  a stance adopted last week by the canadian and dutch parliaments .
 cheena faces sanctions such as a ban on us purchases of xinjiang cotton and tomatoes ,  and calls by some western lawmakers to boycott the 2022 beijing winter olympics .
 the ministry of foreign affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on monday .
 the gahment denies accusations of abuse at the  &apos;vocational training centres &apos; in the remote western region ,  and says claims of systematic sexual abuse are unfounded .
 beijing has rejected calls for an independent un investigation into xinjiang &apos;s internment programme .
 journalists and diplomats have not been permitted access to the camps outside of tightly controlled gahment tours .
 uighurs in xinjiang have told reuters they fear reprisals for speaking to press while in cheena .
 china &apos;s tightly controlled ,  invitation-only media events on xinjiang require journalists to submit questions days or weeks in advance .
 they include pre-recorded videos and prepared testimony by former camp inmates and religious figures .
 beijing has packaged content from the events in two volumes titled ,   &apos;the truth about xinjiang: exposing the us-led lies and slanders about xinjiang &apos; .
 in january ,  the twitter account of china &apos;s us embassy was suspended for a tweet that said uighur women had been  &apos;baby-making machines &apos; before beijing instituted its system of camps .
  &apos;the biological ,  the reproductive ,  the gendered aspect of this is particularly horrifying to the world ,  &apos; said georgetown &apos;s prof millward .
 cheena  &apos;seems to have recognised that .
 chiu now see them trying in this clumsy way to respond .
 during a regular daily press briefing last week ,  foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin held up images of witnesses who had described sexual abuse in xinjiang .
 the account of one of them ,  he said ,  was  &apos;lies and rumours &apos; cos she had not recounted the experience in previous interviews .
 he gave medical details about the woman &apos;s fertility .
 xinjiang officials in january said a woman who had spoken to foreign media had syphilis ,  and they showed images of medical records - unsolicited information that was not directly related to her account .
 a xinjiang gahment official said of another witness last month:  &apos;everyone knows about her inferior character .
 she &apos;s lazy and likes comfort ,  her private life is chaotic ,  her neighbours say that she committed adultery while in cheena .
 last week ,  the top spokesman for china &apos;s foreign ministry ,  ms hua chunying ,  tweeted images of four named witnesses ,  saying they had  &apos;raked their brains for lies &apos; ,  adding  &apos;they will never succeed &apos; .
 cheena has declined to provide data on the number of people in the camps .
 beijing initially denied the camps existed but now says they are vocational and education centres and that all the people have  &apos;graduated &apos; .
 is poor thing .
 in cheena bashing thread .
 reuters together with bbc is fabricating lies
 if chiu have nothing to hide why need to vet questions and need a few weeks to come out with an answer ?
 why not allow everyone in the world to visit xinjiang freely ,  just like beijing ?
 the more u tried to defend ,  the more stupid u look .
 xinjiang cannot go freely meh ?
 thought got edmwer been there before say is a beautiful place ?
 liddat cheena really need a new pr team .
 chao ccp tiongs are very insecure .
 in before edmwers say the prettiest tiong actresses they fap to are uighur women  !
 lol no wonder so many xinjiang traditional costume ladies dancing videos on youtube short videos lately
 the expert did not research the profile of those that shouted snackbar before chibaboom ?
 when i said freely means go there ,  walk ard and do what a normal tourist would normally do .
 try putting on a gopro cam on your body and bring out your canon/nikon 70-200mm lens and walk around .
 this is what i meant .
 i support independence tw and free hkg but not a separatist east turkestan islamic movement .
 those murderer are the one the bombed bkk four face buddha which killed many innocent
 not surprised ,  ccp current sop is to evade the accusations and smear/discredit anyone who speak out against them .
 say their character no good ,  personal lifestyle chaotic ,  got messy relationships with the opposite sex ,  etc etc .
 why do u think tw and hong kong want to get away in the 1st place ?
 if tiongs cant even convince people of the same ethnicity and culture to stick with them ,  how far u think they can convince people of diff ethnicity and culture ?
 ccpland has standup .
 why can’t people do that ?
 this is xinjiang not north korea chiu dumbnut
 not referring to local spg ?
 if u dunno please shutup .
 ignore those ibs la .
 thats what chinese saying ,  eyes opened but talk blindly .

 the message is very clear ,  sharp and in focus .
 very well articulated .
 sinkies dont like csj and his style of aggressive opposition politics .
 sinkies prefer the mild fake opposition .
 well then let it be .
 im happy with status quo anyway and many sinkies lives like mine actually dont depend on pap doing the right things .
 so if sinkies want mild fake opposition ,  then fine .
 im happy to go along .
 got dabian still got people hide .
 better take out & clean else may implode if cover up for too long .
 jbj did ruffle many feathers so sinkies can know what is really happening .
 yes ,  many people want such character in parliament ,  but lt does not even know the right strategy to win vote in election how chiu expect he get a chance to march into the parliament ?
 his campaign strategy oni focus on small bunch of his blind follower and not on the mass voters so chiu think he can win ?
 then the next question come ,  he should be smart enough to know his style will never get enough vote to smell the parliament ,  so he is fighting for his personal agenda oni !
 he indeed needs campaign manager & strategists .
 but then if no big sponsor ,  how to have enough money to recruit strategists ?
 other countries allow to recruit foreigners as strategists .
 hopefully he can get sponsor from lhy & lwl after trying to let the public know the truth behind ah gong &apos;s last wish .
 what else do chiu expect from these vindictive oppies ?
 all got axe to grind with pap .
 lock them all up under isd save the trouble
 should just combine ,  then divide and conquer
 quite respect for doing this ,  and actually uncovering some insights into the case .
 testifying or not in court for what they have been posting in facebook about their brother ,  has nothing to do with whether they like lim tean and his style of politics .
 chiu are simply testifying for what chiu wrote .
 the fact they chose not to testify ,  i could oni conclude their facebook posts were nothing short of utter rubbish or exaggerated stuff .
  another keyboard warrior not much different from us .
 otherwise why wouldnt chiu go court to show the world chiu standby what chiu wrote  ?
 chiu blind or pretend not to acknowledge the fact that the late pm lky was misleaded to believe that the oxley house was gazette by the relevant authorities which kkl unable to confirm despite attempted twice to establish it .
 that was a different era under strongman lky with total media blackout ?
 i doubt the same can be done in this era .
  but the wp mps more interested in niaming about peripheral issues or wayanging .
 see liao damn sian .
 i still irritated that they have not made an issue about the increase in the medisheld premiums .
 instead whole day niam about min wage without being clear about the model we should follow .
 hope more sgeans rally behind lim .
 very few lawyers have the balls of steel to do what he did .
 i feel he was excluded for the televised debate to prevent him from biaoyan .
 i think in oppo camp ,  the best debater is him .
 that said ,  they should get a female to soften their image .
 look like angry debt collectors .
 next yr ndp give chiu 2 free tickets for your contribution and support .
 virtual ticket sibo .
 its likely we still under cb by then .
 which gahment allow traveling freely now ?
 they can go back if they want but coming back is uncertain .
 chiu know what most want boh ?
 they want to go back & forth without paying the  &apos;pricey &apos; swab test  .
 where got best of both worlds one hor ?
 chiu gotta respect the country and the culture .
 ai dua liap nee .
 ask them go back kampong and work lor ?
 then what they wan to do~~~~~~~
 u trying to stir ?
 they can go back but the problem is that they might not go back to their home town leh .
 think many states red right ?
 they can always go back n perhaps oso consider dont ever come back .
 got ask for apology ?
 not happy fug back la ownself scared cannot come back only
 the oni reason why they come here to work is that they see benefit for themselves alone .
 so proud to be malaysian ,  with a ****ed up gahmen ,  then go back lor .
 leech off singapore oni .
 ownself greedy and gian 3:1 until can abandon family for it still wanna blame others .
 pap rly mollycoddle all these ft scum until they think singapore owes them a living
 these malaysians always want to have the best of everything ,  but at other people &apos;s expense ,  they are a bunch of selfish ,  self-centre and cunning idiots
 trapped jhk dulan ,  jin song
 lmao not clicking
 put tank in a mall comes from tagalog (putang ina mo) ,  which means fark your mom ,  or your mom &apos;s a whore .
 first use was spotted in xda forums when a forum mod banned a user for using putang ina mo ,  which he returned with another account and used put tank in a mall instead .
 1) he &apos;s such a buaya (he &apos;s such a lecher) .
 2) he is buaya-ing her (he &apos;s trying to hit on her)
 61% welcome him  .
 never click but if got any other reason than 3:1 means he lying .

 this wan is due to spreading .
 others r their own conditions right ?
 cos covid dua kee mah .
 totally no logic
 in 2020 we have the highest numbervof sinkies committing suicides
 then why worry about businesses are closing down and people become jobless during the pandemic .
 before covid oso got many businesses up lorry and many people cannot find jobs ,  why no people concern ?
 unemployment of 10% is no joke .
 economy collapse is no joke .

 she looked jin song oso .
 never fapped to her .
 chiu are really dumb ,  she consented to sex and oso consented to being filmed .
 now chiu want to point fingers at him for what reason ?
 why not u blame his parents for giving him such good genes that women find him irresistible ?
 first pic reminds me of lin qing xia .

 there is no evidence to suggest that ghost does not exist .

 we seriously need people like this in parliament to stir up vigorous debate
 lt is going for ah dou and the party .
 the siblings are not likely to help destroy the family business .
 in these days od crowd funding ,  the old ways of bankrupting your opponents through libel don’t seem to work anymore
 where did this come from ?
 chiu really know how to stir .
 at least 10 20 years liao
 hard to find a lawyer with guts like lim tean nowadays ,  unfearful of kena blacklisted or fixed by his fellow  &apos;law &apos; society peeps and gahment .
 whether right or wrong ,  we need more lawyers like him instead of those money grabbing yes men
 props to him actually .
 he did what he said he dared to do .
 will ravi support lim teah on his research ?
 what new things did we learn from the trials ?
 playing with ppl &apos;s lives ?
 lock up people without trial ?
 what if it happens to your friends & family lick up without trial ?
 who is vindictive here ?
 that kkl is fking scared of testifying .
 some history learnt today .
 has it got to do with singapore ?
 lim team ,  csj ,  jbj style are the minimum expected standard of opposition in western countries .
 mild timid people like current wp ones will not cut it in places like britain and us .
 chiu see how aggressively they attacked the british pm in parliament and even jeering him .
 and no it &apos;s nothing to do with numbers .
 jbj didnt have numbers yet he alone did it .
 in fact back then ,  jbj &apos;s wp is way smaller than today and less oiled .
 so dont tell me  &apos;oh oni 10 oppo mp ,  what chiu expect them to do &apos; .
 let moi guess ,  in the end still gonna lose
 for their hardwork we are in phase 3 .
 this year they really proved themselves .
 **** them understand .
 if not for oyk dont do unto others by not banning cheena early ,  the whole world not will be in this mess

 sinkieland jin cruel mens force jhk to stay in singapore .
 they choose money over family leh ,  not our gahmen or sinkies fault leh
 gian the power of 1:3 ,  just say so .
 not happy can go home
 covid has shown that msians can never separate $$$ from family .
 if they choose the $$$ here then have to forgo the family part .
 they can go back just that have to quarantine on both sides n they have to pay .
 power of 1:3 stronger than any family ties
 these pinoys eat too full nothing to do ?
 they are supposed to work till their last breathe .
 still wan to conquer singapore .
 u just remember cny n most importantly is chiu r happy !
 jiu hu sai bunch of whining village people .

 whether u r teens ,  adult  ,  elderly ,  u r still a human  .
 and whosehs i never go to gp  ?
 i say this again i need referral letter .
 otherwise u think i so free go there  queue up ?
 dont be a smart alec and act like u oredi know everything behind someone background .
 if u start seeing doctor since 13 years old till 35 ,  i am sure a 100 doctor count of visit is nothing esp during ns .
 u kiang can oredi ,  dont gey kiang
 will chiu be keeping us updated on your complain ?
 any brand to recommned ?
 i just wrote over .
 if got reply then i will update here
 they are the princes of singapore .
 they know now singapore in need of health care  workers and gahment will beg on their knees and prostrate themselve begging them not to resign and return to india .
 its ok la ,  i will go private then .
 but if i can use subsidies then why not ?
 oredi pay tax pay until so much liao ,  might as well make use of it .
 scally one day gahment say pink ic no longer have 1st class benefit
 this doc has no eq and is rude .
 he should be the one to welcome u and be the first to say hi cos he is there to serve u .
 please write in and complain to the head so that they can teach their staff the proper way to behave to the public .
 sound like csb leh .
 ceca can come with fake cert be doctor anytime .
 if this story is true and the doc is not a local ,  please complain to moh ,  singhealth about this kind of farkers .
 ceca bring their caste system over here ,  maybe he belong to the brahmin caste and he thought chiu are a dalit .
 so he expects chiu to greet him before he diagnose chiu .
 he never ask chiu to bow and kiss his feet oredi very good liao .
 thats the issue with bringing in fts from a certain nationality wholesale .
 they expect us to conform to them instead of assimilating when there is so many of them here .
 complain to moh ?
 now singapore in short supply of health care workers .
 date to guailan ?
 jitao komplain rah
 160 says it roles labor shortage leh
 chiu oredi say 160 .
 160 things can believe .
 pig can climb tree .
 a few days ago  ,  got people claim it can earn until banker oso want to jump ship .
 now got it staff steal and sell notebooks which is not even much  .
 now i am even more confused who is saying the truth about it pay .
 25 yo is it engineer oredi .
 sinkie male 25 yo just graduated from university oni .
 it role is very wide ,  chiu can be a it support to a domain specialist .
 ncs high chance is jhk
 it  &apos;engineer &apos; in this case usually refers to it support right ?
 it engineer or desktop support ,  minimum 2k .
 if work as technology executive with bank minimum 3-4k
 i think all my old ncs folks had left the coy by now .
 tech exec in back and swe got what difference ?
 alamak ,  missed buying cheap cheap top quality laptops .
 anyone knows if moh will recover the laptops ?
 tech exec is boa kah liao support ,  infra and it admin   ,  swe oni focused on systems development at most dev ops .
 tech exec will have higher chance of after office hrs activation as they are mostly first line to be activated for any service outage and will then escalate .
 depend on coy ,  outsource companies/vendors like ncs .
 their pay is confirm low ,  i been to recruitment drive for ta position under ncs 10 years back .
 chiu be surprised how much they offer that many left and i wasn &apos;t interested .
 so those whoseh earn big bucks maybe directly under company .
 the oni way to retrieve the laptops is to access the seller &apos;s account and back trace all the buyers .
 if the buyers are foreigners will be even harder to trace .
 oso ,  he damn lucky to not be slapped with violating the official secrets act .
 actually is kinda .
 come private is vary ,  some is very good in checking etc .
 whereas come public sectors/ stat boards is  all under one roof .
 slack ,  lack ,  there chiu go .
 this is why ago always every single year can find flaws .
 that’s why there need to be a realistic picture of it jobs .
 the claim of “it staff shortage” has distorted the reality of it jobs .
 enticing mass entry into careers with distorted view will creates social problems  .
 depends what u wotking as ,  most people those field engineer or it support ,  much less than median .
 so u want believe me or those people up to u
 got do stock take le
 i oso don’t know who to believe … they claim it pay is so good until lawyer ,  doctor ,  banker all want to jump ship to it  .
 inbefore mata cospray pix
 she looked so good in that .
 i want to marry her .
 how come she didnt ages ?

 3rd thread i saw on this

 why does one person need so much money .
 this world is just crazy
 any dorm wannabe inside bo ?
 they dont intend to be that rich from beginning
 sinkieland got that accumulated amount of money or not ?
 win your seat then say la .
 if can dont go testify ,  why go ?
 they r not ordinary sinkies that after a while public forget the face .
 tats why it &apos;s detrimental for pm to go court to testify .
 so ,  many politicians dont want sue in case closets stuff all come out .
 unless u intentionally want to expose then that is different .
 share the same fate .
 before a nation falls ,  there are signs .
 chiu said it yourself in western countries  .
 we are asian society  .
 those western ideology dont work for us  .
 if it works those jokers would have gotten elected
 thats cos sinkies r generally passive aggressive in nature
 brace for crisis .
 lol it is lhl who is the one who wants to stir dabian n started all his nonsense
 love it when there is criticism of wp .
  wp ibs will tio stir like spray insecticide into a cockroach nest .
 usually ,  start by calling names such as dogs etc .
 cannot criticise wp ah ?
 oni ask for this report and ask for that report ah .
 the medishield premium still increasing right ?
 thought someone say very loud on national tv say wanna stop blank cheque ?
 this is the biggest blank cheque of a generation which has the effect of draining the medisave of all sinkies even if chiu dont fall sick and use medisave for 20 years .
 ask your masters to grow some balls and demand the increase be stopped la .
 think chiu have stirred the wp ibs to come out from nesting .
 wp cannot be criticised ok .
 and if they lose the argument .
 and yes ,  they will just resort to oni 10 mp nia ,  what chiu expect them to do .
 form the gahment then say la .
 1 lim tean is doing more than 10 wp mp .
 didnt know taiwan in the west .
 how about let &apos;s get to 33% & we can all comment effective or not ?
 & u know for sure 10 really cant stop policy detrimental to sinkies or country .
 u talk what cock ?
 they did not testify in court simply cos they were not subpoenaed .
 just like for kwa kim li ,  they would have to testify if they were subpoenaed by either plaintiff or defence .
 everybody entitled to their own views .
 i dont expect everybody to agree with me .
 we can agree to disagree
 dont dare to contest more seats .
 withdraw from jalan besar ,  nee soon and macpherson etc .
 jin satki mens .
 wans to suck 3x the pay but oso wans to help msia gahment to transmit covid
 they work as finance managers earning 1:3 ,  unhappy for what ?
 hahah singapore employers love this  &apos;hunger &apos; from the ft who sacrifice family time for sgd .
 sinkies will never be this hungry  .
 not sure fortunate or unfortunate  .
 money or familee .
 for many ,  the choice is clear .
 agree with pieface .
 it seems those not happy ones are the ones want their cake and eat it too .
 with the situation ,  chiu can oni choose one .
 actually if free quarantine they are ok with it .
 but now have to pay both ways and 24 days of quarantine  .
 no one is stopping them from balek kampong .
 eh don’t stir la they aren’t unhappy with the gahment they are unhappy with covid .
 if unhappy with gahment oso will be with msian gahment whose incompetency scuppered any chance of relaxed quarantine rather than singapore one .
 come come come .
 join our sinki family and take our passport .
 our job can give to them .
 they can then happily stay here happy new year
 best way to describe them .
 that’s why sinkieland is 1:3 .
 can anyone imagine when happens gahment announce date of causeway opening ?
 what would the queue be like ?
 thousands camping at woodlands days before opening .
 gahment need to cap daily limit by booking online .
 just endure chiu in here and make money is ok
 not happy just f back lor  !
 they are rich enough to rent a yacht .
 usually i will do wats annoying to these self professed elites .
 ignore them ,  treat them like low class .
 the fact that ts kept quiet sitting there triggered this stuck up guy &apos;s ego .
 he expected to be greeted 1st and sat there waiting for it
 u want this kind of doc to take care of u if u r in icu ?
 report for racist thread !
 arch support normally is best customise for good and comfort fitting but since chiu need it in a hurry to ease the pain ,  best is buy off the shelves ,  from sport shop or pharmacy .
 i using the brand sole and scholl off shelves since alot more cheaper than customise (about 400 a set but sometimes will have fitting issue too ,  need to modify by the podiatrist) and i can live with a little miss fit .
 i saw there is a specialist shop at ntf hospital and velocity selling shoe for such conditions ,  probably chiu can visit them for advise for insole which they likely to sell .
 there are many brands online but unfortunately chiu cant have a feel .
 once arch is pop up ,  the pain will be mostly  relief but the fitting may not be comfortable especially for 1st timer .
 last time at polyclinic i got greet good morning ,  then cbk ginna doc replied impatiently give me a minute ,  he was texting  .
 need his referral to see specialist ,  but after that go gp for referral .
 ts should tell off that mofo ,  where &apos;s his bedside manners ,  he thinks this is slumpland
 i suspect at most lipservice tell will reply ts that they advised or at most counsel the doctor liao .
 and i think will be some meek hr officer stuttering to his/her ceca master .
 giving generic advice and assuring him that it is just an advisory nia .
 nothing to worry about .
 all are in the records .
 dont fear their egos .
 feed the trolls ,  & you &apos;ll create monsters
 just tell him where is your batch ?
 fug off chiu fuging snake .
 their attitude has always been on a high horse looking down at their patients and not realising that 90% of the time they are peddling drugs that treat oni symptoms ,  such as panadol ,  statin ,  metformin  .
 ts why u never kneel down and beg for forgiveness ?
 last time tekong medical ctr got one bbfa mo sibei guailan one .
 like to tekan chao recurit .
 dunno why so fat still can become doctor .
 ts your fault la .
 how can chiu expect brahmin doctors to greet sinkie dalits first ?
 ts count yourself lucky he never lape chiu ,  try google indian doctor xxxx ,  not joking .
 i see alot of bbfa doc nowadays ,  getting more .
 how old are chiu .
  late 90s  oredi got computer liao .
 windows 95 system
 they are pap &apos;s pride ,  so just suck it up .
 if not happy can always leave cuntry and make way for more of them to cum here .
 i was at a&e n under observation before being warded .
 i saw a cxcx doc went to a patient cubicle n closed the curtain ,  there &apos;s a gap n i saw him sitting near the sleeping patient n texting .
 then another doc called out if he &apos;s free ,  he replied he &apos;s attending to patient .
 he was in there for some time playing with hp .
 when i was ns ,  its 2005 ,  polyclinic doctor use paper file to record de .
 thats why if u kena this polyclinic doctor very strict ,  dont wan give u mc ,  u can actually just walk off after consultation and go to another polyclinic and see doctor since the record from different polyclinic cannot be track  .
 nowadays cannot liao ,  cause all records is under the central server ,  any doctor in any polyclnic oso can access your file from their pc
 sorry man this isnt the army .
 i go clinic must greet doctor ?
 i go private specialist the doctor stand up shake my hand call me sir .
 there &apos;s oni two path ,  zero policy or living with covid .
 mtf indecisive ,  no planning ,  waiting for things to happen approach result in we in mo man land .
 right blame mtf for reverting ,  left blame mtf for opening .
 why we need an indecivise mutiple million $$ team ?
 we predicted al month ago mtf will have to go back to tightening as healthcare cannot handle .
 we are correct .
 moving foward ,  situation will oni get worse .
 the tightening too late too little ,  wont bring the cases down ,  it will continue to shoot up .
 i predict more tightening in coming weeks ,  including no dine in at hawkers
 yes i hope more tighenting in the coming weeks .
 can’t wait for cb .
 dont close now ,  come xmas all the people come out again
 is endemic liao
 this is the classic case of too many cooks spoils the soup .
 at this rate ,  very soon we will have some 3rd gen minister coming in to  &apos;advice &apos; mtf .
 if they pushing for endemic ,  then make sure our hospital infrastructure can support it… .
 dont this mutha farkers have any foresight at all even though they have so many experts surrounding them .
 if chiu all correct ,  it means more retrenchment ahead .
  it is no joke and no fun .
 as a professional taxi driver ,  i suffer alot from this disruptive covid .
 one cock leader wearing red underwear outside want to chiong .
 experts want to por lanpa .
 moh squeeze in the middle ,  hospitals work like fuuk .
 if workable then i arm chio .
 remove oyk = problem solved .
 he the one trying so hard to score points be pm ,  then screw up everything
 mmtf was given a task that was impossible .
 it is unfair to the mmtf .
 maybe some powerful person must have laid down the rule that no matter what ,  plane loads of indians from india will be allowed to fly into singapore .
 delta variant comes from where ?
 it is like asking a doctor to cure a patient from snake poison ,  when new snake poisons are constantly being injected into his body .
 how can it be done .
 lock down in this case is merely a temporary pause .
 the underlying cause has not been removed .
 this is not racism .
 it is common sense .
 if india has an out-of-control delta variant infection landscape ,  it is plain stupidity to allow plane loads of them to enter singapore .
 in the beginning ,  their push for diabetes epidemic has been more subtle ,  eventually obesity and prediabetes have become so common in the us and they were told that there is no cure for diabetes except for a life time of medications which cause the health conditions to deteriorate as we now know .
 but the push for this endemic and asking for everyone to be infected etc is defintely harsh .
 can endemic la .
 that why they call sinkies dont keep calling moh if infected mah .
 no call mean everything good mah .
 lack of foresight ,  hindsight .
 what they &apos;ve are backsides !
 covids moving northward everyday ,   .
 deaths increasing steadily .
 but not unexpected  .
 singapore too small and dense for endemic .
 need to wake up lky liao .
 they want endemic like uk/eu countries but they forgot singapore is very different .
 our high population density will mean steep climb in cases .
 they are sorely unprepared for the sharp increase in hospitalised cases and high number of home recovery persons
 now ,  a panel of 50 bitcoin and cryptocurrency experts has predicted the bitcoin price will continue to climb through 2021 ,  hitting highs of around $80 , 000 ,  before surging to $250 , 000 by 2025 and a staggering $5 million per bitcoin by 2030 .
 liddat everyone will huat le
 most likely news leaked out by existing btc holders .
 buy 100 btc now
 that time ,  people tells chiu 2021 will become $80 , 000 ,  most people will say same thing .
 zhun boh/scam/ponzi and so .
 gonna sell my car ,  hdb ,  condo and wife to help pump the price to usd20m per btc .
 i will buy when it is $5mil/coin .
 ts do remind me again in 2030 please .
 wa ,  going all in nao
 that was different .
 this feels 100% like gamestop .
 bitcoin is lucky that the fed dont ban crypto in the first place .
 in the future where the us feels crypto being too big of a threat then  
 u lost touch with the world ?
 the sec had oredi allowed futures etf to be traded some 2 weeks ago .
 its sooner or later for physical etf
 having an etf doesnt change anything in fact
 tulip mania of this century
 market cap aside ,  the later one is just a 3x ,  the former one is a 80x .
 too many people focus on numbers when the market movers are actually moving  the price in %
 how come singapore covid expert panel kena hoot here ,  but someone say btc expert panel no one blink an eye ?
 no sure thing one .
 btc &apos;s high prices is supported by demand .
 such demand shifts around .
 if one day another mode of digital asset gains more confidence by majority of market participants ,  then the demand will shift to that digital asset .
 somebody please help
 just sold all mine last week .
 all depends on fed .
 if keep on increasing balance sheet to the moon then yeah .
 anything is possible but .
 something &apos;s got to give if we dont want to decent into chaos/anarchy .
 likely western gahment will band together on fiscal policies which will oso restrict/tax crypto  .
 lol now still got people wanna hire ncs ?
 cheap cheap but may encounter criminal working for u siol .
 please la people paid high oso steal .
 the pay is irrelevant .
 what is relevant is how this guy commits criminal offense after thinking it through .
 hope he kena jail the full 7 years and fined full amount of each laptop including the 2 laptops police recovered .
 anyhow misappropriate zheng hu &apos;s monies really should lock up for long time .
 its our money ok .
 who never pay income tax ?
 your income tax kena pwn by this ncs guy leh .
 u happy or not ?
 it role is wide  ,  but job description can put all roles as requirement
 high pay is to prevent corruption .
 it operations or support roles all pay peanuts one la .
 its oni people who are doing system implementation in terms of revamping whole application n system used in companies are earning alot .
 but even then not all of them who are doing so are earning alot .
 they differentiate by who are the ones facing clients and bringing in money vs who the ones putting their heads down and developing scripts .
 pay is relative .
 for fresh grads who are earning 4k+ straightaway ,  chiu tell them 3k is high or low to them ?
 for poly grads or ncs calibre people ,  obviously 4k is godlike to some of them .
 for ncs fresh grads ,  5k is standard to them .
 4k is low to them .
 so it really depends
 must be project manager then can earn alot in it .
 but u must be good in arrowing people to do work and not offending people .
 dunno if he gotch kids or not .
 repair laptop life is jin em0se .
 everyday tio gan by aunties .
 long working hours .
 it job is very glam one .
 wear nice nice and hang around ol  .
 10 years back it technician level of job pay are around $1 .
 4k onwards ,  now i am not sure .
 but for certain low level it role are mostly foreigners .
 21 laptops are quite heavy man .
 he is really v foolish .
 the buyer really tan tio man .
 got a brand new laptop for the price of a second hand laptop .
 its not oni 1 laptop , depend where u r deploy , sometime is repair hundreds of laptop
 moi on average deal with 8 cases a day
 yep basically how they earn .
 can some gahment vendor sexplain how much money did the vendor make by selling stupid lousy machines for about 1 .
 i knew gahment contractors and vendors chop carrot
 ministers take millions dollar salary gong jiao wei oni .
 mayor take money to promote kumgong spirits .
 some tax payer money pour to jobs like sda ,  tray ambassador jobs literally no value to singapore infrastructure .
 some tax money fund ktv supposingly to convert to eatery but end up to pawn all other businesses .
 don’t forget yog and f1 race .
 funds goes to sia oso gone to someone else pockets .
 that amount is nothing compared to what actual waste and loss .
 chiu have pap that endorse alot of generals in sph and smrt  ,  hyflux just to make citizen and shareholders paying for it
 can ,  when i was kid ,  we poor cannot afford water heater ,  just boil water then mix and bath .
 ts no childhood ?
 last weekend is much cooler .
 just tap water without heater is fine .
 in fact very very refreshing under a rain shower !
 if too cold then me need it to be warm .
 but some x would just go for the cold treatment  .
 during active days inside camp got no heater ,  survived 2 .
 5 years no heater .
 my childhood is not a single day without water heater .
 anyway what has water heater to do with childhood ?
 old liao cannot take coldness as well as young
 no heater since yang tyme .
 bbfa ,  so hot liao still use heater .
 cos olden days childhood bo heater .
 needs to boil water ourselves .
 ts is young gen ?
 think about the nsf who have to bathe without water heater .
 tip: apply soap before showering ,  maybe will feel better
 i vaguely remember my 1st heater was a 777 decades ago
 in tekong ,  i bathe cold water everyday
 acty cold showers in the morn &apos; is gd but not advisable to stand under one for too long .
 one advantage is that it &apos;ll jolt u out of your sleepiness  in an instant
 and left sneezing for the rest of the day  
 cold water shower for the past 5 years till now .
 just dont bathe la .
 used to bathe with cold water during active ns days as well as ict .
 during bmt sgt told us to drink more warm water before bath .
 that is why if heater spoilt i will repair it right away .
 these few days not oni need water heater but oso need to close the bathroom window properly .
 cold wind blows into bathroom is sibei no joke .
 legs turn jelly when the cold wind blow to the body when bathing .
 this list needs update

 i bet with chiu wp will be left with hougang next election .
 in not simpur thread
 cant be bothered even if it &apos;s anot simple thread
 who is your dad ?
 your teacher earns much more than him ,  therefore your teacher is right .
 teacher is stupid .
 teacher has more dignity .
 teacher is right cos got backing from principal and moe
 i think chiu got the story wrong .
 chiu got dissociative disorder again .
 it was the school monitor who saw chiu cheating in the exam .
 but he said its your call whether to admit cheating .
 then knn ,  chiu cheat again and the school teacher is furious with the school monitor why never inform the school earlier .
 the class is divided .
 some think the monitor should have baotoh chiu when u first cheated .
 some think the monitor bochap is correct cos nothing to do with him .
 my school monitor crying cos she say she never cheat but teacher oso want to punish her cos as monitor she never prevent me from cheating .
 very simpur thread
 ask yr dad anal the teacher & principal .
 your father can complain teacher why teacher never discover u cheat the first time .
 your parents should have went for vasectomy .
 just a birth control lesson .
 nothing to worry .
 your dad no teach u well .
 should be punished .
 not simpur thread

 ts should have told him if he finds a doctor &apos;s job in singapore giving his throat pain from talking ,  he should consider joining town council bangalah sweeper .
 no need to talk .
 just use hands to sweep .
 got goid n bad la .
 i once finger infections ,  got slight pus .
 served by a female doc ,  prob middle east or  &apos;north south asia &apos; type ,  nt so dark-skinned .
 her eng don have indian slang .
 she was v polite ,  some of her phrases r  &apos;hw r u my dear &apos; ?
 i was a bit shock when she said that .
 i was actually expecting to get medication cream not mc .
 but she still asked if i need .
 i was surprised n asked back  &apos; this seems to b a minor issue .
 can get mc really &apos; ?
 she replied it seems to b a mild to medium issue .
 i was overwhelm by her kind thoughts .
 so i said yes .
 i think i was shocked by her attitude throughout the session .
 she seemed quite pretty in her younger days though 
 he will peddle statin ,  metformin ,  nsaid ,  or even panadol if chiu have a flu and telling chiu that he is oso taking those and at the same time ,  ask chiu to go for your booster .
 chiu can understand what they are saying meh ?
 the ****ing ceca accent so gao .
 i will jitao walk out to file a complaint and ask to see another doctor
 first thing i do is to test whether he is real or fake and to do this ,  it &apos;s very simple ,  just have to check whether he is a pro or anti-vaxxer .
 since he mind pain in the throat by talking to his source of income .
 he should quit his job .
 without patient ,  there won’t be doctor .
 not the right way to check your doctor .
  chiu may be getting someone like fisher or leong without even  realising .
 actually i got a pleasent encounter with a lady ceca doctor at polyclinic last feb .
  she was very detailed in telling me what she is going to prescribe me and told me my previous prescription by hospital was giving me some allegies .
 she further told me what to do if i further encounter the new medications too strong .
 yes ,  chiu should complain .
 not oni docs talk the whole day ,  the reception staff ,  bank/ food order counter staff ,  teachers ,  all have to talk the whole day .
 of course it is the service provider who should initiate the conversation .
 chiu are the one paying afterall ,  even if it is peanuts .
 there should be more empathy especially in healthcare staff .
 when someone sees a doc ,  he must oredi be feeling unwell ,  and to hear such sarcasm from the doc is ridiculous .
 and it is even worse since chiu were actually considerate to let him finish his stuff before attending to chiu .
 chiu should just walk out immediately after hearing that rubbish .
 u look at your entitled kuailan reply and chiu wonder why the doctor will be curt to chiu .
  dont be a karen la .
 still holding on to the grudge kpkb online hours after it happened .
 the doctor probably dont remember u exist .
 actually it ts fault .
 first chiu say hello dr .
 eeeyer why as a doctor he so rude one .
 not as if u scream at him first or what .
 are all ceca attitude liddat one ?
 please lor ,  in rapeland ,  dogs and cats oso can be doctors .
 don’t need to be so arrogant .
 ts should have just replied like this ,  smiled and stepped out of the room .
 come to think of it ,  i &apos;ve never been to a polyclinic in my life !
 local doctors at polyclincs are mostly nice and friendly .
 so far ,  it &apos;s always the doctors say hi to me first cos they need to verify our names .
 which cluster polyclinic chiu go ?
 singhealth or nhg ?
 did chiu take down the name  ?
 before covid ,  i dont visit polyclinic .
 it is during covid that i prefer to go to polyclinic for check up etc cos they separate those who have fever ,  running nose and cough from those who do not have .
 different rooms and different doctors .
 they oso separate the pharmarcy for those who have and do not have symptoms .
 unlike private clinics ,  all mix together .
 first thing i do when i enter doctor’s room is kowtow 3 times
 one house cannot have 2 heads .
 in ancient rome ,  they had 2 consuls as check and balance during peacetime but elected a dictator during a crisis .
 in singapore we do the opposite ,  presumably so everyone can hide behind each other .
 maybe time for us to suggest so they can copy paste ?
 how to impose further restrictions ?
 later our tourism industry chui how ?
 vtl germany and ceca from yeendia need to fly in singapore de .
 err they more gdp oriented .
 dont forget the person who helm the respective minister may not have the relevant experience​

 yah ,  the usual tactic of those pap ib scums .
 they seem to think that by trying to force a choice between wp and the more aggressive politicians like lim tean they can divide the vote .
 but currently there is no need for oppo voters to make a choice between the 2 ,  unless they contest in the same constituency .
 ibs seem to think that they can stir up some quarrel amongst wp and other parties .
 chiu dont talk with cock head la .
 lt met lhy for lunch recently obviously trying to get him appear in court with a nicer approach .
 and it &apos;s obvious lhy didnt want to .
 lt probably dont want to do the hostile way and just leave it as that .
 kwa is different case .
 he will simply subpoena her and done with it .
 he sees no value in being nice with her .
 purely my speculation ?
 by the way chiu are long  enough in edmw to know if chiu throw a personal insult ,  chiu will get one back .
 so yes we can all disagree but no need to get personal
 lt got nothing to lose
 kkl is actually a very critical witness being the lawyer for her client & know what her client &apos;s last wish .
 paid to do her job professionally .
 ofc has to be called to court .
 of course it is possible that lhy and lwl did not want to testify ,  but the fact remains that they were not subpoenaed ,  so u cannot tag the label of  &apos;not willing to testify &apos; unless proven otherwise .
 of course lim tean may have his calculations not to do the subpoena way and damage potential future cooperation with lhy politically .
 my feel is lt wanna do more damage than just lhl alone but the siblings are not willing to wear the hat of bring down what the dad built .
 they probably had some other arrangement .
 look at it this way ,  if it is ah dou sue them for defamation ,  its not them who are trying to pwn family .
 right now its ahdou versus somebody .
 they join in is help outsider pwn ah dou .
 its a perception thing .
 lim tean for president !
 why the 2 siblings dont want to testify ?
 they just dont like lim tean or opposition ?
 anyway i rather we get lim tean in parliament than the sjw raesah khan .
 i said they did not make an issue out of the increase in premiums .
 they oni in parliament ask a few questions consider make an issue ah .
 did they object to the increase ?
 did they say that the increase in premium for 30 year old onward will drain the medisave of sinkees ?
 did the loudmouth jamus lim whoseh wanna stop blank cheque on national tv bring it up on his frivolous social media accounts ?
 one big blank cheque of a generation capable of draining entire generations of their medisave ,  he talk about expensive cake on his fb .
 unless your answer to any of the answers is a yes .
 best chiu diam diam la .
 dont try to prata the my point to suit your argument .
 pinky says he did not want to sue his siblings .
 similarly his siblings must oso appear to not directly attack him too or the sympathy card will be shifted to lhl with his army of chao ibs to shape the narrative that lhl dont want confrontation but his siblings are the evil ones .
 his siblings are not gonna fall into the trap .
 as i mentioned before ,  they did not testify simply cos they were not subpoenaed .
 not cos they were unwilling .
 respect to him .
 not everyone dare to stir the sh .
 bui bui lim for jalan besar  !
 the thing about wp supporters ibs isthey do not know of this thing called other opinions .
 anyone who disagree with them is pap ib la ,  dogs la etc etc .

 during tekong time oso bathe cold water mah .
 somemore always bathe at night de .
 cos admin time is st night .
 that’s their way to make recruits shower faster .
 can ,  just have to bath faster .
 used to warm cold bath
 showering in cold water in a cold weather is good for your body sometimes .
 yes hot bath not that shiok compare in cold bath
 no i scare cold water
 been taking cold shower ever since my water heater spoil 2005
 i have been bathing cold tap water all these years .
 feels like angmo .
 dont even need water .
 did chiu say water heater ?
 i need the water heater otherwise it &apos;s too cold for me
 why not ,  once chiu get used to it .
 cold showers have lots of health benefits .
 my ns time basic training six mths i showered cold water .
 good for waking up early in the morning 
 but later get many mucus while day
 in the 80s ,  got water rationing exercise ,  more jialat than no heater

 weather so cool n nice no need to shower .
 save water save money save electricity save the enivironment .
 i vaguely remember .
 is msia threaten us or is drought .
 then we do water rationing .
 the illuminati can decide if its worth a million ,  or a cent at any point in time .

 buy is easy just give them money .
 maybe will go us100k
 sec oni allowed for futures etf ,  as gary gensler dont want investors to be exposed directly to the crypto space .
  becuz a regulatory crackdown on crypto is inevitable .
 that said ,  i do think sec will allow for an actual crypto etf eventually ,  once federal agencies have cleaned up the crypto market .
 by then ,  crypto market will become very muted and tamed .
 crypto is now very much driven by extreme leverage and wildcat stablecoins .
 if those 2 factors are tamed ,  crypto will lose much of its &apos; appeal to big time gamblers .
 there are 21mil bitcoin .
 assuming 20mil is available for purchase .
 at 5mil each ,  total need 100t .
 ts ,  please put on your assets on bitcoin ,  sure huat big time one .
 by the way how chiu sell bitcoins ?
 cause i see an article singapore mas oni allow a 30k selling annually oni to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing .
 actually is there any other usage for btc/crypto at the moment other than pure speculation ?
 the price can be google le ,  1 .
 5k oso have per laptop , depend yr hod want buy high end or low end laptop le
 now the it dept has merge the roles  .
 most tech  ,  infra and standby are done by same team .
 maybe is time to increase all of our wages .
 to prevent crimes or corruption .
 enough manpower meh .
 standard reply: there is no budget for additional headcount .
 sounds like what a project manager will say .
 the goal is to increase mgt wages first .
 ok so do u expect manager to do the work himself or allocate work ?
 if expected to allocate work to team members ,  then is it considered  &apos;arrowing &apos; them to do work ?
 suck thumb please .
 majority of sinkies want this to happen and continue to happen .
 im just agreeing with my ministers .
 if people are paid lowly ,  they will be corrupted and start committing crimes .
 what a shameful act  !
 so that he wont steal the laptops ?
 which apparently he did cos he needed the money ?
 moi thought high pay prevent corruption and it is high pay ?
 gahmen stuff oso dare to steal .
 and sell for so cheap some more !
 really is tao now pai !

 global times lol .
 always use singapore name to do its own bidding .
 another singapore dickson yeo
 lol the last paragraph is a whole load of crap haha
 never heard an idea that communicable for a scholar .
 looks like george yeo and kishore fighting each other over who can carry xi &apos;s balls best .
 i dont see any other prominent scholars or politicians in singapore see the need or act like them to carry usa &apos;s balls in such obscene manner .
 they keep on claiming that the west cant tell apart sinkie from prc ,  but kept using our name to publish articles ,  citation ,  publicity .
 so this discrepancy between words and action - what is it about ?
 the renowned scholars here got nothing to say ?
 kishore and george yeo should not represent singapore .
 someone really should call isd on these 2 and the gahment should consider issuing a warning for these ccp bootlicker .
 this global times is really one kind .
 not happy ,  will suan singapore .
 want to bootlick ccp ,  will use singapore &apos;s name to tackle others .
 of course nothing to say .
 dont burn money and bridges away .
 can join george yeo if million dollars post no more
 cant expect much from liars and cheats right ?
 if virus leaks from us lab ,  i guess they will allow international orgs to check .
 in fact ,  their own gahment and people will check clearly first .
 even the presidents of usa cant really hide anything from congress .
 there is rumour that the virus was tested on us soldier during their visit .
 the soldier fell ill ,  but recovered in us hospital cos he was very fit and healthy .
 thats why u hear wumaos put out fake info that us soldier plant it in wuhan causing the outbreak .
 the article says cheena has been transparent since the start ?
 didnt they arrest the doctor who warn others at the early stages of the virus ?
 this kisiao become ccp puppey ?
 arrested beat up and jailed many people like zhang zhan who just blogged about it .
 allow flights out of wuhan internationally but lockdown domestically .
 wont happen ,  too much to hide
 chiu say alot of crap on this forum but this one i agree with chiu bro
 shake liao go swab the hand see got any superior virus then sue him .
 vax and booster ,  no need scared
 lets go brandon !
 president biden coughed into his hand following a monday speech in new jersey and proceeded to use it to shake hands with members of the public ,  all while not wearing a mask .
 the incident comes less than a week after homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas tested positive for covid just days following an event with the president .
 last tuesday ,  a fully vaccinated mayorkas tested positive for covid as part of routine pre-travel protocols .
 let’s go ,  brandon !
 for his age is risky
 boost one more should be fine

 chiu should knock on the door ,  state rank ,  name and ic after that say  &apos;permission to enter sir !
 once he ask chiu to come in chiu must salute him and say  &apos;permission to sit sir !
 once he say ok and then chiu must greet him  &apos;good morning/afternoon/evening sir !
 then proceed with your diagnosis .
 this is the sop ,  if never follow it is expected to kena guailan by the ceca .
 usually chiu walk in ,  is doctor say hi to chiu first thing .
 it’s basic manners right ?
 a good doctor will treat the condition not the symptom .
 these are rare .
 nice csb   the amount of hate on ceca is unimaginable in this forum  
 sometimes doctor say hi first .
 sometimes he might be busy typing the previous patient &apos;s prescription .
 no need so geh gao bah .
 norm is u knock in door 1st before enter ,  doc look up and greet chiu with your name after looking at your record details .
 never encountered a doc accepting next patient without clearing the paper work of the last 1st .
 why i dont go polyclinic: .
 doctor there dont put in enough effort to understand your issue .
 (to me ,  they really oni can diagnose straight forward issues which oni take few minutes for my visits years ago .
 i tell them what i think and they agree with me .
 wait time is long .
 (both to see doc and oso collect med) .
 have not visited polyclinic for many years oredi .
 but leong is local wor .
 maybe nus grad some more .
 how can be bad ?
 haha maybe my doctor not normal .
 but got no issues with him .
 cos when i greet him first .
 he will greet back and apologize ask me hang on .
 even some of the straight forward symptoms they oso cant get it right .
 one good example is from post #3 in this thread .
 that is why chiu must always test your doctor .
 his doc cert might be fake one .
 dont dwell too much on the unhappy incidents/events .
 try to focus on your medical issues and see if chiu can get more medical assistance and referrals .
 i &apos;ve met my fair share of medical staff who forgotten about empathy .
 of course ,  there are some who still have passion ,  empathy and high level of skills in their job .
 when my health was in jeopardy ,  i realise it is pointless to harp on other unimportant matters or make a fuss in on trivial matters .
 i wish to do that .
 my feet not very cooperative today .
 take 15 minutes longer from my usual 5 minutes route .
 the pain the just crazy .
 all your previous consultations information should be on the doctor &apos;s pc the moment chiu walked in .
 i ask them to reponse to me by phone .
 actually will be no issue one if the school monitor from the beginning say i know and should have it handled better .
 next time i will do better .
 everyone will sua and move on .
 even the laolan school principal will have to let it go .
 but who ask the school monitor act hero and be kuailan talk back at vice principal for 9 hours .
 now the school wanna confiscate the school monitor phone to see all the whatsapp .
  he this time jialat liao ,  dunno got what other secrets are inside the phone .
 change the teacher .
 i one person cheat can pull down my monitor and dad kym ?
 who ask chiu to cheat and the school monitor to kuailan .
 he is the school monitor for a reason .
 anyway ,  grown up world is liddat one .
 chiu make a mistake nia ,  people buaysong with chiu will shoot chiu one .
 now 39% of the class jumping like primates insisting school monitor is not wrong .
 my dad is innocent
 i oso can’t remember how i went through it during ns .
 mai keep referring back to last time la .
 now ask chiu every other day do soc ,  ippt ,  4d3n outfield exercise ,  fibua ,  atec ,   .
 u can tahan boh ?
 i didn’t bathe 
 2 days ago when it was warmer ,  i took a cold shower at 8pm
 dont remember me ever got it that frequently 
 used to it oredi .
 every morning cold water bath .
 more refreshed and less likely to sweat thro the morning .
 stepping out of the shower cubicle was super cold .
 have to dry and wear the clothings while inside the glass shower cubicle .
 last few days not that bad .
 powder bath lor
 ts never go through army ?
 more than a year le .
 your teacher is she listed on sugar baby website ?
 she always bend over for her paymaster right ?
 thats why when her paymaster tell her to fail people ,  she die die will do .
 if i cheat during exam how come my school monitor oso will kena punish ?
 your dissociative disorder come again ah ?
 the school monitor havent kena punished leh .
 no one being punished yet ,  not even chiu .
 anyway who ask the school monitor come and act hero be kuailan to vice principal for 9 hours .
 now see the phone records ,  who knows what dirt will come up .
 sounds like jav plot
 in anot simple thread
 dad should get death sentence .
 so i guess someone poke your backside before oso lol
 chiu didn’t even get the crux .
 teacher is verifying to see if it’s your dad who taught chiu to cheat .
 if it was your dad has no credibility .
 if it wasn’t you’re on your own
 why chiu study in a lousy school ?
 chiurs dads shoulds kneels and appologizes for raisings a char siews 
 school teacher oredi call my whole family down for interview .
 i one person cheat got such a big saga i feel very ashamed .
 the teacher must make sire he’s v white .
 v pure  ,  no single error to hold such standards .
 n that means below him all must b similar else who is he to punish the father .
 wait for promo very long liao leh
 i saw some say nice ,  want to try but a bit too ex
 inside got lotus ?
 go ice cream uncle buy vanilla ice cream ask him put in cup then go ntuc buy lotus biscuits .
 maybe cos no need clear stock .
 they serve lotus biscuit w/ their mccafe coffees
 probably run out of expiring-soon cheap-sale biscuits .
 aiya teach chiu all la just buy the lotus biscoff spread vanilla ice cream and the biscuit from cold storage or shopee or whatever then ownself make for sure 100% taste better .
 and if chiu like the macdonalds ice cream then chiu buy the cone ownself make loh
 ah dou sue terry xu by proxy to warn everyone not to spread sibling side of story cos the offical one is the one in parliament .
 siblings give ammo to lt is to hoot ah dou by proxy .
 whoever who hoot first is guilty of betraying the family .
 although i do wish ah dou sue them directly so i can finally jiak my popcorn .
 total love your tots on ah dou suing sibling .
 popcorn jinx ho  .
 even this type of site oso got these cb ib .
 see the comments there .
 desperate pinky and his cronies
 the oni enemy more dangerous than a man with unlimited resources is one with nothing to lose .
 p m lee indeed got unlimited resources but lt isn’t going to win this one  .
 haha too bad llst oppies
 same reason why everyone thinks ufo goh is pap mole ?
 cos doofu spend 90% of his time bashing wp rather than pap  .
 and chiu seems quite liberal in calling others wp ibs too ,  a case of pot calling kettle black ?
 again ,  one does not need to be wp ib to speak in fairness for them .
 i spoke up for dr chee against cst ibs in previous thread too .
 in all honesty ,  i feel dr chee will make a bigger impact in parliament then wp .
 however that does not diminish wp contributions and the fact that wp gain strength to strength in each election is a testament that their strategy resonates with the voters 
 oni people with ulterior motives will harp on their narrow definition of what their ideal oppo is .
 currently with pap &apos;s domination of seats ,  there is still no need for oppo to quarrel .
 those people who like to see oppo quarrel are often the ibs .
 old wp ib trick .
 cannot refute come and play dictionary .
 did they object to the medishield premium increase ?
 nothing to say right ?
 wanna play dictionary .
 chiu mean like in 2015 when they lost punggol back and escape with aljunied by 50 .
 95% plus votes ah .
 liddat call strength to strength ah .
 what chiu smoking ?
 i know cannabis is legalised in other countries .
 singapore still cannot ok .
 how is it not strength when they managed to hold on to aljunied and hougang and oni lost punggol east which they oni just won in 2013 by election and when the rest of the oppo got decimated ?
 the fact remains that in 2015 election there was a wide swing towards pap due to the lky factor and it affected all oppo .
 despite that wp did credibly amid the swing .
 credit has to be given for their resilience .
 stirring sai is good for bbfas edmw  .
 the key issue should be who is the one to cause the problem and not who should be the one to stop the problem .
 so the main culprit is still the one who raise the premium ,  right ?
 chiu should be going after them instead ,  and not going after someone for not stopping them .
 stop twisting around like a caught snake .
 thats the year old fart pass away and there was a national swing of 10-15% sympathy votes and sg50  &apos;feel good &apos; votes for your masters .
 unfortunately one can oni die once  .
 one knows wp is doing something right when pap directed all their resources and ibs to bash them ,  especially jamus  when  csj and lim tean are the more aggro one on social media  .
 look at kj haha ,  other than his legendary 2015 meme ,  none give a fark and none of your fellow fap ibs even bother with him 
 many wp supporters ibs or whatever do not find themselves in agreement with lim tean &apos;s way of politicking and stirring .
 u hit the nail .
 find the root cause .
 most our problems r self created .
 drop to 50% considered strength to strength ah .
 your standard low is your standard low .
 got object or never object .
 cannot answer my point start insulting my childhood etc .
 old wp ib tactic la .
 please take skillsfuture go upgrade la .
 small leftover residue from the bitkingdom scam refund .
 it was oni 200+ sgd per btc in 2014 .
 it will go and down like see-saw .
 and i do not sell .
 take it as money gone and see how it grows in 10 years time .
 either really a scam or make me richer .
 before that happens ,  i think a crackdown will be done loh .
  by then ,  maybe oni black market use this as currency ?
 sell cats sell horses all in nao@ !
 gahment should slap hard on btc waste energy
 maybe i will invest $1000 .
 can huat big or not
 as long as all the criminal networks of money launderers ,  drug cartels etc and large investors continue to back this crypto and dont mass offload their btc ,  expect it to continue to rise indefinitely .
 there is no regulation  ,   stabilising system or physical commodity to back this vapour currency other than a digital ledger .
 eth and btc are both seriously overpriced liao .
 eth is just a network for gas fee ,  and people still thinking it will go $10k .
 most people buy things that they dunno ,  and got their hands burnt .
 btc is overpriced due to limited supply .
 even though i quite heavily invested (gambled) in crypto ,  i dont believe bitcoin itself will be 5 million one day 
 when everyone knows about a so called secret ,  time to dump .
 crypto will not be allowed in the crypto space .
 sooner or later it will be tamed .
 all the hardcore gamblers will be in for the big surprise .
 someone finally got it ,  btc is not for investment .
 no wonder my friend still using his warehouse to mine bitcoin
 for me is i oni have backside to sell 
 blockchain ,  but that doesnt mean btc is worth that much also
 according to moi panel of 10000 analysts ,  btc will moon to $500mil by 2030 
 ownself vested of course say become 5 million la .
 if not say 5 cents meh ?
 if chiu bought shiba inu 2 weeks ago .
 flipflopping is the worse of both worlds
 have final concert first la at indoor stadium
 if they are there just to monitor and report ,  they might as well pay us their salaries .
 we &apos;re oredi doing it here .
 mtf stands for many things fail ?
 they really need to get in consultants like from mckinsey or something to help them map out what they need to do .
 chiu might have the brightest minds in the world but if your thought process and framework is not worked out you’re always playing catch up .
 chiu think chiu can have 1000 icu capacity and then don’t consider overwork on the rest of the hospital areas .
 chiu think chiu can have 1500 cases and have adequate phone and support ,  obviously something is not correct .
 since the mtf is not medically trained then no reason why they cannot hire top consultants to help with the planning process and to do a bit of bottom up prep
 from israel and other endemic approach data ,  we oredi know few thousands cases per day is the outcome .
 what puzzling is we didn’t build more community care facilities before rushing to declare endemic .
 it’s very difficult for some family for home quarantine - too many household members  ,  not enough toilet  ,  food ,  old young people .
  better we try to now find more spaces like reservist camps to house them and get the whole saf to help out .
 cos they thought everyone rich enough to  &apos;home recovery &apos;  .
 they thought every house have at least 2 bedrooms with toilets attached .
 cos they themselves live in such houses .
 just like dr koh last time say ,  every family has a car ,  his family got 2 cars .
 means oredi lost touch with the ground long ago .
 not really bah ,  overseas angmo countries alot oredi outdoor no masks from videos and livestreamings ,  all go clubbing and sports stadiums full etc .
 issue is whether chiu can tahan this tag by having enough hospitalisation care at the start and tank forward or not .
 that said ,  would be better to have some safety assurance for kids though ,  so oni time will tell .
 it &apos;s this vs marnee
 going ntuc now  
 bro go sing song .
 good veggie on offer .
 our hospitals before covid oredi running at near max capacity due to the population increase and aging population .
 now still have to squeeze out blood to accommodate surge due to covid .
 the most jlb do nothing force .
 even saf more useful .
 we just need president ho and calvin to form new mtf
 moreover staffs r shortage .
 last year i brought my mum to sgh ,  waited 4 hrs to register ,  see dr and take medicine .
 new hospital like ktp  ,  u will see many ft doctors !
 and don’t forget to go zoo and recruits some donkey too 
 at least cb after i finish ict lei ,  otherwise no count lei
 chiu all can see oyk  &apos;s kpi was not on cases at all ,  his was on gdp ,  open up and let ceca in .
 if he monitored  the cases ,  by 500 should have reduced people interaction ,  but instead he was still trying full steamed ahead to open up and oso let ceca in .
 loo want the cake and eat it .
 who gives a fark what they think .
 not happy show themselves to the door .
 its always open for them to get out
 i see my msian corlick spend more on food ,  end up more bbfa .
 they always unhappy with sinkies .
 just wanna milk us nia .
 these msian pr will never drop msia citizenship for singapore .
 either suck thumb or fug off lah
 this one oso locals will be liddat .
 but least they can go back retire there when old ,  we still stay here need to pick up cardboard for exercise when retire .
 start a #gohome challenge for all .
 who not happy can go home .
 who did they vote for ?
 they are unappreciative of 1:3 .
 if chiu ask jhk ,  they will be upset with covid in general and their own incompetent gahment / politicians .
 hardly any of them will be upset with pap unlike what ts said .
 they change go back x3 to feed 5 children and their landed property got say thank chiu ?
 i met one msian accountant sibei haolian earning 6-7k sgd  .
 during visiting her eyes look at ceiling one .
 jhk mostly are lazy and opportunist .
 can go home what .
 and dont come back !
 hmmm ,  ts stir based on what ?
 really easy to stir up sentiments here in edmw sia .
 they arent trapped here .
 can always choose to go home and go through the quarantine process if they want .
 if they choose not to ,  it &apos;s their own damn problem ask them go kum lup cheong .
 they can forgo the sgd one lo
 please deport all of them
 luckily i know my medicine well ,  and make sure he precribe me the correct one .
 yah lor yah lor .
 they can input my queue number n call me in .

 this type of thread deserve to be sticky .
 ts no longer around ?
 can ask y people say put tank in mall .
 meaning of syt  .
 put tank in a mall = putang ina mo ,  filipino for  &apos;ur mom is a whore &apos; .

 1st page last updated 2013 .
 needs a refresh .
 for everyone &apos;s sanity !
 need to add new terms leh .
 luffymonkey doesnt seem to be active oredi .
 probably will either need to assign an active user as the threadstarter ,  or to assign a mod/admin to do the edits .
 hope someone can be assigned to maintain this thread .
 paging for bosssaizo when he returns tomorrow morning .
 im mr meeseeks ,  look at me !
 - hardwarezone forums app
 if can make it a sticky thread will be even better .
 i havent used the term nmnhnblm for some time .
 didnt know got this joke before .
 golden cheese pie ?
 what to expect from a country way bigger and powerful than us ?
 ot ,  i love your quokka .
 are u sure cheena is still powerful ?
 someone from lee kuan yew school of public policy again ?
 simply not surprised .
 when the most apparent source has not been thoroughly investigated yet and now asking to shift attention & resources to some other place will oni end up finding out nothing in the end .
 chances this “singaporean” cant be found
 yup impersonation to do illegal activity or make statement that is beneficial to cheena .
 maybe is wumao tiong anyhow take a sinkie name and use
 if cheena is  &apos;more powerful &apos; than singapore ,  why would wumaos use our name to carry out their own diplomacy ?
 insecure mah ,  they feel   .
 like a siao zhabor chiu know
 ask them to wave their own flag la .
 by powerful i mean it &apos;s still a significant threat to us .
 i dont think it &apos;s a diplomacy issue .
 it &apos;s purely a political issue .
 if later us agree and who find nothing then how ?
 all attention will be on singapore liao whole world will see singapore as a bigger dog to cheena than even nk .
 it just shows that whether tiongs ,  or ceca ,  or sinkie chinese ,  or sinkie indians ,   .
 all capable of being snakes .
 it is not about the race ,  but individuals .
 how to be a threat ?
 so far away ,  and singapore dunnid cheena ,  but cheena need singapore .
 hard ccp truths !
 us  not stupid .
 they can discern who wrote that article
 kishore was misquoted and his word taken out of context by globaltimes .
 cn ,  not his fault
 i think both cheena and singapore need each other ,  but i suspect singapore stands to benefit more from cheena ,  provided they play fair .
 the problem is that cheena isnt willing to and singapore is sometimes directly or indirectly impacted (mostly due to asean matters) .
 the best example is australia when cheena plays such tricks .
 singapore so far has escaped unscathed cos we didnt push our luck .
 if our gahment is any dumber ,  we could be the next australia .
 thats the kind of threat cheena is to singapore .
 wont be surprised ,  but if he doesnt step out and clarify ,  he is oso not doing himself any favors
 singapore dunnid cheena .
 hard cheena truths .
 i dont understand  .
 why the  bios locked laptop is not enable .
 oni the owner knows the master key/password .
 no body will buy a bios lock laptop
 he can reformat it before selling le
 chiu dunno what is bios lock laptop .
 dont be a smart alec .
 give chiu some clue .
 everytime chiu restart or turn on the laptop  .
 it asked for user password (not master password or key) .
 with this feature if it is not remove  .
 people would not buy it
 i school om last time .
 the engineer just have to call hotline ,  ask officer to generate a long code , then he can unlock the bios code le .
 after that he can go to bios setting to switch this function to off can le
 i worked in hp and dell desktop and laptop services center before .
 hp and dell told me cannot .
 i called in before .
 if chiu dunno the master key / password .
 they have to change the whole motherboard .
 and oni after they verified with the owner of the laptop they can change the motherbord .
 the owner must have the invoice and the cc information used to purchase the laptops .
 it come with a fee even the laptop warranty is not expired
 cos last time a engineer in school tell me can .
 or maybe he do for other hack and i misinterpret it as disable the bios lock ?
 laptops are physical items ,  very easy to check missing .
 if want to eat money ,  must be something virtual and not physical ,  my previous company eat gahment dunno how much money ,  buy virtual items and claim money from gahment under edg grant ,  business grant ,  productivity grant ,  sme grant etc ,  close to 1 .
 i suspect many pte companies are doing it too
 lowballed in caurosell 
 stopped reading at muhammad .
 why am i not surprised ?
 they can start by auditing all the lanjiao skillfuture courses first
 so many noobs here  the bios password can be disabled or reset to default by adjusting the dip switch or jumper on the motherboard ,  bios is low level circuit programming ,  can be hacked physically
 moh laptops tend to be special healthcare one .
 heard most of them are thinkpad t490 with sarkit i7 somemore .
 moh bought those at overpriced 1 .
 3k and this yelam sold it at 300 lol .
 moh can really sleep well
 alot of these money is gone to  &apos;agencies &apos; .
 no need to guess who open these agencies or pte .
 the logic is the same like the court vs the country ruler ,  court cannot sue the ruler cos the court people bosses are dogs to the ruler
 desktop can but .
 new laptop cannot even taken out the battery oso cannot clear the master key password .
 cause i dell dcse certified one
 he is refering to laptop
 now they talking abt this lenovo laptop why cannot take out battery ?
 certified yr lanjiso .
 dell batt is damn easy to unlock ,  u just need to remove the cover ,  unscrew the center and side screws ,  the batt is the first thing u see
 for newer laptop ,  the batt is just inside ,  u just need to remove the cover
 sure got a way to bypass this bios pw le .
 if not a person forget the bios pw how ?
 mckinsey got expertise in such areas meh ?
 personally i feel hor ,  origjnal team of mtf is doing a good job .
 but their big boss says i want economic growth and high vaccination rate .
 so the task became more difficult to do .
 yea is quite funny why health minister has to meddle with ceca  .
 endemic is the oni path to go .
 but then their execution is weak .
 they should expect 10k cases per day ,  use that to plan capacity etc
 mtf got experience ?
 what i dont understand is why the gahment still have not deployed the army to set up field hospital .
 move the current traffic out of the hospital and into the army field hospital .
 let the field hospital be the first line of defense .
 check the patients .
 serious the  send to hospital .
 not serious send home .
 middle ground send to community care facility .
 it wi be a big issue for singapore if our army is not capable to deploy a basic field hospital .
 singapore will sink faster .
 papship still praising health minister .
 every thing is fine .
 by the way ,  india situation is getting better ,  is it cause of exporting the virus to other countries ?
 if really spore endemic .
 spore still need 1k bed this n that ?
 wa ,  good idea .
 people always have the  &apos;this must be a major disaster &apos; thought anytime the military is activated  .
 ministars want to avoid being seen as losing control of the situation
 so what &apos;s going to happen if the infection number going higher  ?
 im not so sure about this .
 i think cheena is slowly grabbing singapore by the neck and forcing us to choose a side
 all the fake angmos here panicked at the thought that angmo usa need to open up for independent investigation .
 obviously angmo usa got something to hide as far as the origin of covid is concerned .
 was kishore the ps when george yeo was mfa minister  ?
 which one radicalised the other  ?
 nice to see the 3g leaders carrying the translator culture from lky
 wow wonder how many of us here tio report on this post
 when was the last time who visited us ?
 isd should really start doing their jobs .
 too many translators in red dot is working for ccp .
 are they hiding something ?
 imo ,  both cheena and us should be investigated thoroughly .
 from looks of it ,  the virus might have originated from us but wuhan biolab oso potentially leaked the virus due accidents in the experiments .
 both countries are the highest suspects for now .
 most of them have very negative mentality .
 haven’t try oredi say will fail .
 say what sinkie girls oni want rich and handsome men .
 but actually they dont even have female frens but come such conclusion by reading toxic comments online .
 every day cai png ,  watch netflix/anime and pcc ,  think gf will drop from sky ?
 just look around u lor .
 punggol hdb so many young  sinkie couples .
 u think the guy rich will stay hdb meh .
 they can get married why cant u .
 or punggol is just another slum to edmwers ?
 no ,  i think gf will climb out from my toilet bowl .
 and lazy to dress up for the date too
 they dont put in effort oso ,  oni want to take but not give .
 single guys are the smartest cause they don’t get pwned by women charter .
 and freedom to be alpha
 someday she will drop from the sky    .
 inbefore continue dreaming
 why must guy go after girl ,  girl cannot go and talk to guy meh ?
 gender equality mah
 lazy to entertain nonsense also… .
 priest dont poke the knife deeper into moi glass heart .
 its true ,  moi think is humji  .
 humji how to get gf ?
 humji become bbfa loh
 they are just bbfa who hiam dino bu  
 i have female friends .
 i chat with them now and then .
 the problem is that we are all expired .
 the girls themselves gave up liao ,  finding themselves too old to get married and they know that they cannot get what they want .
 we go out pre covid .
 still waiting to at least restore back to 8 ,  so that our gathering can resume .
 5 is neither here or there and leaving out is not nice .
 but we keep on keeping to the same social circles ,  then we wont be meeting anyone new .
 asking the girls to go expand their circle oso dont want .
 not on app ,  not on sdn .
 what chiu need is actually getting the women not to give up and to give in .
 easier said than done .
 it is never easy to cut .
 i have seen some of nice guys (married already) trying to convince them and end up being shouted at instead .
 works both way .
  they themselves must be grade a stuff oso then fair enough .
 many other factors la ,  so not for most ba imo .
 who is the one who is twisting like a short snake .
 the key issue is whoseh wanna go in stop blank cheque ?
 on national tv some more ?
 the increase in medishield premiums is possibly the biggest blank cheque in this term .
 and they never go stop .
 wp is doing right thats why pap support .
 in the televised debate ,  they omitted lim tean from it .
 and vivian focussed his attacks on csj .
 at the same time ,  smile smile flirt with wp jamus .
 so who are the ones that pap garner resources to bash ?
 who is the real threat ?
 i answer one thing to another guy .
 chiu come in and ask me another thing to twist my answer .
 the fact remains that lim tean was excluded from the televised debate .
 and vivian was far more aggressive to csj .
 as for jamus ,  vivian was on the brink of sending him flirting eyes .
 so chiu tell me ?
 why pap give wp special treatment leh ?
 is it cause they know wp will not say no to issues such as increase in medishield premiums ?
 but instead extensive fake debate about min wage when pwm was in place ?
 chiu seem to be very bitter that lt is not elected and blame everyone else .
 no one tried to cockblock him ,  chiu should be blaming the residents in that constituency for not electing your hero in .
 yes ,  jamus did say not to give pap a blank cheque ,  pap still get a blank cheque in the end cos the 60% like chiu refused to do something about it .
 hope in my lifetime can see him slam someone in parliament
 bitter or sweet chiu oso know .
 sound like chiu tasting cum .
 typical wp ibs tactic .
 stop making excuse la .
 ask your masters to go stop the blank cheque la .
 when jamus open his big mouth oso say wp will not form gahment .
 dont make excuses like 60% or 10 seats .
 so chiu know the answer which is they never make an issue out of the increase in medishield premium .
 dont come and play dictionary games about what is make an issue la .
 old wp ib tactic .
 so that we end up arguing about what is make an issue instead of the real facts .
 upgrade a bit la .
 go buangkok see your htr ah ?
 in the previous elections ,  it was never limited to top 4 .
 oni this election .
 anything else to add ?
 as usual ,  simi calvin cheng is commander .
 as far as wp ib peasants are concerned ,  disagree with them are all calvin chengs .
 do chiu have wet dreams about him and his donkey face ?
 knn ,  why dont chiu go fark your masters for increasing the premium ?
 your master shite all over the place and chiu blame the road sweeper for not cleaning up the turd ?
 chiu hoseh boh ?
 talk to chiu nicely ,  chiu dont understand ,  need people to fark chiu then chiu wake up .
 not going to waste my time with chiu anymore .
 i know your type .
 cannot rebut then come say fark masters liao and talk tough .
 chiu probably oni dare to use words like fark behind keyboard right .
 thats why say until so song .
 in real life ,  chiu probably let the 8 year old boy scold oso dont dare to talk back one right .
 that said ,  chiu are a typical representation of wp supporter/ib .
 play dictionary word games .
 cannot answer then diam la .
 so in 2015 when they almost reduced to one .
 u oso say voters eye bright bright ah ?
 chiu think every year got covid for wp to capitalise on angry voters who wait in long queue ah ?
 chiu use pap policies to defend your wp .
 if they want ,  they can have more than five people via zoom one lor .
 dunnid to be in the same room .
 want or not oni .
 if chiu watch the 2015 debate .
 denise phua famously asked lw to  &apos;help me out here &apos; when she was grilled by lim tean .
 i would have loved to see csj and lt 2v1 on vivian .
 anyway ,  i will stop here la .
 wait people complain i derail this thread .
 dunno wor ,  but now 35% premium increase is permanent right .
 we see next election how loh  .
 angry lim can win jb angry medishield voters mah .
 if still cant win means increased premium doesnt matter for sinkie and chiu barking up wrong tree  .
 cant be skers angry for long queue vote for wp but jber still happy with pap for increasing their medishield premium right 
 chiu useless son .
   just give chiu rotan ,  end of story .
  nothing to do with your dad or what he has to say .
  how your dad run the family nothing to do with breaking school rules .
  and chiu dont try to spoil your father’s reputatio .
 did chiur dad complain chiur teacher told him dotch interrupt when teacher talks ?
 your dad must fight back to clear the truth ,  oni the truth will set him free .
 as for chiu whom kena caught cheating ,  prepared to face public caning in school by your principal
 i think it depends on your relationship with your dad .
 if your dad has absolute control over chiu and chiu are totally submissive to him to the extent of not even being allowed to be an adult ,  then yes ,  your dad is responsible and must be punished by public caning and thousand hours of detention .
 however ,  if your dad told chiu  &apos;son .
 one has to be accountable for their own action .
 that is the sign of maturity and a sign of manhood .
 chiu are a leader and yet chiu cheated ,  how can chiu expect your followers to respect chiu or hold chiu in high regards in the future .
 together with your uncles and aunties ,  we beseech chiu to grow up and admit your mistakes .
 we will not force chiu to admit and it is all up to chiu .
  &apos; ,  then chiu oni have yourself to blame and chiu are a piece of char siew who got your whole family into trouble .
 cause chiu are blue house .
 if chiu are white house ,  chiu open book during exam oso they close both eyes .
 teacher punish dad make him lick her backside
 teacher is oni want dad to come in two the true .
 but dad keep insisting he told ts not to lie and claim ts need to see psychiatrist .
 teacher oni want dad to tell the truth but clueless ts think is punishing dad
 rk saga scripts
 yup i blame lee kuan yew
 not a simpur thread
 oni happens to sinkie… .
 other country cheat everyday everything oso nothing happen .
 come here become bonafide
 this type of story is getting lame in edmw .
 tell your teacher to test the evidence with her hypothesis .
 the useless teacher oso demand for the father personal income tax which is not related to chiu cheating ?
 the story should goes like this  .
 chiu are a special needs low iq sisi student .
 chiu cheated in exams .
 the teacher saw and knew chiu cheated in exams .
 chiu admit to teacher chiu cheated .
 but the teacher choose to close one eye cos your dad was some big shot .
 subsequently chiu cheated again and again  .
 was finally caught .
 chiu baotoh to the school disciplinary say your teacher knew but close one eye .
 your teacher kena call up  .
 admitted she knew chiu cheated 3 mths ago .
 but cos she feels  chiu are special needs low iq  .
 she gave chiu a choice to own up .
 but the thing she didnt foreseen is chiu so stupid go and cheat and cheat again .
 your teacher finds that she is not at fault cos  .
 of your special needs status  .
 needs to give chiu room to own up .
 go tell your dad chiu cheated .
 dad should eat this charsiew
 is call party whip .
 chiu are just a small fly ,  punishing chiu does not do enough damage .
 punishing your dad can extend the damage to your whole family .
 unfilial son should harakiri & bring his sins to the grave .
 that was the subject of the exam .
 walan why this thread so fast die off liao  ?
 i like the story ley  .
 wondered what will the outcum be  ?
 i need to turn my tv into video conference ready by start of june .
 any good webcam i can order ?
 get the most cui webcam .
 there is no need to be clear
 for me ,  it &apos;s usually done on my phone or tablet .
 oni use laptop when i need to present stuff .
 just wondering ,  why do u need to use a tv for your video calls ?
 and if it &apos;s what your co wants ,  why arent they providing the necc devices .
 too many participants .
 tv easier to see everyone
 cannot la ,  need to cover backside .
 i bought a $20 webcam from lazada and seemed to be ok .
 no brand type but reviews quite ok .
 any 720p ,  1080p webcams can oredi .
 $5 webcam on shopee will do the trick .
 order now 1-2weeks ltr come just nice .
 they want the 3:1 so be it .
 if they are unhappy then they can go back once they can and dont ever return .
 and thats none of our business it &apos;s their choice .
 they are unhappy cos they finally have to contribute back to our economy for once and see why we sinkies always kpkb about the cost of living in relation to salary for once .
 edmwers stirring hatred again .
 not happy go back to your own country .
 not happy just go back malaysia .
 whao lao ,  this oso can use meh ?
 buay song then just go bck
 another jhk sob story to go with cny .
 these jhk should rally the king to leave the sinking federation and join singapore for better tomorrow .
 jhk cannot go home n brag abt their pay n lord it over their more buay gan relatives
 should let them go back .
 dont let them come in .
 troublemaker si jhk .
 they have a choice .
 jhk not invited here .
 if johor secede from federation and independent maybe got chance to unite otherwise confirm no chance .
 and yes sultanate of johor once control large parts of malaysia and parts of indon islands .
 1:3 too difficult to resist .
 ok ,  anyhow guess oso managed to guess correctly .
 oh ,  i am quite good with mcqs .
 trust my gut feel .
 why this thread no get sticky ?
 please explain what is bbfa ?
 keep seeing this .
 bui bui forever alone .
 got other version though .
 angmo dua liap - to describe big chest caucasian woman .
 ib internet bridage .
 this really need an update .
 for example i dont seem to find gnd and no idea what it meant .
 bookmarked for reference
 what is leleles  ?
 good thread worth a bump up .
 mods ,  please ban ts .
 newers laptops have dip switch ,  u just need to open the laptop and adjust it
 then why got dell expert say there is no way to disable bios password ?
 expert his kukuhead ,  anything can be hacked as long as related to computer hw or sw
 unless chiu buy for selling again or very knowledgable in it ,  nobody knows/care about bios being locked out .
 normal users dont understand this .
 they can open windows is happy oredi .
 just reformat everything ,  and can reinstall the windows .
 corporate laptop is more expensive than the retail laptop .
 thats cos it comes with the different contract agreement and different os edition .
 if chiu enable bios password restart reboot during laptop start up .
 it will be annoying for any new buyer to get the laptop with bios password prompt for every boot up and restart / reboot .
 no body will  buy a laptop with bios password prompt for every boot up and restart / reboot .
 reformat and reinstall the os will not erase the bios user password prompt  bios password prompt for every boot up and restart / reboot .
 oni the master key or admin key password can disable the the bios user password prompt  bios password prompt for every boot up and restart / reboot
 is this the reason why many of us received scam calls from  &apos;moh &apos; ?
 are chiu suggesting to enable to bios password ?
 so are chiu saying ,  corporate users must enter bios password whenever they login in the morning ?
  this is to prevent someone stole and re-sell it again ?
 dell dcse certified .
 the manufacturer told us .
 why they have that feature in the bios .
 why chiu cannot erase the password if chiu do not know the master key password .
 who need those feature .
 and the instructions from dell  and hierarchy work flow and flow chart to work those bios and laptop security properly .
 ​and how dell deal with dell stolen property  .
 or people who do not know the master key password once the master key password is deployed .
 all dell products must be registered  with owner information and credentials on dell database .
 moi fwend asking  .
 yes treatment is wear specs 
 it &apos;s a natural process after 40 .
 zoom not practical ,  too many technical issues can occur ,  not to mention hijacked .
 otherwise ,  ya ,  would love to see lt+csj grill lhl .
 i think oni pinky and shanmugam  have the skills to debate with lt and csj .
 i dont see anybody else in pap could handle those 2 .
 maybe vivian b .
 chiu put those 2 in parliament and chiu will have to stock up loads of popcorn .
 yes ,  prepare popcorn .
 i thought pinky is the shiit stirrer since he started the suit ?
 lulz his orgasm must have sexploded dunno unitl which galaxy  
 lol end of day is the number that matters .
 not even one third seats u cannot block any motions
 politics is see numbers one .
 your gang big big people scared of chiu tell u piak piak in small spaces people oni ask how small ?
 your gang small small no matter how noble chiu are people think u up to no good stir trouble .
 come from lanfang republic lor .
 can chiu imagine the oxley debate with lt and csj inside .
 please look at how wp charged into marine parade and macpherson in 2015 before talking la .
 jbesar are the older voters leh .
 they benefit from the increased premiums from the young leh .
 they enjoy coverage nia .
 anyway sk and east coast somehow had to go to the bigger centres while the older hdb estates had it near their void decks .
 i may not be accurate in this la .
 just based on the news reports .
 actually oxley is really a family affair .
 would prefer to see them debate on national issues .
 but between that and no debate ,  ok ,  having oxley is better .
 looking back ,  lky whenever he sued ,  he has never lost .
 certainly wish for history to change now .
 i wish for a precedence in singapore law whereby logic can prevail and political figures should not bully people .
 there is no logic to be able to selectively choose who to sue .
 imagine the situation where there is fraud case involving family members and outsider .
 justifiable to sue oni the outsider ?
 and if the outsider loses legal suit and is penalised ,  fined and maybe jailed ,  does it mean family members go scot free ?
 makes no sense
 wp is the most useless party ever .
 4 heavenly kings
 dont forget vivian bala ,  top debater hok !
 not under oath and under oath .
 neck on the line .
 i got friends who went romania to study medicine and became doctors in europe .
 give middle finger to singapore elitist medical industry
 so did they sue him for the money ?
 he was prosecuted by mom and fined s$70 , 000 on jun 24 this year for working without a valid work pass ,  said the mom spokesperson .
 665000 and oni collected more than 10% .
 hope they ban him from singapore for life
 thats how chiu calculate la .
 nowadays children mostly char siew .
 once chiu sponsored them their university education ,  they dont bother to pay chiu back .
 so many jiu hu talents .
 if $ is your oni concern ,  lawyers will be better .
 especially unethical ones .
 sad to see parents sending their kids for academic and asking roi in return .
 it means asking your kids to pay u back when he starts to work .
 is there such contract agreement ?
 go teach part time in uni as prof can earn alot more .
 that why alot of doc doing that
 people oni work for money .
 chiu think anyone works for career satisfaction ?
 i oni agree to some extent oni .
 if $ is the oni concern for everyone ,  the most majors in uni will disappear liao .
 those pure science ,  history ,  arts majors will all disappear .
 even the most celebrated scientist albert einstein is not even rich .
 provided can pass the medical course .
 must have interest .
 doctor job is suitable for them .
 i have friend who has a medical degree but he is not a doctor .
 those people do these kind of majors all got difficulty finding jobs oso what .
 unless their backgrounds damn up there ,  they take these degrees to be vases at home .
 but a locum doctor can work 8-9 hours a day ,  6-7 days a week .
 how many hours can an academic teach part time in a week ?
 oni if your child can make it
 in other words ,  they study for interest lor .
 if can ,  they would want work in places of interest ,  albeit for lower pay .
 every jc batch oso got some weirdos .
 all as from rjc but major in arts .
 then end up work at some small design firm .
 if gone for laws or medicine ,  these people chao chao 5-10 times richer
 they clds bes lichs buts stills goes for bto and frips 
 can be whatever he imagines himself to be ?
 i think maybe due to past experiences ,  like they tried ?
 but either not they want ,  or those guys married or just want fwb/ons etc .
 or someone they like but the guy dont like them ,  so they give up .
 thats just my experience when chatting with most of them .
 they want angmo ,  rich and handsome .
 i am waiting for android gf to be launched
 girls have to get guys to bto .
 shouldn &apos;t it be easier ?
 but it &apos;s a different reason for me .
 i am still single in mid 30s now cos i dont want to raise a family in a singapore environment and send my kids to school where they will get brainwash by leeducation system for 9 years from pri 1 to sec 4 .
 when i looked at my friends and their family livestyles here in singapore ,  i just cant imagine i do any of that .
 i am still hopelessly waiting to get job overseas to fark off from here 
 drop from the sky oso will run away from them one .
 i tell chiu from i observe ,  those making advance to others sinkie gals are seem as creep/metoo/molest/advantage ,  when angmo make advance to spg is called dating .
 philippines ok for chiu sir ?
 sigma male mentality .
 go on dating alls and fuck all the girls
 might as well watch the ring over and over ,  maybe got chance your gf crawl out from tv .
 no money no honey
 what is your point ?
 why u huanlo singles remain single ?
 wouldnt less competition give chiu advantage ?
 i watching ju-on the grudge now
 try oredi then what ?
 it called practical
 did your dad ask chiu to deny chiu cheated ?
 trying to test the evidence with hypothesis ?
 sounds like chiu are the clueless one here .
 think dad told child to cum clean .
 but never specify a timeline .
 so child though it meant her lifetime .
 and told teacher that her dad told her to take secret to grave .
 people talk apple u talk orange
 and ahtc not oni have no effect on wp ,  but strengthens them .
 even winning a second grc .
 which makes me wonder why other opposition parties cannot even win a single seat .
 omg today i kena called back again to give my side of the story .
 this thread is not simpur  .
 i stop reading at your profile pic
 the teacher is doing what they said they never wanted .
 talk is cheap for sure .
 chiu kena recalled by teacher again and insisted your father’s instructions were very clear ,  to act blur if not pressed right ?
 since your father is a member of the school board ,  of course the school must investigate thoroughly make sure he is clean…
 in another not simpur thread
 wow haha this is really funny
 the teacher should be sacked !
 your teacher want to wipe out your whole family ,  not oni your dad .
 is notch simple .
 send the teacher to imh for checking ,  .
 sekali was a former patient there ,  , 
 just let the female teacher bondage your dad .
 happy ending and chiu confirm passed your test .
 singapore oni can dine in max 2 pax .
 they go out enjoy euro football in stadium without mask liao
 are chiu having treatment for your ocd on this subject ?
 stay locked up forever ?
 better to die on your feet  ,  than live on your knees no ?
 pap &apos;s epic fail vaccine strategy (or lack thereof) coming back to bite/pwn us when the rest of the world oredi opening up .
 we sld &apos;ve been easily among first nations out of gate with most of population fully vaccinated ,  yet here we are in mid 2021 still undergoing soft lockdowns and barely being able to catch up with vaccine demand from paltry population
 i hope the 2 pax restrictions stay until end of 2021 .
 can dine out peacefully without all the large noisy families and drunkard ahbengs .
 last time i always feel weird & awkward when dining out alone .
 but now things are better cos wont see all these large noisy groups  .
 when large social gatherings are restricted ,  people tend to go out lesser too .
 easier for me to go out solo .
 less traffic jam and easier to find parking .
 cos angmo got conq cecaland bef ma
 how come the whole world is reopening but not us ?
 % week on week growth rate is plummeting .
 what benefit did we really receive from signing ceca ?
 a few days ago uk delayed lockdown easing from 21 june to 19 july .
 anyway ,  we are going to allow dine-in on 21 jun .
 see how singapore fair .
 a proper resounding defeat for the delta !
 we got the virus first
 landlords and property owners had not reap fully from it by charging these south asian economic refugees super high rental or sell their properties to them high .
 have chiu seen their death rates ?
 almost 10k cases a day with single digit deaths .
 the landlords and shareholders in singapore can’t endure anymore .
 every day they aren’t earning crazy rich ,  they will turn crazy
 thank chiu captain obvious .
 anyone played before ?

 limpeh oso unhappy cause malaysian still happily partying inside till need to mco ,  emco ,  mmco ,  simi mco  .
 they are the root cause of the failing of jb .
 if they 0 case ,  we 0 case then we can mutually cross each other border 
 please crawl back to your village if chiu not happy here .
 the ill sentiment made up by ts is it~ ?
 even if they can go back ,  they oso cant do house visit~ their mco has tighter restriction~ basically it &apos;s just reunion dinner within family members~
 jhk see this ratio 1:3 sure happy one la

 those able to work here enjoy 1:3 better cherish these moments
 not happy can go back

 they are not trap .
 they got the option to go back .
 u dont stir la cb .
 will u let her eat your toufu and have nightmares later or risk promotion later ?
 in the wise words of biker forum : close eyes and let it go  .
 1) cover the face .
 let her femdom moi
 if chiu want to get anywhere with your job .
 chiu have to let yourself be her dessert
 u decide if chiu wan to drive grab or send food .
 let her eat loh .
 if she wants chiu to lick ,  chiu might want to lick her too .
 helps in your career progression .
 then next time order extra tofu for her ?
 chiu should imagine she is jav auntie type so notch have ed
 close your eyes and think of your future
 dontch want hear ts complains cannot getch promotion if hiam this golden chance .
 better pay me alot until dunnid work
 i will be her breakfast ,  lunch ,  high tea ,  dinner ,  dessert and supper
 ask for a raise in pay if not what the point .
 that’s true ,  have to bear with the sexual harassment in silence otherwise have to leave and find another job
 just spend more time with them now .
 dont wait till they move on then chiu wayang at the ceremony and after that .
 that is what i told my mum .
 then huai chiu moved out ?
 one parent gone .
 chiu should build your own life / family and give your parents some joy before they depart .
 dont be selfish and think for yourself only
 to preempt silbings kick me out .
 i visit daily  .
 start by doubling the allowance chiu give to them ,  if chiu even do give any .
 i am almost 40 and singles .
 even 40yo singles dinobus oso hiam me .
 i cannot fulfill my mother &apos;s wish of see me married and have my own children .
 buy her more good food .
 keep her company .
 bring her overseas if possible .
 every night i lay in bed alone ,  thinking how do i live out my remaining life alone .
 on the contrary ,  i’ve mentally prepared my folks and loved ones of my demise .
 they have to get use to life without me .
 dying is inevitable .
 the joke will be on me should i be the last one standing .
 chiu can talk to your married friend .
 dont be surprised that every one of them is envying chiu .
 chiu can be married and be still alone .
 the story of my life… ,  ,  .
 feel chiu too mate… .
 i oso get that kind of thoughts too .
 well at least u r not 40 yet .
 things always work out fine .
 be single and happy rather than married but miserable .
 have kids wife husband oso have much to worry with life in singapore tougher by day .
 it &apos;s cos u staying with them .
 thats y u feel this way .
 last time moi stayed with moi mum and got many old neighbours .
 all staying by themselves as their children married and left .
 soon the weaker partner will uplorry .
 left the stronger partner who will display signs of distress even though they try to be strong .
 a few years later ,  the stronger partner will usually uplorry .
 but of course ,  there are exceptions where the stronger partner found new interests (e .
 part time job ,  hobbies or community participation) and continue to live long fruitful life .
 i oso worry about my parents leaving me but there’s nothing we can do  .
 treasure them while they are alive ,  treat them well ,  bring them eat good food ,  used to bring them overseas(but now there’s covid) .
 take some videos of them .
 walan late night emo
 take care stay strong .
 did yr dad ask u to bring yr cheating to your grave ?
 i cheated exam alot of times but when i told my teacher it &apos;s my dad fault for asking me to take it to the grave the teacher chose to believe me .
 very grateful to the teacher for trusting my words even though i am a serial cheater .
 your whole village shud sack the teacher for being biased to the max and let her know that karma is a bitch .
 since chiu cant change father ,  can oni change school
 if the son is a serial cheater and liar ,  naturally many people will blame the parents for not bringing up the son properly .
 we zero case then open up
 zero case policy .
 test test test test
 do chiu cower in fear under your blanket everyday ?
 pappies missed a big big opportunity to put singapore on world map .
 instead we even had to cancel the world economic forum and shangri la dialog .
 all cos of the slow reaction to stem the flights from ceca land .
 another expert report ?
 stop creating multiple nicks and waste people’s time .
 is this even an established medical condition ?
 there is zero scientific proof of long covid .
 but as long as it fits your narrative i guess .
 even without vaccines ,  death oni came to the very old and people with other major illnessss/fat and unhealthy .
 now we have an added protection of vaccines ,  chiu still over here painting a gloomy picture every single day .
 once again angmos take the lead .
 no dining out but malls still very crowded ,  so when 2 pax dine-in ,  dont think there will be much difference
 delhi bank of cecapore double charge customers lor .
  help us appreciate the value of money .
 stop acting like a wuss and waste people’s time .
 exactly ,  there shouldn’t be any distinction .
 especially as a pm ,  all the more ,  should put country above self .
 marine parade no drama but they did make macpherson nsp fella lose deposit .
 that speaks volumes of wp popularity .
 pap ib spotted ,  drain on country resources
 dont chiu realise that shan oni take on debates with a legal angle in parliament ,  and then do strawman attacks and like to subtly degrade opposition .
 like how he comment that sylvia was perhaps a substandard lawyer .
 they lost to kate spade and never dare to go back again .
 liddat call popular ah ?
 after barging to get into mparade ,  wp got 35% in 2015 when nsp earlier got 43% .
  liddat call popular ah .
 rebut wp is ib la .
 your nick does not even show any effort thinking up .
 just a scrambling of alphabets .
 who is the ib sia ?
 the hero we need and dont deserve
 all these not important .
 important is many jobless or underpaid with high cost of living under current party  .
 & they pay themselves high .
 lt can talk more than 10 wp mp .
 but he can do oni 1/10 of what the wp mp can do .
 2014 gerald spoken on ceca .
 now 2020 with 10 wp mp , did wp do a follow through ?
 it seem to me wp has forgotten about it or maybe now they give support to ceca .
 at least i know psp spoken on this
 csj oredi mellowed down .
 but ,  he can still be emotional if he is triggered .
 i guess no one dare to take on him one to one .
 so ,  it seems that lky was misled (by who ?
 ) into thinking that oxley has been gazetted ,  so much so that lky asked his lawyer kkl about it and the latter has to check the gazette at least twice .
 the oni consistent parties in the entire fiasco is obviously lwl and lhy ,  who echoed lky &apos;s wish for demolition and not for the house to be preserved like a  &apos;lky shrine/heritage &apos; .
 the last damning evidence obviously is kkl handwritten notes  &apos;free rein &apos; and  &apos;handle the cabinet &apos; .
 we have a political strongman dynasty like north korea !
 thats what trump said  to fatty kim the 3rd ,  that he can rule with iron fist and still be successful like singapore !
 but sadly ,  i think both will end badly .
 i am not against wp .
 i am just a sinkie who believes that wp should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny and criticism that pap and other opposition parties get .
 this is in contrast to the wp ibs/fanboys who believe that wp/jamus/pritam singh are beyond reproach and should not be criticised .
 one word of criticism of their idols and chiu will see them coming out like a dustbin that has been sprayed insecticide .
 bb will be under a grc in 2025 .
 that is why ah mu dont even bothered to put in any effort in his town .
 i dunno how csj will feel if that happens .
 he should know it since there will be some one telling him .
 still want to waste his time on the peasants  ?
 wp style of doing things u still dunno meh .
 bring up an important issue just once in parliament .
 put in online on social media and show that they got do work .
 collect salary while their fanboys go gaga .
 he do this to show that he has commitment etc and to rehab his image .
 so if bb is put under grc ,  he can either contest in that grc or go nearby smes .
 love him or hate him ,  he is still doing the shouting and dirty work for the residents whether it is effective or not .
 i have nothing against him .
 admire his standing up for his ideals cos i have no balls to do it myself .
 good luck to him in 2025 .
 if my child is daughter ,  forget it  .
 i know more girls who found love during university and marry after graduate ,  end up never work or work jobs oni and not career .
 parents see nothing .
 yeah we shouldn &apos;t expect children to chip in but if i have to sell house ,  i expect some reimbursement
 i got one yelam friend go wuhan tongji university to study medicine .
 really have good sexperience about wuhan
 this guy is a good example of having char siew dotter .
 this steel must contract ?
 don’t pay back with interest they will get strike by lightning when they ghost out 
 your char siew kids will happily go study then stay to work overseas never to come back .
 maybe disown chiu too ,  lol .
 which good kid will even bear their parents to sell house so they can study .
 send him for tuition now !
 more come back oredi dont care parents .
 parents apply the maintenance order through court ,  then every month pay 500 .
 char siew all the same .
 this is shittypore ,  everything must black and white .
 some kids even with tuition oso cmi
 i will write to straights times to shame them 
 can don’t sexpose me mah ?
 boomer mentality to treat children as investment
 nowadays ,  all char siew mentality is parents responsibility to give them the best but there is no need to give anything back .
 even shame them oso no use .
 go overseas practise better .
 someplaces basic gp all handled by governement through taxes or private insurance .
 so business is good
 if local uni ,  use parents cpf first better .
 if parents working ,  can take bank loan instead of sell house
 no point ,  it doesnt qurrentee the return .
 most importantly your kid must be interested and good in this field .
 i would not sell my flat to finance my kid to overseas medical course .
 it is a plain stupidity .
 where would i stay without a roof over my head ?
 long term camping at east coast ?
 i think last time ,  many of uni friends oso use the parents’ cpf first .
 after they graduate and start working ,  they will return the cpf by monthly instalment over a period of years .
 this way ,  for the average income family ,  parents’ retirement money is protected .
 anyway ,  even without scholarship ,  the tuition fee at local uni is still affordable .
 many said pre-school years are the most expensive .
 that is oni his side job .
 he got a full time job .
 provided your kids are not yolo and can pass medical course .
 and after pass oso dont be a scum troll in forum that might cause his license to be revoked .
 crazy idea to treat kid education as investment ,  and even crazier to sell the house for it .
 what if the kid strawberry cannot adjust to overseas environment or cannot tahan the medicine school stress and drop out ?
 then liddat if sell house liao ,  is whole family go camping at park drink west north wind .
 so today went to the bank to do some transactions .
 then go to toto outlets to collect my winnings .
 then proceed to hawker center to eat my chyepng .
 hope chiu guys are enjoying your tgif too .
 as usual sinkie men are blamed and shamed for notch going after sinkie women .
 how about shaming sinkie women for notch offering themselves to sinkie men ?
 cannot expect men to do everything ,  right ?
 this is human nature
 yup chiu are very right 
 when ask for jobs and salary > gender equality .
 when dating > human nature  .
 moi think many guys oso gotch unrealistic criteria not oni girls ,  see all the kym treads all want chio and dua liap but never look at mirror see they rich handsome and tall or not .
 it goes both ways everybody wants the best if they settle for average girls maybe not even dino bu still got chance
 most just want the full package  .
 even if the opp person has fairly good looks .
 dnbs = auto reject  .
 but tbf ,  dont just blame the guys totally ,  the opp gender could be of  a choosy lot themselves :/
 what constitutes try ?
 do chiu know besides work and school most couples these days meet via dating apps ?
 what is dating apps but for rich and handsome men (actually ,  tall is even more important) ?
 those who settled in hdb - how many are true love ?
 on the other hand ,  it &apos;s not uncommon for rich/tall/handsome dudes to snag multiple women .
 for the average guy - how many do chiu notice submit to their wives and are super henpecked ?
 unfortunately ,  i personally havent observed very good stories .
 chiu might even say i lost trust in women after quite a few personal experience .
 from my personal experience ,  good women are really rare .
 guys who remain single are smart .
 no need to be bothered with wives and wives &apos; families
 everybody is just tired of each other ,  both men and women
 i giam gana wont sign up match-making package .
 but one of my friend signed up a .
 he told me like throw money to the drain liao .
 might as well invest into alibaba 
 ts really put on his rose tinted glass .
 women are every bit human .
 they desire beautiful spouses too .
 they would like a comfortable life too .
 of course sometimes they do assess the overall package as well
 i wont say such thing .
 i able to find my inner peace when im alone ,  hence i rather remain single .
 i never go find so i single lor .
 bbfa is not a choice
 what are chiu doing to get a job overseas ?
 the oni time i find girls (got to say mainly sinkie bus) may take initiative is when guys they chat with stop taking initiative to continue the chat with them and sometimes their initiative is to start or resume chat with another guy .
 and they oni initiate to trigger a conversation not genuinely to know chiu more .
 after triggering the start ,  they again oni reply with answers instead of having conversation .
 isnt that why most conversations are deemed boring ?
 cos they didnt actively participate .
 such a one sided get to know session genuine guys wont be interested .
 why does it have to be oni them putting in effort and girls just start triggers mainly ?
 just move to the next one la .
 when ts say guys dont try .
  ,  its likely most prefer to try with girls who try .
 oni want guys to entertain them mainly chiu wont be surprised such guys who are willing to do so may well oso be the one who pump and dump and repeat .
 oni one sided effort so take the reward and ciao lor .
 they want such guys ?
 lol oh ya i bet they do after reading the wlh episode .
 there is really nothing much for us bbfa to gain in relationship .
 break up oso won’t get alimony or 50 percent  .
 #hardtruth is they are stingy ,  dont want to pay $2k
 not happy fark them back and dont come again .
 nothing to be unhappy .
 it &apos;s their choice .
 if cny celebration is more important than earning sgd ,  then they can balek kampong mah .
 did we force them to stay back ?
 hard truth what .
 why so headbutt here  ?
 maybe the 1:3 will cheer them up
 just have to be patient somehow 
 they chose the lion dollar .
 they can go back leh  .
 just not essential enough to be granted back in
 they should be happy they not back .
 might kena covid up lorry
 they can explore our local foods .
 like katong laksa and chendol !
 look jin happy to moi 
 unhappy with singapore or unhappy in singapore ?
 either way they can choose to leave ,  no one is forcing them to stay !
 this year for once ,  d1 of cny so many eateries are open .
 thanks to the malaysians stucked here and willing to work on d1 of cny .
 we sinkies really appreciate chiu all !
 give u all a big hug !
 why excusitive to them .
 those came from cheena ,  hong kong ,  india ,  and etc .
 they oso every few then go back .
 why leave the family for money if your family is so important ?
 to be honest some of the job jhk holding is oso not consider die die need them .
 moreover there is so many unemployment in singapore due to covid .
 instead of solving their financial problem using our resources at the same time piling up our social issues .
 why not ask them to go back to msia and drive their own economy  ?
 no one force them to come earn sgd .
 if chiu cant handle me at my worst ,  then chiu sure as hell dont deserve me at my best .
 hardwarezone forums app
 they planned out their activity liao .

 sacrifice yourself for a better future
 i will lie in bed close my eyes and let her gam my lanjiao
 depends on chiu liao
 heng moi boss is well maintained milf

 difficult question  .
 see how the moment come then think
 secretly take video and use it for future promotions .
 ask her who she pump and record down as evidence .
 say covid is here ma &apos;am ,  pass sia oki  .
 got run lion card ?
 got awol and go db card ?
 or shoot sergeant shoot officer card ?
 got him wearing green helmet ?
 where &apos;s the potong jalan card ?
 is there a spell card called purple light .
 in the valley .
 look a bit like jamie yeo
 yes ,  i can confirm
 on the contrary  ,  i feel one should .
 not get married and have kids just cos “you want to give your parents joy” if that’s what chiu are referring to .
 divorce is on the rise  ,  don’t be part of that statistics .
 get with the times  ,  this is no longer the 1950s ,  brides are no longer virgins when they get married .
 most important is dont just think about them leaving .
 take action now
 i come in and laugh at ts
 same  with so many uncertainty right now
 sorry to hear that .
 do take good care of the oldies
 sorry to about your situation .
 take care and best wishes to chiu ,  all the best !
 having pretty waifu who love chiu is the best !
 life is short ,  ts .
 nth last forever
 i oso scared to think about my parents passing  .
 who’s going to give me money when they not around ?
 we all die one day .
 do what chiu can now to create good and memorable memories with them so that chiu can look back with no regrets .
 life is uncertain ,  death is certain .
 things and people around us are impermanent .
 what we can do now is live in the present as best as we can .
 dont give the parents trouble ,  give them happiness and comfort .
 and ,  we may depart earlier than them  .
 chiu are right ,  got to agree with chiu on this .
 marriage life has too many things to take care of and responsibility for it .
  esp on daily issues for bills to pay ,  food to buy for family ,  taking care for kids and their eduation and everyday stuffs .
 constant increase of inflation has oso making every married couples struggling so hard to cope with living costs .
 and chiu dont see any hopes on any improvement in life at all ,  still ,  has to keep worrying for your jobs and retirement .
 life is too tiring sometimes .
 ask your parent sponsor 10k to buy a wife like kurt tay
 i meditate on this fact every other day and constantly remind and prepare myself that it will end ,  i will end .
 feel the emotion arising and let it go .
 bro got try date amdl ,  atb ,  siam bu ,  vietbu ,  jhk bu (before corrupted with materials) ?
 legends said the foreign bu likening singkie like tony leong with big kukujiao and fat wallet .
 maybe try see and got chance .
 that’s why as we age  ,  personal time is so precious with love ones .
 but towkay here demands total job commitments 24x7 until uplorry…
 retirement age extended oredi .
 slowly walk to office ok  ?
 did chiu plan to buy condo like me ?
  i am oredi 44 .
 30+ oni can chiu name the reason chiu cannot get together with anyone ?
 cannot change but can spend more time sitting on bed to daydream ?
 they just need to compare with their current situation in malaysia will know why it is necessary .
 i never see thread making noise on currency exchange rate  !
 where do chiu get the information saying they’re not happy in/with singapore ?
 really don’t see a point of this post smh
 bro it’s all about hoping to get a better life for their families .
 yes they do have a choice — which is why they chose to stay in singapore to keep their jobs and be apart from their families !
 if they don’t care about providing a better life for their families ,  they wouldn’t be in this situation .
 at least chiu get to keep your job and be with your family on such festive period while they can’t have the luxury .
 so just be more empathetic to the foreigners or leave them alone .
 be it malaysians or other nationalities ,  we do whatever we can to improve our quality of life isn’t it ?
 i just think people are so judgy about malaysians coming in to singapore to earn dollars ,  but is it an easy road for them ?
 they unhappy cos cant go back to beo chio jhb sibo ?
 just fark back to their country la .
 no one owes them a living .
 if they chose to stay here and earn 1:3 then dont jjww .
 i don’t think anyone gives a damn of what chiu think bro .
 it’s cny leave some good deeds by leaving them alone man .
 don’t just use the majority by assuming every single one of them behaves that way .
 people could easily say we sinkies are selfish ,  but are we all ?
 what sort of warped logic is this ?
 no one forced them to crawl over here like beggers .
 how can they be unhappy about this ?
 they are always free to leave ,  they know where the door is .
 of course ,  there are ones with brains who are actually grateful that they have a job and place here unlike those haters .
 agreeee with chiu 100%
 they can go back .
 just come back in they want pay for shn or not .
 i oso dont think i give a damn what others think  ,  bro   !
 i will not change of my opinion on them .
 nothing to do whether sporean selfish and we welcome anyone except those ungrateful bunch of people and i referring to jiu hu sai here .
 nobody said they cannot go back .
 they can apply to go back .
 but they ownself dont wanna go back
 moi jhk neighbird working at sengsiong jin happy stay here
 my malaysian friends are happy that singapore  gahment give them a place here so their income can take care family back home .
 even they cannot go back malaysia now but watching this family eating abalone or lobster at home is a blessing .
 please stop posting meaningless fake news here .
 these malaysians unhappy here in singapore should just leave !
 have some backbone and leave ,  frankly ,  singapore do not need and do not want chiu !
 the price of wanting to earn 3 times the salary ,  everything in life have a price to paid for .
 how do u service that ?
 i do believe kkl knows .
 waiting for her to tell what she knows .
 in order to execute what ah gong wanted .
 we are talking about lim tean ,  and chiu appeared to be talking about him in your first two sentences .
 after that ,  the name csj popped up .
 pap ib losing the plot like little pink wumaos .
 those two had not been put on the witness stand before ,  or yet .
 chiu are just making an assertion about their consistency .
   and chiu seemed to forget ,  or chiu didnt know that lhy said that as long as he was not on oath ,  he could .
 for the sake of lky ,  for the respect most people have for him ,  people do not wish to see lwl and lhy grilled in court .
  this is oso the reason why most people are silent about them ,  not wanting to say too much .
 i can oni say  &apos;most people &apos; cos during the last ge ,  there were people who did not hesitate to tell lhy off .
  i suppose respect for lky is one thing ,  but it has its limits .
 not when they believe that the dishonorable ones are his two younger children .
 seems like the smelly chao oppies ib are losing the plot and have to make wild assertions .
  what a low cheap thrill .
 wow this sound like someone we oredi have in our gahment haha .
 pap ib works on sundays too .
 if no one engages them ,  will they get paid ?
 when no one engages them ,  they circle jerk themselves .
 this lim tean is very brave or dumb .
 either way ,  he did help sinkies find more clarity over mr lee kuan yew &apos;s last will and oso despicable things that were done to an old and later dead man .
 lky oso karma .
 everyday say asset enhancement  .
 where is the link .
 oso havent happened yet wanna draw comparisons just to justify wp barging into marine parade and macpherson oni to be chased away by kate spade and co .
 strawman is your teacher ah ?
 1/10 of nothing is still nothing .
 tats sounds just about right .
 leave them alone for they will not hear logic or see reality .
 pray tell how to stop ?
 or u just ignore the fact u need 33% to stop ?
 something that has not happened is truth ?
 all these just to justify wp barging into mparade and macpherson before being chased away by kate spade .
 not say will fail but the benefits are not that great considering the risk is to the male if the marriage fails .
 risk reward ratio isnt very good .
 divorces have been increasing for years .
 seeing other guys kena pawned by wc oso serves as a deterrent lol
 mainly one sided effort in dating and still got to bear huge portion of the risk in marriage .
 such disadvantages serve as a demotivation .
 expired means age > 35 ?
 what are some of the common criteria ?
 moi oso find difficult to find sinkiebu
 cos we watch too much prawn/jav and expect our date to be at least 8/10 .
 nothing wrong with that .
 settle in landed = more true love ?
 chio girls oso can snag multiple guys mah .
 agree that good women are rare ,  but so are good men .
 truly good humans are rare .
 she will post all the bad habits and air the laundry on social media .
 plus all the guy family top to bottom oso drag in … .
 finally demand house … .
 remain bbfa at least got roof over head .
 letch me old uncle share with chiu all .
 there is thish term called  &apos;breadcrumming &apos; .
 it is a baiting tactic where if a guy is stop going after a female ,  the female will send a text or flirt .
 to make her ownself visible to him again and at saem time gib the guy fake impression she has some interest .
 objective is to bait and lure the guy into going after her again .
 remember ,  female will still demand chiu to go after them even if they oredi written chiu off right at the start .
 thish is to con chiu into gibing her material gifts and attention and validation .
 they are smart not to be pwn by wc
 at 36 ,  now trying to find a jod to feed myself first before i find a partner .
 try simi ,  bbfa no hobby ,  no after-work activity ,  all guy friend .
 go nearest mrt start hitting girls ah ?
 1) local girls are not worth the effort .
 2) women charter .
 3) gender equality is just a facade for women to grab the benefits but avoid the responsibility
 depends on the type of gal chiu are trying on and alot of times ,  in very short time chiu know whether can continue to try or move on to next .
 for some gals ,  .
 sinkie guy try - desperate ,  creepy .
 angmo guy try - take initiative ,  goal getter
 i got try uh ,  try liao still fail .
 try dunno how many times
 just another slum
 every day take mrt see those in short pant show their kar mor and wear slipper so slobbish .
 havnt mentioned fair fair skin with a big tummy and their hand smoother than a ladies hand .
 this type u wanna marry them ?
 last resort is go isekai find one liao
 first taim i have to agree w u humjibeng
 chiu are correct ,  humjibeng .
 one must first ask themselves what they want from settling down ?
 as it is a lifelong commitment ,  it must be based on tangible benefits such that the sum of 1ones is greater than 2 .
 oso ask what are chiu bringing to the table to make up the sum .
 it cannot be chiu are full of flaws and want someone who cover these up and then some .
 chiu got chiu mother to do that and she do it cos she didnt swallow .
 at the end of the day what chiu want are just one-offs and does not entice the other party then just use your hands or pay for intimacy then move on .
 the society does not need to support another char siew .
 downtown orders are surging .
 be a delivery partner and get paid .
 anybody sees this ?
 nobody see before ?
 been seeing for past few months
 i guess there &apos;s a silver lining to covid .
 going by their track record ,  this will last 6 months then need another booster ,  assuming colorectal cancer has no variants
 a price i suppose a good number would be willing to pay .
 the effectiveness of this vaccine is oso 6 months oni and need to lifetime subscription to reduce cancer risk from 1 in 4 to 1 in 5 .
 for cancer i would say the risk does outweights benefits .
 this mrna is worth jabbing .
 medicine is overrated in terms of roi imo .
 study finish still have a training phase right ?
 somemore work long hours at the start with relatively low pay .
 its oni if they are able the bear the first few years then maybe things start getting better for them .

 we need foreigners to create new jobs for singaporean
 sinkieland is a utopian paradise .
 can’t imagine how it feels to have 1:3 .
 oni spoilt people will complain .
 no country in the world will allow  &apos;foreigners &apos; to have a chance at work ,  much less a chance at top position ,  with good salary ,  low taxes ,  relatively cheap goods ,  and choice of cheap food .
 sinkieland is the best for foreigners coming in !
 our fault again
 not happy go back lor
 a malaysian couple i know bought 4 houses in malaysia for rent ,  they are happy .

 they simply can choose to f off .
 but they chose sgd instead
 esp covid carriers .

 oso never ban them from going back ,  just ask them pay for the quarantine nia .
 who ask their behkan country handle covid until like that
 they can wave from woodlands
 my cousin‘s msian colleague wanted to bring in msians from his hometown to work in the company .
 my cousin and her sinkie colleagues dont want msian and went to hr and told hr to hire sinkie oni .
 hr eventually hire a sinkie .
 now her msian colleague is happy cos he work from home  in msia .
 before covid ,  every day this jhk came to singapore and back to msia for work .
 why dont they crowdfund for people to pay for their shn ?

 admin should perm ban ts to save 80% of e forumers from getting major depression .
 his depressing vibe he is spreading is of another leber .
 so much self pity and drama .
 actually losing family is maybe like when teenagers drift from best friends niah .
 u can make it seem ultra tragic like tv drama series or u can move on to other things .
 this is inevitable passage of life .
 eventually we too will leave this year .
 life is impermanence .
 the fact so many people get depressed about it or fear it is proof that we have been lying to ourselves and living in some fairy tale .
 death is part of life .
 we all have to face it .
 it will happen to loved ones and ourselves .
 what we need to focus on is to not worry and get upset about small ,  petty things and appreciate the loved ones around chiu .
 cherish and treasure every moment with them
 but sometimes will feel is it i done enough for them .
 can i do much better ,  gve them more or spend more time ?
 cum gege intro vietbu to chiu  ?
 i am more concern if i leave before them and they are all alone
 can understand ts feeling .
 am left with 1 aged parent .
  but ,  i thought that’s one purpose of marriage ,  to leave parents and be joined to spouse .
  just my 2 cents .
 alot of pretenders thinking nobody know truth .
 thats what is so stupid about pretenders .
 if we really so love parents we will not make friends or get married but wanna spend all our time with these seniors liao
 reality is the people who are so close to parents are a rarity ,  like a person with 6 fingers on each hand .
 so wake up and stop pretending .
 treasure them while they are still around .
 ask them to stay healthy by keeping fit .
 don’t worry la .
 u go later is better cos it’s filial .
 maybe some here should have some buddy system just in case … .
 anyway ts what’s yr religion .
 where or what u believe after person is gone
 so every night u think n no answer ?
 lol u forgot to take medication today ?
 err chiu dislike your parents that’s your own problem .
 some people are really bad parents ,  and if so sad for chiu ,  can’t comment on your family history .
 but don’t need to lump everyone else in with chiu .
  getting married and making friends is just part of having your own life .
 love isn’t finite
 ah u must be one of those pretenders who die die cannot be honest .
 chiu are married ?
 no marry  ,  no preggy ,  no wc .
 jordan chan got sing the song before .
 she is a fairy she too pretty .
 buying a flat in slumgol now and hope it comes with a gf !
 if chiu guys have doubt go to the bangkok thread and see how lao ah pei @andy_meow up so many girls and chiu know getting a gf is not difficult
 getting gf is not difficult .
 getting a good life partner is .
 if i want to get a gf ,  i can just go all out and keep talking and making her laugh while she reply close end messages .
 i keep popping new topics and get her number and rinse and repeat .
 its easier than having her initiate .
 tried and got .
 but its tiring i dont want to do one sided effort for a lifetime man .
 1-2 years okie .
 thats why some complain pump and dump .
 chiu dont put in effort and just complain when the guy finally stop putting in effort and say he &apos;s changed ?
 not just sinkie bus .
 all women doing that regardless where they come from .
 dating in social media age give them the ability to next chiu easily as there will be another 20 sweet talker guys that oredi in her inbox .
 have chiu seen your female friend &apos;s dating app inbox ?
 i did and it was insane
 key word ,  lazy in every aspect with the fear of rejection and face loss
 once i saw an ex colleagues message notification coming in non stop the minute she finished creating her profile on dating app .
 and shes average looking at best .
 yes its insane .
 thats why their reality becomes augmented such that even 2/10 suddenly have the mindset of 5/10 or 6/10 .
 hey this is what i suspect .
 cos chiu dont msg one girl in dating app .
 chiu msg 10 at a go
 message every single match .
 guy rich then can buy bto .
 poor people if buy bto .
 while waiting for the bto to build stay where ?
 all these excuses la .
 can rent condo stay onr leh .
 i am almost 40yo and singles .
 even 40yo singles dinobus oso hiam me .
 woah dating app so competitive 
 these girls can take these despo guys .
 despo guys got problem de
 look ard chiu how many rs r genuine and long lasting .
 at the end of the day still back to sq 1 and the cycle repeats .
 being a sinkie male is oredi a face lost .
 rejection is oredi in sinkies blood .
 its just people trying their luck .
 cast the net far and wide ,  at least got better chance to hook one slut up .
 chiu forgot who is the big mouth that say wanna stop blank cheque on national tv hor !
 when he say that ,  oso know will not have 33% hor !
 who are the ones talking to each other to keep post counts up for commission later ?
 wp ib sibei hilarious !
 so we all will patiently wait for more sinkies to be smarter to increase the number of mp from other parties .
 it so happen that this round the west coast  & east coast ,  bt .
 panjang ,  bb ,  marymount ,  jln bersar didnt fall .
  if fall ,  surely wont see u trying to be unreasonable .
 thats y no action talk oni lor ,  nato
 the talk r not empty .
 it ruffles some feathers or expose ignorant or those out to smoke bomb  the whole parliament .
 in between ,  sinkies learn all the various theories ,  fallacies .
 it is all good for moi .
 can jiak popcorn & watch those trying to answer .
 jamus lim big mouth on tv say will stop blank cheques if elected .
 the increase in medishield premium is the biggest blank cheque in this term as it has the effect of draining the medisave of those who are healthy .
  has he said anything ?
 dont come and jjyy about sinkees not being smart .
 other parties not winning etc .
 how come never ask yourself why wp never win marine parade despite barging in during 2015 and gct retirement in 2020 ?
 to date still cannot outperform nsp performance in 2011 .
 take some responsibility la !
 want to take responsibility ,  got to be given ministerial role .
 for an mp role in singapore is just estate management which was the responsibility of hdb ,  ura ,  bca .
 your level is not there yet .
 the responsibility of our covid situation with 60k positive cases is under who ?
 did u see anyone taking responsibility to the families for the lives lost during this period ?
 as usual ,  wp ib point fingers elsewhere to divert attention .
 he promise to stop blank cheque that time oso know will not be minister hor !
 some big mouth says wanna stop blank cheques .
 now got blank cheque he diam diam .
 his fanboys oni know how to divert .
 simi covid la ,  simi be minister la .
 now give them loo which has as much talking time as minister .
 still diam diam .
 so what chiu want ?
 must be god level than can talk is it ?
 boring la chiu .
 nsp performance in marine parade is 43% votes during ge2011  .
 wp performance in marine parade in ge2020 is 42% .
 not too far off right ?
 besides ,  what do u expect with oni 10 wp members in parliament which is not even 30% of the seats ?
 u expect them to perform magic ?
 talk like lim tean/jbj ?
 they can talk like them all day long ,  but nth much will change so long as there isnt sufficient numbers of opp in parliament .
 u wan them to stop blank cheque ?
 y didnt voters vote more opp into parliament during the recent ge ?
 even with west coast and east coast gone to opp ,  its still insufficient .
 excuses liao liao .
 1) still below right ?
 2020 ,  the anchor gct step down still cannot do better than nsp .
 some more in an election where the mood shifted against the incumbent .
 still cannot improve .
 2) stop the excuses of 10 seats oni or 6 seats oni la .
 ownself contest few seats later come and jjyy not enough seats .
 the point is jamus lim the big mouth say he will stop blank cheque if elected .
 not me ,  not chiu .
 he say on national tv hor .
 so now got one big blank cheque with the medishield premium increase ,  did he stop the blank cheque or even say anything ?
 see some people trying so hard to discredit the oni real opposition party that the citizens chose .
 want to ask people to take responsiblityl must oso go accordance to level .
 can misfire wan .
 the buck stops at the top .
 u really just want to cherry pick haizz .
 fai si tong leh gong .
 who is the big mouth that said on national tv he will stop blank cheques if elected ?
 i am not the one whoseh he has to do it .
 is he ownself big mouth one .
 say liao dunnid to be responsible ah ?
 is that what wp supporters think ?
 no wonder can be pap lite .
 bohemiansg has such rabid anti-wp mindset as if wp has destroy his life and family  .
 if any wp talk shiit before ,  we can see pap talk shiit for 100 times .
 rinse and repeat .
 why chiu talk behind my back .
 chiu mean cannot criticise wp ah .
 wp is beyond reproach ah ?
 oni can criticise pap ,  lim tean and csj is it ?
 just tell everyone that wp is beyond criticism and reproach lor .
 cannot answer ah ?
 can see chiu run out of ammo liao .
 i will stop here with chiu .
 it is not as simple as chiu think la .
 chiu think wp should just send 70 candidates to contest just so they can have more seats ?
 chiu are a simpleton .
 it must depend on the quality of the candidates and not contest for the sake of it .
 their reputation will be ruined if they do so .
 and we all know how tough it is for opp to attract good candidates as pap does a very good in fear mongering of political oppositions .
 and we oso have some kumgongs who does nothing but condemn opp candidates saying they dont well  they look weird .
 when these are the ones who at least dare to stand up and do something .
 the least we can do is support and give them a chance !
 horse never eat grass left behind .
 but the grass behind is fresher and tastier
 seldom there case .
 fresher and greener always in front .
 left behind ones are wilted ,  spent and lifeless .
 always charge forward .
 life will be more meaningful .
 dont waste food .
 lick every part of the field
 just move on lah
  there &apos;s a reason why they become your exes right
 move on is easy but connection  with ex is always stronger than new blood
 edmwers dont even have ex in the first place
 she &apos;s a nice girl dont want her to meet a jerk want to look over her continously even if cannot be together
 when its time to move on ,  we move on and dont keep looking back .
 there is a reason why chiu all break up ,  chiu should reflect on that .
 its something both of chiu are lacking .
 which means both of chiu will need to fix that problem ,  or the relationship will not going to work out .
 if chiu dunno what to work on then ,  maybe chiu need to date other people to get more insight into yourself .
 i msg all the time .
 most of the time is the girl dont want to work on it .
 moving on and start afresh is easier for them since no lack of simps
 i usually dont message her ,  she massage me
 recognizing your own short comings is a learned skill ,  bro ,  its easier to blame the other party .
 i dunno chiu well ,  but dont think chiu are perfect either ,  chiu probably dunno whats wrong .
 i think chiu need to reflect on yourself ,  or your next relationship will be a mess too .
 remember chiu used to be a fan of cold treatment ,  do chiu think that was the trigger ?
 call her and ask if she lemeber those time we go that very naise restaurant ?
 just for the restaurant address cos moi forget
 here bbfa where got ex
 what cold treatment ?
 wet market sells like chop robert head .
 sheng siong got sell frozen one .
 but dunno nice anot
 okie i go check it out .
 wkt market really is eat people dont spit out bones one .
 dont mind paying extra but not too much .
 who knows they oso sell frozen one but thaw liao .
 got one member here by the nick poor old guy always go sea fishing one .
 now will be exp if chiu want fresh pomfret
 sometimes they have very good offers for fishes and other seafood .
 everything now is expensive one lah
 fresh wild catch all expensive with roes .
 all cina orang want to eat for heng heng .
 u want cheap can buy those frozen one no roes .
 oso just as nice but not as sweet taste cos no roe .
 song fish got ,  believe ss cs fp oso have .
 used to go jurong fishery market days before cny  .
 need to go around 3 am .
 and buy in bulk .
 like the pomfret is one time buy easily 6 to 8 .
 prawn and sotong buy few kilo
 wont be surprise the popular mkts oso likely to hve surge in queue
 wang lei mai yu ge got sell .
 but dunno the price difference compared to wet market .
 do check out his ecommerce site .
 when i was jobless .
 very fishy smell
 yes s s is promoting and on special offer : s$17 (not sure the weight) .
 28 should be without delivery charges
 that capital comes from our cpf money .
 now they still wanna raise prices on everything ?
 where is the link ?
 i thought they oso lose moneh de ?
 cpf is not temasek
 becuz temashiet gotch investments in faizal vacseens as their cash cow  .
 after how many yrs of quiet losses
 u wanna whack temasick ,  u can whack them .
 but cpf got nothing to do with temasick .
 just cos people know they owe their parents dont mean they love or enjoy being with their parents .
 otherwise bbfa buy a girl gifts means girl must love bbfa ?
 oso bearable does not equal affection .
 seriously ,  u all think people dunno the truth ?
 that is the most baffling part .
 last night i dreamt my mother passed away .
 cannot sleep well after that .
 wake up and surf reddit instead 
 well it’s things liked this that reminds us to b nicer to them .
 don’t raise voice ,  don’t sound irritated etc .
 someone said bring them eat gd foods .
 sometimes gd foods is the unhealthy ones  .
 think they prefer accompany  .
 but is it accompany is always eating n watching tv shows etc together  .
 n hardly asians talk abt heart matters .
 if talk become find gf find wife etc but nothing much beyond these topics ?
 we find it hard to even say thank u for bringing us up etc 
 im not saying u and your parents are not best friends .
 like i said it is rare but not impossible .
 but most people are pretending cos they have been taught what is right and wrong .
 as long as there is pressure ,  people tend to lie .
 as i said that’s for chiu and chiu alone .
 whatever chiu feel towards your parents (indifference ,  hatred) is valid .
 outsiders cannot comment on it cos they won’t know what your family is like .
 of course for some people it’s just a sense of obligation to their parents .
 but for me ,  i love my parents and enjoy their company .
  so yes ,  i can understand how ts feels and i dread the day that they will be gone .
 it’s fine if chiu don’t understand .
 chiu must have given your youth to edmw 
 if u have to remind yourself to be nice to parents means they same as your colleagues and even enemies .
 is this part and parcel of life .
 treat them well now and spend more time with them
 i did not say i do not understand .
 i merely said it rarer than people think .
 and i said most people are pretending .
 if u cannot imagine that then u are in denial .
 like the little bird in your avatar ?
 just cos i cry when watching k drama doesnt mean i really feel for the characters .
 it means the human body can be triggered and we have these emotions waiting to be released regardless of parents or whoever .
 i now living with my elderly mom .
  me n sisters trying to make her life as comfortable as possible  .
 whatever she wants to eat or feel like eating ,  i will go buy for her or order for her .
 whatever she ask ,  we all get for her .
 do chiu have any disability ?
 ah then thats obligation or if u do it for stranger then compassion .
 if gahment provided abundantly for all seniors ,  i am sure less people will even see their old parents .
 just give until chiu feel the pain .
 no regrets if give to parents .
 see some the wife give full attention to the kid .
 the husband like some beta cuc push pram like a zombie .
 mealtime the g0ngkias each on their own phones
 if anything ,  the feelings between parent and child is most pure .
 my point is being married does not mean chiu are not alone .
 why worry the inevitable ?
 just learnt to accept it and embrace it .
 it has beginning and it has end .
 just treasure everyday
 angmo dua liap .
 stinky ah stinky .
 limpeh ask chiu return to school to relearn your engrish

 bayern 2-1 liao

 lewandowski should’ve won the ballon d &apos;or .
 ts stirring sh !
 this is what they are best at and been taught to behave this way since the day they were born
 in before my post from last year
 who gives a fuck .
 ask them go back la
 they’re always very unhappy with us .
 it’s nothing new ok
 according to my tenant ,  they are free to go back .
 just need to bear the cost of shn which adds up to around sgd3k+ for both sides and 28 days of doing nothing .
 in before go back to save my country  
 all the farking jhks should fug off back to mud land for good .
 so some decided to sabo sinkies by refusing to open their stalls 
 some of them their mindset like tiongs ,  macam the whole world is against them and owe them a living by quoting history 
 ask them ghost jiak sai
 home is a causeway away .
 they always go back mah .
 if scare cannot come back then dont come back la .
 they are jiuhu kia .
 they should go back .
 in peace ,  may chiu leave this shore .
 in love ,  may chiu find the next .
 safe passage on your travels ,  until our final journey to the ground .
 may we meet again .
 seriously i really feel sad for them ,  they have their family and kids over there .
 i really hope singapore gahment can just grant them a 1-time off for them to travel back to visit their family without any quarantine ,  maybe just did a covid test and if negative let them go
 3:1 3: 1 3:1 bro which they cant resist
 bet singapore lose for all matches .
 need @scrabby to give tips  .
 who is host nation ?
 we cant beat banana team how to qualify .
 unless we learn from copa america .
 will the cup even proceed ?
 singapore this yr refused to host any afc cup matches ,  causing the entire sea teams to withdraw from afc cup .
 we can beat myanmar ,  but will draw with timor and phillipines and lose to thailand  .
 will fail to advance to the semis based on goal difference  .
 during the interview  ,  we will hear “ good experience and learning process for the boys  augurs well for the future ”
 singapore supposed to be the host but give up due to covid regulations .
 win this lanjiao cup got what use .
 can win prize suzuki swift ?
 still no news on where hosting ?
 hope is home-away format so can watch in stadium
 more like will lose to phillipines and thailand .
 draw with timor .
 myanmar not going to send a team cos their country is in civil war .
 simi lanjiao why bo standard one .
 1 grp 4 and 1 grp 5 .
 still got brunei or timor leste ?
 then might as well throw one into second grp and make it even 2 grps of 5 zzz
 this year tournament will be host in a centralised venue instead of the usual home and away format .
 host country and other detail will be reveal in a few week times
 home-away format more exciting
 dec 21 - suzuki cup new covid cluster
 paiseh miss out laos in group b
 what’s our ranking out of the 11 asean countries ?

 no need to see ,  after 2 games can balek kampong liao

 get a life dude .
 i suggest hardwarezone oso block ts
 knn wtf is this
 it is this kind of cyber bullying that pushes celebrities into depression and suicidal .
 cyber bully sia
 haha why block chiu ?
 proof of bullying ?
 what kind of response is ts expecting  
 dunno who she is
 time to jiak meds ts
 follow ts on ig ,  say thank chiu and post on insta .
 later her bf treat chiu some jh nasi lemak .
 ts recently too stress no time see psychiatrist ?
 is not i think sinkie bu ccb ,  is i think i buay gan .
 humji scare shame and hiam .
 i agree with what chiu said .
 these bitches sit on their asses and expect chiu to initiate ,  entertain ,  and mind read them .
 then when chiu get sick and tired of talking to that piece of meat wall and dump her and move on ,  she will suddenly cry victim claim all men are bad ,  etc .
 who wants a woman to spend money like water ?
 and still flirt with another guy even she is in the relationship ?
 end up the girl let her bf wear green hat
 agree with this .
 the moment chiu run out of things to keep her interested and laughing nonstop ,  she can easily move on to the next profile in her flooded inbox .
 as far as dating apps are concern ,  its a ladies &apos; market out there .
 i tried before and failed miserably until be friends oso dont have .
 dating 2-5 years compared to living together for 40-60 years .
 knn just dont xpect too much n all is gona be guddd ,  its simple so dont complicate it .
 it’s not that we guys don’t try ,  it’s just that we don’t try to headband a wall
 we all wear green hat before   .
 some cut short .
 dating 2-5 years .
 living togethe 2-3 years  .
 i boh tak chek .
 lol ts are u in a sour relationship ?
 why so envious of singles ?
 what &apos;s your plan ?
 buy a wife at 60yo ?
 dont like doing anything with others .
 no rules say foreigner cannot come to this forum  ,  but anyway im pr nia
 pr and foreigner no different .
 end of the day ,  u plan to exit the country after leeching from sg
 my favourite is pearlyn chan one sentence see blood comment
 if there &apos;s anything i learnt ,  netizen voice doesnt matter at all .
 useless mmtf ,  one xiasuay ,  one no time(while people dying already) ,  one say sinkies covid naive ,  the other one kena hrw .
 blank cheque yo
 we have a edmwer here about a few days before moh send him to facility .
 they want your votes ,  not your voice .
 he wants to be next pm ?
 with pofma and fica ,  cannot talk too much liao .
 they oni interested to received celery every month .
 this is what blank cheque feels like .
 just arrest this oyk sua .
 no need explain why .
 he can sleep well with his 6 figure salary while he lets the country crash and burn with covid
 can see our 4th generations ones really not simple
 if we have learn something ,  its that voices on the internet mean nothing .
 these mini$ters are sick ,  got these symptoms:  talking cock ,  self glorification ,  insane appetite for large new cases numbers and lastly treat fellow human beings like digit (lower than a pet dog ,  sheep ,  cow ,  chicken) .
 moh outsource alot of stuff .
 where got people to work when budget oredi paid to others .
 outsourced company staff tell u ,  they are not moh but contractor .
  so who is suppose to do the job .
 this oyk doesnt need money .
 he can risk everything to be pm .
 all these just noise ,  as if he is gonna be affected .
 the oni time they scare is when its voting time
 there is nothing $200 gst vouchers cant fixed during election .
 they dunno how to motivate or inspire people (citizen or people who work for them) .
  just plain top down command dictator style .
 he said got confirmed case but everyday still come out ,  why didnt poh mata ?
 he really jinx .
 now even his moh chatbot gone haywire .
 that simple chatbox cannot handle ,  want to handle country &apos;s health care system !
 they are deaf frogs to all these noise~~   
 moi just dont want to waste a minute of my time for nothing will get into your head since it is so full of what u r so fixed on .
 the public scrutiny on candidates happen to both sides la .
 the ivan whatever oso kena name dragged in mud and had to withdraw .
 the last oppo candidate who had to withdraw cos of public scrutiny was steve chia who has some scandal brought up and sabo-ed cos he was gonna take on wp in a 3-corner fight in macpherson .
 so much for giving oppo a chance .
 ownself dont give other people chance .
 who is a simpleton here ?
 really simpleton chiu .
 arguing for the sake of it .
 and with a lameduck argument too .
 public scrutiny of political candidates oni happened in last ge and with social media .
 for much of the 50 years it has always been opp candidates under the spotlight and intense pap propaganda .
 so much so that it has prevented many quality people from joining opp .
 and chiu still have not answered my question .
 sld wp send 70 candidates just to contest ?
 im sure if they do so we have clowns and pap ib saying that they contest for the sake of it .
 either way cannot win with these idiots .
 i hope chiu are not one of them .
 ownself out of point cannot rebut liao .
 start calling names and insults liao .
 simi simpleton la ,  simi idiots la .
 standard wp ib pattern .
 can chiu all just please go for some skillsfuture class or not .
 dont always run out of things to say ,  throw insults .
 at least try to respond intelligently .
 dont behave like screeching monkeys .
 boring la chiu !
 lol very obvious a simpleton like chiu get called out and exposed but cannot reply so just strawman now and shift to something else .
 what skills future suddenly come out .
 and i did not call chiu an idiot .
 go read again .
 lol chiu are oni an idiot if chiu are one of those who blame opp party for every thing they do .
 so chiu are one of these idiots la ?
 chiu ownself admit i did not say chiu .
 and i just want to state something for a simpleton like chiu .
 i dont care for any party .
 i oni care for singapore and out welfare .
 so any party that can do us good is good for me .
 i hope in time to come chiu can mature and see this too .
 cos wp is the greatest threat to pap .
 im calling a spade a spade ,  as i see it .
 i make it simple for chiu .
 chiu are a simpleton if chiu cannot understand why wp can oni contest with that number if candidates .
 and if chiu continue to argue with lame reasons like ivan lim oso under spotlight ,  which oni happened in last ge ,  then chiu sld leave this quietly lest chiu look more and more like a simpleton
 i notice pap ibs have an mo .
 first they set their targets on a group .
 so in this case is the wp who actually have mps elected into parliament .
 then the ibs will talk up other oppo politicians who were not elected into parliament and claim that wp did nothing and hope that voters can vote wp out .
 i think what they want to see is to get wp weak ,  knowing very well that it would still be difficult for non-wp oppo to get elected ,  thus fufiling the pap ib aim of protecting their masters seats like they did in seng kang .
 notice that attack on jamus lim ?
 it is all scripted one and according to their playbook .
 if they not tired of their own illogical arguments i oso tired .
 oni know how talk s*** and be useless
 whole world simpleton .
 insults ,  name callling .
 what else can wp ib do but be unreasonable .
 1) brag : other oppo sucks cause they lousy .
 see we got 10 seats liao .
 scared or not .
  lim tean and csj dunno anything one la .
 2) act victim: we oni got 10 seats la .
 cannot do much .
 wait until we got more seats ok .
 pap is chao bully cause they got 83 seats .
 3) when 1 and 2 fails .
 throw insult can liao .
 insult people means chiu are right .
 such a big threat that lim tean was excluded from the televised debate and vivian reserved all his firepower at csj while flirting eyes with wp rep .
 lt does not deserve the debate ,  what he needs is a table for him to flip .
 he and m ravi can tag team  .
 that is not what i want to say .
 what i mean is that right now there is no need for wp and non-wp parties to quarrel nor contest the same seats .
 there is no point for the non-wp oppo to attack wp and expect to win seats that way .
 why not just attack pap directly ,  since they now have so many seats ?
 it is illogical to think that if wp drops ,  the other non-wp oppo can just step in easily .
 no ,  it could very well mean the total wipeout that was feared before ge2020 .
 and this is what pap ibs want to create ,  the ulterior motive to cause quarrel between wp and non-wp oppo .
 last year hari raya not phase 2 meh ?
 i recalled it’s oredi phase 2 wor
 hari raya is during cb last year .

 vermin means what ?
 beat beated beateds .
 good gooder goodest .
 created by limpeh .
 todae ,  i &apos;d like to intro a new name to chiu guys .
 parent to child may be natural .
 but child to parent i dont think so .
 such is the inevitability……… .
 treat them well when they are with you…… .
 taking them from granted when one is young .
 oni to find them gone and it’s too late .
 but fret not ,  chiu are not alone ,  when your new generation is there to bring one joy again .
 if chiu are single spend time with them and hopefully oso bring a gal to show them chiu are taken care of .
 if chiu married .
 bring your grandchildren with them with mix cos once they are gone it &apos;s really gone .
 im oso your age range and oso understand how chiu feel .
 my parents are in the 80 &apos;s and i oso got that feeling they will leave me soon .
 cos of ths cb wuhan i cant have more family celebration with my sis family with them .
 still i oso must be glad i have a family trip with them 3~4 years ago .
 my dad  wish is to see stature of sun yat see .
 he took photo with his granddaughter and he treasure that .
 oso to see that and seeing my daughter holding his granny while she walk slowly make my heart really cry .
 anyway still my parents are those zong nan qing nu  .
 my mrs oso say that .
 all symptoms of the most common insanity among people .
 if we have to teach people how to behave or how to treat others including parents then it means it is not naturally occurring .
 means we have had to brainwash people .
 now imagine what would happen if we did not brainwash them .
 no la cos some ple dont understand they meaning of losing love one .
 i oredi lost my elder bro  .
 so i understand that feeling .
 i mean sometime i really hope he was here to f me .
 tell me things which i use to ignore .
 the man utd liverpool rivarly we use to have .
 oh boy can u imagine he is around today .
 im sure he will swan me like never before .
 but still i still hope he was around .
 all i can say is everyone has feelings ,  including your worst enemies and most destructive people and even wild animals .
 just cos u  &apos;enjoy &apos; these feelings dont make them indicative of reality ,  or useful .
 if u think about it ,  our reality is different from that of the vikings and cavemen ,  but our feelings have not changed .
 so do we want to build society based on the wisdom of cavemen ?
 or should we build society on the accumulated knowledge of modern humans ?
 many lost one parent at a much younger age .
 cherish the remaining one
 worry this worry that .
 not oni talking about chiu but so many people .
 some of chiu dont take care of your health ,  dont exercise at all ,  just waiting to die every day like chiu have cancer .
 why dont chiu all just use that time worrying to do something for your parents instead .
 create some good change in their lives .
 but before that ,  chiu better learn how to take care of yourself first .
 then take care of others .
 diseases can be hereditary ,  but many are caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and diet .
 continue being a fool and suffer as chiu age if chiu want to be stubborn .
 then your parents will suffer with chiu .
 spend more time and be nicer to them while they &apos;re still alive
 mum passed away in 2008 , dad passed away in 2012 .
 been living as an adult orphan for close to 10 years .
 maybe that a different mind set u have and i have .
 i just share with ts what i have in mind .
 of cos he is a adult he can or can dont listen oso  .
 i know your mindset as well as that of the masses .
 cos i was a writer for the masses .
 worked in media and advertising .
 i was one of the people shaping your views and taking advantage of them .
 no comment then .
 i am sure they understand those married is not a life of roses either
 repay next life
 u can live out remaining life .
 i know someone in his 50s single and lost both parents .
 but he distract his thoughts by keeping busy
 i guessed it right .
 it is every parents desire to see their chewren get married + have their own chewren .
 cos they want chiu to experience the joy they experienced .
 then they are happy to leave this world .
 i know bec i am a parent myself .
 if chiu truly love your mom and want to fulfill her last wish ,  work very hard at it .
 treat it like an order from your boss .
 no do ,  will get sacked .
 not wait for a girl of your dreams to fall miraculously into your lap .
 it does not happen this way .
 nothing is impossible .
 it is a matter of how much chiu want it .
 prove me wrong .
 what have chiu done in this aspect ?
 did chiu groom yourself ?
 did chiu take counsel from the experienced - i can advise chiu but will chiu accept counsel ?
 do chiu give up after 2 days ?
 why alone when chiu can get a companion ?
 at least chiu mum &apos;s prayer answered .
 no need to have children .
 not cannot go back  .
 is dont want to go back dude
 u see their lanjiao slum the cases how jialat .
 still wanna go back ?
 go back liao risk it and then come here spread the virus ah ?
 how fugging selfish these cb jhks are
 bubble above everything else !
 notch bad liao ,  neber scold back & just block .
 by the way is she someone need to pay attention to ?
 meanwhile the most efficient and highly paid gahment in the world farked up until my family is not allowed to dine out with my parents
 oyk = a disaster on 2 legs .
 all so angry but come 2025 will still vote for them  
 2025 - we are sorry ,  will do better .
 should set new law to jail people with negative social media comments that dont value add .
 no more complains
 at max minister
 jinx really becoming the most hated white minister ever
 when getting deleted ?
 if we ramp up capacity to handle 10k cases daily ,  doesnt that mean that the total hospital staff (doctors ,  nurses ,  admin staff ,  cleaners ,  service support staff etc .
 ) all need to increase by 2x - 3x ?
 is this sustainable from a manpower and financial cost ?
 where do we find so much people ?
 import from india and cheena within one month ?
 instead of fixing the issue when daily cases was < 200 ,  they decided to double down and go for endemic living .
 now it looks like they &apos;re using more paper to cover the fire and they will run out of paper soon while the fire gets bigger all the time .
 jeennoside talked about  &apos;safeguarding &apos; and protecting singaporeans &apos; lives .
 8 innocent elderly died yesterday and 4 were fully vaxxed .
 support riot and uprising to make our voices heard
 sure the comments will be deleted .
 now our front-liner all kena .
 now the ratio patient:nurse  is siao 1 .
 got many din even have time to jiak their meal .
 how to fully care abt those patient .
 really is u die your business .
 miw got their special room for treatment no need worry
 i want to read the rest of the comments
 failed to plan properly but no courage to admit it .
 zero consultation with public on fica .
 how many more cock ups from pap
 mr tame yo virus ,  not looking so hawt yo
 how can infra suddenly ramp up to handle x times ?
  then the question is for how long u can handle x times ?
  1 week ,  1 month or 1 year ?
 mind chiu ,  when increase x times ,  the total number of patients just keep accumulating .
 no wonder lhl cant retire cos his 4g leaders really not ready and very very disappointing !
 but lhl is the one who told people not to wear mask if healthy when pandemic started wor
 arrest everyone in edmw  .
 oso will not be oyk turn loh .
 both too hot tempered .
 always argue towards the end of the r/s .
 too toxic oredi .
 she got princess syndrome and im too chauvinistic not sensitive enough .
 lol third gf should still offer her abalone for chiu leh .
 use your account for various services  !
 if tastier u won’t let go liao what .
 made the decision liao don’t turn back .
 ah boy u how old  ?
 unless u tell me u work in a all guys company ,  no chance to meet new people ,  then i ask u to turn back .
 walan then this kind don turn back .
 too toxic when u old u will regret .
 this kind is obviously personality not compatible
 ya thats why i become a good horse ,  didnt eat turn back grass .
 oredi can foresee if marry sure divorce ,  so didnt wanna self pawn .
 but i grew up and know that i need a more mild tempered and easy going partner .
 whats the reason chiu broke up ?
 the microplastics from her dress is polluting the ocean .
 she should take it off
 geographer or historian ?
 moi looking for apartment to rent now !
 can zeh zeh buy me a house ?
 oredi left 40% still want to split further .
 pull down pap first la ,  split the difference later .
 why dont dare ?
 he got all the publicity and privilege to examine pinky 2 times leh .
 which lawyer can say they done that ?
 which big firm dare to fight when they got so many other cases ?
 after he lose the case ,  change title to  &apos;what a weak in court &apos;
 i think at this point  ,  it &apos;s pointless for oppo to divide due to ideology .
 they should unite towards common goal .
 ideology wont matter until chiu are in power .
 dictator lee understood this .
 this is why chiu see that farker worked with british colonial masters ,  pro-communists at different time and then later he got rid of them all one by one .
 heck ,  he even worked as a  &apos;translator &apos; for imperial japanese .
 oppo can go argue about their ideologies after they got rid of incumbent .
 there &apos;s a time for that ,  but it &apos;s not now .
 when he cried in parliament ,  he could have just buried the sai .
 but anus still itchy ,  go and start another round of suing ,  thinking people wont fight back ,  but she &apos;s wrong ,  now the buried said got dug up stinking the whole place .
 it is quite sad with just 10 oppos inside ,  they r oredi worried .
 do they not have jamus equivalent ?
 perhaps that is what they r afraid .
 since so many got parachuted in instead of a real 1-1 fight .
 disband grc and let sinkies be able to choose the good ones in instead .
 it is now revealed dishonourable son wants to stay in 38 oxley !
 he oredi said that he is not a wp supporter or supporter of any party .
 he oso stated very clearly why wp chose to contest with quality then quantity .
 but here chiu are ignoring whatever he said and just going on blindly on your own .
 did chiu read or are chiu just stupid ?
 dont embarrass yourself anymore please .
 hard to disagree on your statement regarding wp .
 wp ib takes turn liao .
 one lose liao another come in .
 pattern all the same .
 come in throw insults la ,  say chiu stupid la ,  say chiu cannot read la .
 seems like for wp ib ,  can throw insult is a very sakti thing cause whole world oni they know how to insult people online .
 such brave heroes behind keyboard using words that they dont dare to use in real life .
 please can change pattern or not .
 skillsfuture so many courses .
 why dont chiu tell me what it is about ?
 nah  ,  most people plan to root at singapore  ,  just that u singapore people kpkb about gorverment
 how long have u stayed in singapore ?
 going for 8th years
 try liao get one cheespie  .
 nowadays with gender equality ,  women need to start opening their mouths too and not wait on the guys oso .
 women always want simi gender equality but always want the guys to make all the efforts
 woman oni open their mouth when is angmo guy there
 means chiu are not a top tier man .
 if chiu were ,  girls will orbit chiu and will make it overtly clear they are  &apos;into you &apos; .
 to be fair lots of sinkie guys dress sloppily too
 single males are single cos they stopped trying​
 men are realistic .
 i think v easy to say men got negative mentality .
 by 30s i think most average men have some dating experience to knw what will happen de .
 i met this acquaintance last time .
 he do cmb and bumble for 1 yr before he find gf .
 he say he dont aim those same height or taller .
 he say high chance kena hiam for being shortie .
 then his job average ses oni .
 bt can buy hdb .
 he oso scared to swipe those girls tt put manager .
 in his own words .
 he didnt put his profile online to be insulted la .
 men oso got pride de .
 his gf is 5/10 admin executive .
 dating got market economics de .
 quote for truth .
 average men and women both unwilling to face the truth that they dont offer enough to snag a high quality partner .
 but thish is what females no like .
 analogy is a man step into the casino .
 he knows house always wins .
 he is not satisfied with the odds .
 sho he walk away from the table .
 but the dealer no liddat .
 she will find ways to con him back to the table to jiak him .
  &apos;chiu are not brave ,  chiu are not a man &apos; .
  &apos;real man will make the effort .
 be daring and place bets &apos; .
  &apos;not ebrybuddy will lose .
 there are some winners .
  &apos; - the familiar not all women are liddat claim .
 end of the day men need to realize .
 in thish game of life ,  chiu put bets wrongly and  if chiu lose ,  chiu can lose chuir celery ,  chuir house ,  chuir family and be completely wiped out .
 then chiu all ownself think the odds are goot for chiu or notch .
 and whether it &apos;s worth playing at the table or notch .
 1st gal i chase say i stalk her .
 2nd gal i chase say i stalk her .
 i dont dare chase anymore
 i think many males now ,  are so mama well taken care that they lost the alphaness in them .
 heck nowadasy i see the young male .
 wear the shorts oso can fight with girls .
 shorter and shorter  .
 thats why many are attracted to bengs .
 wa i do nothing oso kena shot by ts .
 7-8 years tried to chase so many gals end up oso comes to nothing .
 why should i consider trying ?
 after poly days moi stopped chasing and i am fine with 0 female friend .
 if i were to think like chiu ,  keep want to have female friend and gf will fall into depression instead .
 how would u feel if u wishes to be friend with a female and ghosted chiu when wanting to meet for a meal oni and end up finding her on dating app ?
 do u know how heart breaking it is  ?
 this is what most of us experienced in this forum .
 stop saying we didn’t try .
 we tried ,  and before we attain small step ,  that small step was destroyed by the opposite gender  .
 tell the truth ,  even if u think u are not attractive (looks ,  career etc) ,  still got people interested but it u that got high standards .
 alot of my single friends/relatives all liddat one .
 all reject girl that is interested ,  say  &apos;not my type &apos; .
 and the girls they chase ?
 the gals are like minimum 7/10 when u are a 3 or 4/10 .
 confirm reject la .
 my friend (bbfa) even chase a 9/10 before ,  we all laugh cause even we dont even dare to look at her .
 their fantasy is like movie ,  a pretty next door girl (looks ,  dress and make up like movie star) ,  like a boy for his heart and personality ,  dont care about looks and career .
 got hurt by a playboy and decide to settle for a less but honest guy (them) as if all the handsome ,  successful guys are playboys ,  dishonest ,  cheats ,  loud ,  obnoxious like in the movies .
 but all the girls are watch korean dramas ,  where its the male movie star are handsome ,  young ,   innocent ,  brave ,   chivalrous ,  honest ,  loyal and will do anything for a girl (even if she is petty ,  rude ,  obnoxious ,  older) .
 sometimes u see a bbfa with a pretty gf and u think it can be u .
 or think  &apos;he sure very rich one and the gf is a gold digger &apos;
 i think alot sinkies male have these pre-conceived notion that have to find gf in poly/uni .
 if not in school ,  then when go to work liao ,  must find girls to beo in the company .
 why is this so ?
 is it cos cos closer more frequent contact means higher chance of hooking up ?
 why like not much people talk about hooking up with girls outside their normal range of activities area one ?
 tts why women keep playing reverse psychology ,  say real man will this .
 real man will tt .
 real man will be daring .
 real man will be brave .
   then the beta cuck will ownself think ownself must be 1 2 3 to be  &apos;real man &apos; .
 no such thing as men must make the first move la .
 women is never scared her dream man shy .
 tt he dont make the first move .
 for her dream man ,  all the dating logic go out the window leh .
 the woman will make first move .
 woman will offer to pay .
 woman will plan the dates .
 the woman will literally chase the guy .
 so why they want chiu to be  &apos;daring &apos; and  &apos;brave &apos; like a  &apos;real man &apos;  ?
 women love the attention and validation .
 is in their dna .
 chiu see ig/tiktok chiu knw liao .
 tts why even if the guys are all 5/10 bbfa they oso will take the free attention .
 tt got guys want them .
 whether they wet for him is another question lmaoo .
 lol this is gold
 are birth orphans or charsiews more likely to take their own life ?
 try to get use to it can oredi .
 ts got any siblings ?
 married with kids ?
 dedicate this song to you: .
 chiu about same age as me .

 everything said the ground is angry lol diu .
 next election all vote pap lol or wp as pap lite .
 oyk is the most qualified candidate .
 next chiu see them still complain after 2025 since oyk still get erected
 are chiu dreaming  ?
 i think if he had retired earlier ,  we would not be in this sorry state .
 i think they do not know what they should be doing .
 all they care about is wayang ,  take credit when it’s not theirs and blame sinkies
 if there &apos;s anything i learnt ,  come next election still same result
 who did they vote for  ?
 comments will be deleted .
 no big deal la … .

 dont worry come election time all will be forgotten
 thats what chiu get when chiu hire people without actual working experience
 eh ,  i thought 70% approved this ,  why kao peh now ?
 the one positive n come out liked nobody business … if it’s true then how
 if parliament ceca debate cannot adjourn and discuss till midnight ,  so chiu all better slog oso .
  leadership set the work culture by example .
  civil service oso sets the example ,  sit into some of their hours-long meetings and briefings to their to brass and chiu will know .
 no family life and no making babies ,  here we rely on instant imported adults with education and qualifications all pre-installed .
  slog to beyond 60s to pay your flat and bring up your kids ,  that is the singapore life set up by the pap over the decades .
  after so many years your old age is lived like a peasant drawing from cpf .
  if before that no job chiu will barely make it through the next few months .
  at least now can grab a pink or green uniform .
 ownself clap for ownself lo
 they will normalise the ratio back by asking people dont go to hospital or dont call moh hotline if they are infected xd .

 no report means no cases
 3 in 1 milo and close to expiry cream biscuits .
 jiak mcd and kfc
 soi thai or 7 eleven

 green bean ,  red bean ,  peanut ,  sweet potato ,  bao ,  pizza ,  bread .
 this one think very easy to get ,  she can give u benefits ,  will initate alot after first date n is loyal for life n afterlife .
 but not easy to dump
 zhabor here are waiting for their handsum rich oppa whom they random meet on the street and instantly fell in love with them .
 so why cant bbfa here oso wait for chio rich noona/unnie who will fall down from sky and instantly fell in love with them ?
 single males are single cos they dont wanna be wlhed  
 single is good ,  have partner oso gd .
 considering the potential problems- mental stress ,  emotional worries ,  financial ,  time ,  burden ,  freedom ,  worse if cheating happened which is so common… .
 too much efforts(or lack of it either side oso cant) n people still change .
 single is better n nothing wrong .
 so hard to find a serious one that see eye to eye ,  a good one( must be 1 yourself too ,  can u)  ?
 even if so- people tend to not appreciate n take for granted/ be greedy after  .
 ppl’s value n concept of rs ,  marriage( or life in general) is selfish with higher expectations ,  entitlement ,  blaming ,  easy way out but seldom self reflection
 i don’t see a prob .
 it boils down to 3 words: .
 if u have all 3 ,  it doesn’t matter if u got lower education ,  no $ ,  bbfa ,  no car ,  etc .
 u will still be able to get gfs .
 this is the ultimate truth .
 means just wait for girls to chase .
 cos chase them is waste effort one just giving them free attention .
 i oredi give up liao .
 i man up go chase girls they said i creepy .
 singapore guy or with singapore pr ,  go vietnam ,  get chase by vietnam woman
 nt exactly wait la .
 i think is ok to proactive a bit for girls tt is your standard .
 just dont be unrealistic and chase and  &apos;be a man &apos; for a 8/10 girl when chiu are 5-6/10 .
 the creepy comment is cos they girl see your 5-6/10 too cui for her 8/10 .
 tiagong mostly not the case .
 those kena chase one found out it &apos;s acherly for their money .
 oni one success story from a young friend in his 20s .
 the viet girl paid for his lodging and expenses when he went there for holiday .
 she simp him until he sian .
 well if the lady think your look is 5/10 ,  they will say u r creepy ,  as i got this issue before ,   .
 when i just talk to this girl when she having lunch alone by just pass by ,  the next day hr told me i harassment her ,  end up i win the case as cctv proof everything
 of cos got tried .
  my face really like lanjiao .
  so want to sian pretty one not easy .
 and i dont like fat fat or ugly one oso .
 i feel sad for chiu bro .
 suay to tio this kind of zhabor .
 lucky chiu got cctv .
 if sinkie male must nt strike casual conversation .
 oni angmo can .
 fkn hard truths .
 dont kena more false accusation .
 ya  ,  before that angmo talk to her no issue  ,  really kenasai 1  ,  i leave the company after i win the case  ,  and boss quietly put  &apos;extra &apos; money to me to ask me silence this thing  ,  as the company is top 200 in singapore ,  and i was lucky cause people know how was my attitude in the company as alot defend for me
 ownself fugly but oni go for chio ones so that downstairs can stand and pass down generation .
 so the cctv show angmo talk to her before chiu talk to her ?
 bt oni chiu tio saga ?
 singapore girls really too good life liao .
 liddat oni can say harassment .
 yup  ,  cause i dont have 6/10 look above ,  before that ,  got some girl say my look is creepy for them ,  so ya  ,  singapore women always judge by look ,  now can see why so many singapore women still single at age 50++
 this kind will age badly .
 the boobs will sag .
 the face oso .
 of course no go coffee with her .
 must go easy spring squeeze trigger with her .
 they wont sag becuz they are fake nnp
 piak first tok later .
 piak until 9696 buay lin choo .
 bbfa don’t have wife .
 oso no chance to have coffee with anyone
 singapore girls oredi aging badly ,  when not even hitting 30yrs old .
 no thanks ,  i rather keep my kukujiao safe .
 once i turned 50 i think both parents not around le .
 if around oso close to 90 years old  .
 in my 20s now ,  in 5-6 years moi parents will be 70
 if we can change beliefs as we like ,  how can there be bad ?
 wheres your responsibility as a son ?
 i dont get your point .
 best thing to do for them is let them hug their grandkids
 i seek truth so can build new modern society .
 u seek to feel good based on your belief .
 belief is a variable right ?
 like taleban believe one thing u believe another thing .
 so why would anyone create a belief that ends up in failure ?
 at least we tried .
 if certain people misinterprete the scripture ,  chiu cant blame the religion .
 chiu oso need to look at the rest ,  the main stream believers .
 do i behave like the taleban ?
 i dont think i am one .
 based on my own analysis .
 belief is what people create when situations are not ideal .
 so beliefs make us meet halfway with imperfect situations .
 but if the objective is to create better situations ,  then beliefs will blind u to the possibilities for changes to the situation or reality .
 the oni best option when chiu keep worrying about your parents going off soon before chiu is that chiu need to go off now before them .
 u misunderstood me .
 u ask me whether what u do is good or bad in your belief .
  so i am saying its a silly question as beliefs are man made and changeable .
 so it makes no sense to make up rules that lead to failure .
 why hold on to beliefs when we have the power to change reality ?
 ok pretend i am not talking about your belief but some other person &apos;s different belief ?
 op they brought chiu into this world and showered u with unconditional love .
 if chiu can ,  do whatever u can to demonstrate your gratefulness .
 give them a peace of mind -show them chiu have your life under control ,  give them a comfortable life ,  bring them to visit nice places ,  eat nice food ,  visit their friends with them .
 not expert but think if can ,  find a partner ,  for the companionship and support .
 of course not anyhow .
 but mai-hiam too much .
 just someone who is easy to live with and dont much of have a temper or attitude ,  especially bad spending habit and financial sense .
 afterall human is a social animal .
 like it or not ,  fact that many come online jjww or troll is to seek that support ,  even if some in their own twisted negative way .
 i dont set easy kpis 
 so if edmw is enuff for some ,  who is to say family is necessary at all ?
 have chiu ever ask youself how were chiu created ?
 why are chiu here ?
 and when did u start feeling the need to ask that question ?
 chiu say endemic ,  other countries day chiu are not managing and still ban chiu or force quarantine u .
 end up i think they will be forced to continue with the safe managmenet procedures just to not become an pariah on the international stage
 i see her so sweet .

 all these comments ,  hope they have good memories
 alot of sinkies ranting .
 but come election still tick them .
 on infection numbers that he has thrown around (100~200 ,  3 , 200 etc .
 oyk:  &apos;i speak to epidemiologists ,  doctors all the time; they give me all kinds of numbers; i try to explain things to the public .
 and so ,  some numbers may be picked on .
 but let &apos;s take it in the right spirit .
 im not making any projections or predictions ,  but these are things that i learned from moh and im trying to explain to the public to the best of my abilities .
 finally ,  we now know that he knows nothing .
 previously talk about infection numbers like got dragon got tiger .
 finally now say it &apos;s not projections or predictions .
 then say for fun ar .
 on the subject of hrp for children under 12: .
 oyk:  &apos;i &apos;m not sure if it &apos;s made a default .
 knn ,  as health minister ,  you &apos;re not sure ?

 what i dont understand is how come suddenly in one month can prepare to handle 10k active cases ?
 what have they been doing the past year ?
 from vax injuries problems oredi piling .
 things will oni cascade from there on .
 scary to hear so much unresolved issues that will pile up more and more .
 from the way things are going ,  it &apos;s gonna get worse oni .
 is he waiting for doomsday to come then say ?
 does kpi system really work when running a country ?
 or waste more money ?

 i never use the number linked to my paynow to contact people .
 what kind of business oni need to borrow $400 ?
 not say i want to say .
 $400 oso need to borrow from ah-long ?
 parents ,  siblings ,  friends ,  none can help her with this small amt ?
 law should be passed any loan given out by loanshark will be free to be kept by debtors
 money not legal one so gahment should collect it back .
 oni way to stop their nonsense
 i don’t understand why the victim dare to reveal her bank account info to strangers .
 i don’t even use paylah .
 oni face to face cash transactions if i buy stuff from strangers .
 and those fat or ugly gal can be choosy oso .
 is not reverse psychology .
 it is shaming tactic .
 to coerce and manipulate men into doing what women want .
 yang men need to be aware of these tactics .
 it is to shame and manipulate men to jump through whatever hoops the women and society want chiu to jump through .
 so women and society can jiak the men .
 do the right thing ,  act in chuir ownself best interest and walk away from the people plying these tactics .
 they dont try cos their brains minds have been made hard concrete by culture schooling tradition society in sinkieland
 the reason men  &apos;gib up &apos; is bcoz the women standards are pegged to top 10% ,  top 20% of men .
 no matter how much men do ,  by definition 80% ,  90% of men are oredi condemned to the loser heap .
 but the bright spark is men can choose notch to play thish game .
 and men can impose similar standards on women .
 my climb out from the tv .
 if chiu oni talk to her to be social and she is average looking .
 high chance this kind will be unmarried by 35 .
 bt she quite daring to do this kind of thing leh .
 if everyone same department people will start to be careful of her .
 even if i dont knw her i oso will see her as fuck up character .
 young girl  ,  age around 25  ?

 both sides hiam each other .
 this is just natural selection talking  
 imma got a few close shaves oso .

 if me i oso feel so shiok like i am gods gift to man and the peasants are dafts .
 hope ivory tower is the remaining 1k
 sinkies are not known as the stupidest human race ever for nothing  .
 hence ceca and angmos are running over them
 no head no tail  ,  who is ms ong
 cheating openly ,  all the art not counted ,  no difference from no test no case .
 which rock chiu crawl out of to start this thread ?
 who &apos;s miss ong ?

 ms ong the one who sue sinkie gahment  ?
 if chiu misappropriate 50 million dollars worth of funds  ,  cheating/misusing funds from hundreds thousands of people = 3 1/2 years in jail .
 but if chiu go and rob 7-11 for a few packet of ciggs worth <$100 = 3 years and 12 strokes of cane .
 does the math add up ?
 hammer falls heavier on those at ground level .
 crime does not pay .
 white collar crimes does pay  .
 cos bright future
 did the latter rob using weapon ?
 not a simpur thread .
 dare not comment .
 do chiu get to keep 50m ?
 time mor precious ?
 worth more la .
 news i read alot done by foreigners when it comes to stealing co money n feel that the sentence don’t give strong signal ?
 are chiu talking about brother kong ?
 pofma ts for saying court in unfair
 it pays well to have a good lawyer .
 especially that lawyer has the potential to be a minister
 the elite and the rulings always scare the common people begin to use their fists .
 its always like this .
 run over people even lesser sentence  .
 i never understand laws too
 aready transfer offshore liao 
 victim of the 50m dollar theft was not threatened with bodily harm during the heist right ?
 50million can buy how many pack of cigarettes ?
 not to mention  ,  50m is cheated/misappropriated from how many persons ?
 chiu think the guy deposit 50m into his own personal posb saving account isit ?
 judge can become doctor ?
 everytime ivermectin starts to be used in the treatment protocol ,  the covid cases and fatalities plummet .
 its not oni for indonesia its literally the case worldwide .
 look at india &apos;s covid chart ,  covid cases & fatalties plummet after a certain allegedly useless drug starting with letter i started to be used in treatment protocol in may2021 .
 just a mere coincidence ?
 or is there is more to it ?
 there is some rumor spreading around that where a country signed the deal with the pharma ,  they have to use the vaccine even if another alternative is found it the vaccine found ineffective .
 if not they get sued or something .
 it seems more and more the case .
 based on how they stand by a lousy vaccine - not one peep of criticism - could be true .
 go look at the daily number of cases here and there .
 compare them to population size .
 surprise : ours is worse than theirs .
  more than 2x ,  based on yesterday &apos;s figures ,  according to my calculation .
 what is indonesia &apos;s vaccination rate and which vaccine ?
 did they undergo any lockdown ?
 or no test no case ?
 what do these care packages contain ?
 world war 3 liao .
 blessing is when family &apos;s ancestor die ,  grandparents die ,  parents die ,  sibbling & chiu die ,  sons & dotters die and grandchildren dies - in this order and sequence .
 everybody will die one day ,  best when death is in proper sequence .
 think some the behaviour the attitude says otherwise bah .
 some seems come with alot of resentments .
 and think there is a big difference between imaginary and the real thing .
 some may often jjww dont like to have family cause conflicts and such when people too many .
 but they often oni see the negative .
 differences are oni but part and parcel of life .
 there are oso quite many happy moments when with others .
 when got others help and support .
 think often how the family turn out alot is how people make it out to be .
 many often like to look toward others for blame ,  but dont really reflect much upon themselves .
 those more aloof ,  single child and dont really contact much relatives ,  even closed ones ,  may not understand and appreciate family much .
 but think those come from family that is not too dysfunctional ,  got quite some members ,  although on off will have some differences and conflicts ,  but generally as a whole ,  think oso have alot more appreciation for the bigger family and the joy and moments together ,  the companionship and support ,  especially in difficult times or when in need of help .
 if no answer then go search ?
 but if are lazy and think that chiu have the power to change your life ,  go ahead .
 but chiu will know the truth when your soul will be taken out on your death bed .
 there we have it .
 the extent of your brain power limited by beliefs .
 or the other way round ,  limited brain power leads to beliefs .
 we were discussing halfway and u suddenly end up hating and pretend laughing .
 i was right all along .
 beliefs are dangerous .
 why they hiam u
 thought of buried or cremated ?
 whose poem did ts copied from
 why sun yat see resting in tw ,  it should be in china
 u jin chek ark such kpi what if one of them is infertile due to incident
 then they have to know i am displeased that they have failed me .
 how else do chiu force kids to do my bidding ?
 these days ,  got advance medical solutions to solve infertility .
 just a matter of want or dont want .
 i told them openly .
 i never ask them be doctor lawyer banker .
 i oni want them to taste happiness .
 in my honest opinion - and i am entitled to my opinion - is to build a family of their own .
 then i know i am released from my duties to them .
 i can leave this world .
 my apology if chiu felt hurt .
 think chiu misunderstood me .
 i dont hate or pretend laughing .
 chiu look at my previous post .
 more often than not i post with a laugh .
 instead of red angry face .
 i laughed when u mentioned chiu have the power to change .
 we are still friends .
 islam will always be a misunderstood religion and i dont blame anyone for their ignorance .
 i was like chiu once upon a time .
 beliefs are dangerous oni to those who dont read up and do research instead of relying on social media oni .
 beliefs are dangerous when there is a growing world of other information and knowledge but people choose to ignore them .
 i dont care if u are into one religion or another .
 its all the same to me cos they share the same ignorance .
 the very reason it is called religion is cos it does not have the same usefulness as science .
 u dont see people build planes ,  bridges or medicine with religious teachings .
 in fact u dont see anything at all built from religious teachings .
 why do u think subjects like psychology ,  anthropology ,  economics and sociology are studied in uni if religious teachings were useful ?
 its oni function is escapism at best like netflix and masturbation .
 where it gets dangerous is when these people judge and hurt others based on its ridiculous teachings .
 that is huat life is .
 i still remember a number of people from kindergarten till uni .
 some were really good friends and pals at some point ,  but eventually the path will diverge and left the life of each other .
 some remained in contact ,  some less so and become more involved in their personal family .
 the point is ,  people come and gosh in life ,  it is inevitable .
 dwelling too deeply into the meaning of loss and gain of relationship is just a form of relentless self torture .
 just cherish the present and those around chiu and understand that eventually there will be a time to let go ,  and the people will have to seek their own path forward in life .
 religion is more for mental health la .
 most people are weak mentally to some extend  ,  u see the number of smokers n drinkers around u .
 religion can help them find strenght to carry on life and push through tuff stages of grief  ,  to lead a meaningful moral life ,  when otherwise ,  they will fall into temptations etc etc .
 walan ,  it is time for chiu to move out and be independent liao .
 then what is psychology for ?
 u think everyone boh diaji go visit and quote psychologist  .
 my psychologist say cannot eat pork cos dirty  ?
 cannot piak outside marriage  ?
  my dad died and he is suffering in hell  ?
  feeling guilty cos masterbate everyday and  pay $10000 a hour to go tell psychologist ?
 no  ,  they go visit their pastor to confess  ,  go temple ask gym or visit their inman cos its free yoh .
 get a vietbu to change your destiny
 wa the generation gap damn big .
 like mine ,  so i grew up quite distant from my parents .
 there is 1 truth in this statement .
 show her your dbs shares  .
 ts ,  i suggest chiu camp out at mediacorp building every evening and when she book taxi ,  chiu can faster zoom in to fetch her .
 think of some excuse if she ask how come havent started booking chiu came oredi .
 if chiu really want to know her .
 u will find all ways to know her .
 guess u never listen to yes933 .
 time to listen yes933 .
 and her live program in the radio .
 dm her your dick picture  .
 works pretty well all over the world
 she come in n out by cab de .
 u might want to standby n pass your number to her and u fetch her before and aft work .
 might next time she say how good r u in the air .
 nowadays taxi rental is expensive .
  i oso not willing to drive around due to my vaccination status and how rampant is the omicron in the community .
  im wary of my health .
  this option is not feasible .
 chen ning prettier than her .
 i respect your taste .
 personal taste is subjective .
 i prefer mei gui .
 moi belif chiu inovaqiq ah hia .
 sori sori bw gor gor
 used to think that way ,  but nowadays i find chen ning damn fake ,  and that nose of hers .
 dont understand why kun hua likes her .
 although mei gui is short and jhb ,  i think she is sweeter and probably makes a better gf/wife
 mei gui is a jhb ?
  i thought she is a sinkie ?
 she is jhb and live in bukit batok .
 thank me later
 u 40+ year old still want 20+ year old ,  damn disgusting and pervertic ,  imagine when u 30 yo she was oni 10 .

 hazelle zhut zhut sound will be very loud
 south dung attitude is bad
 well ,  recently i &apos;ve been hearing the long time loyal pioneers say they will not vote p@p the next election .

 unlike keyboard warriorz  .
 including myself perhaps .

 good luck everyone we all gonna get covid sooner or later thanks to this useless miw
 money too good .

 he wlwl oso nvm 
 he is the type that always paint a good picture to the boss  ,  but the person doing it is not him
 then can justify importing more people what… .
 if not come 2025 how ?
 oyk very tua kang indeed .
  i wanna ask him .
 he ask seniors to stay home is for senior good or for his plan to less messed up ?
 if for senior good ,  yes ,  now is surge ,  stay home .
 but he dont think he can ctrl the cases wor or no strict restriction .
 3 mths later ,  the cases will still be there .
 how long oyk want to confine people leh ?
 i not scholar dont have scholar brain
 it takes alot to run a country .
 the fact is this group was kinda rushed in too .
 this is a failure of succession planning .
 in a way i pity them too .
 remember gct himself kpkb about the delay in handing over ?
 wtf was going on  ?
 they had all the bloody time in the world to get a team ready .
 then mia no blame culture .
 was always mia .
 could have handed over to tharman .
 could even have handed over to new ministers years and years ago .
 what happened that side track everything into a rush ?
 become reality tv ?
 the blame lies mainly at the top !
 your favorite cos she looks the most chio with the pink mask on lol
 genius at geno .
 ya lor yes or no style .
 dont give grandma story and explain your difficulties .
 just yes or no .
 their ownself award ownself world-class salaries are not for their world-class performance in handling covid .
 it &apos;s for their world-class thick skin  .
 post a few selective comments to claim oyk under fire .
 sinkies lifes are not important .
 we all die is our own problem .
 nothing to with them .
 they die die want to open economic cos without opening the economic ,  their million dollars paid are at risk .
 their pay is more important than our life .
 i &apos;ve learnt alot from being on this forum .
 so its oni right i contribute as constructively as i can .
 ok la ,  run over oso must see what’s the situation .
 g accidentally or maliciously right ?
 pofma chiu for saying ts say court unfair
 how do u even prove maliciously  .
 can get a good lawyer maybe dont even need to serve jail terms 
 g chiu and colleague/boss/gf have a fight .
 shortly after the fight chiu bang him/her down .
 chiu bang down some random uncle chiu have never ever seen in your entire life .
 use some common sense ,  which one is malicious and worth investigating further ?
 or chiu think there is no difference  ?
 potential to succeed that’s the difference .
 in meritocracy we need to assist and reward those with potential
 cos singapore moving from first world to third world .
 why not ask pap and kong hee  ?
 robbery carries a heavier sentence mar .
 and this type rob cigarettes probably iq not very high .
 agree  ,  probably cos of the weapon involved .
 but think about it .
 most sinkie won’t even earn 1m in their entire life
 truth often lies in the simplest answer ,  not long winded thesis !
 hello there are many accident with negligence and drivers usually get away with a slap of fines and no jail terms  .
 even drink driving accident  ,  if the joker run and hide until next day do test oso cant get accurate results  .
 your example can be better anot  ,  stop watching so much drama la 
 chiu see money heist .
 rob the mint of spain plus pew pew oni jail time .
 as i said ,  the intent of the accident matters .
 your head made of straw isit ?
 chiu take knife stab people and a traffic accident  ,  chiu think both is the same and both should be hanged ?
 which school chiu from ?
 chiu must be illiterate
 confirm u no ceca siah ,  dunno how to do the kek-ling-ah siao maths .
 thats why need to import talent from ceca .
 lousy school of cos 
 it really depends .
 oso took millions
 low ses crime-doers cannot think which crime to commit is more worth it .
 peasant lifestyle contributes to peasant thinking and stupidity .
 cos one didnt use weapons to threaten them and the other not satki enough to con 50m .
 thats why law is a separate major in universities .
 chiu dont see math formulas showing up in legal textbooks .
 mathematics is oso a separate major
 if theres a religion that teaches me to do nothing but pray ,  oni think of  hereafter ,  then i would hesitate accepting such belief .
 its not practical .
 but if my belief teaches me to seek knowledge in this world and at the same time think of hereafter as this is a temporary world ,  i think its a good religion for me .
 cos i know my purpose in life and i know where is my final destination after i kick the bucket .
 by the way just curious .
 since chiu dont believe in religion then hw would your family send chiu off ?
 living and then dying is the beauty of being human
 yobyella bro ,  are u acting cute/funny or are u seriously asking that question ?
 cos i been trying to tell u that u oni fear hell or whatever  cos u believe it in the first place .
 i dont believe so i dont fear .
 instead of solving the fear ,  your belief perpetuates the fear and makes it worse .
 i have no such fear cos i dont have such beliefs .
 u can understand this or not ?
 it doesnt have to be beautiful cos we have no choice haha .
 i have deduced that oni a fearful heart needs to see beauty in what is natural and common .
 then chiu are a very dangerous man  ,  the oni thing binding chiu is spf  .
 and sadly they are not ommipotent .
 fear of a ommipotent being & the consequences is what keeps most people on the straight n narrow  .
 then u saying the law is oni for non religious people ?
 so u saying the most religious countries have lowest crime or they dunnid law ?
  then without taxi meters ,  u think religious taxi drivers say in malaysia will charge honestly ?
 thats cause they are not religious  ,  fake one .
  peer pressure for show nia
 so isnt technology and law more effective than religion ?
 get a small dog or a cat .
 but oni dogs like to go for walks .
  but then ,  if they got sick ,  vet fees may be costly .
 the family dog always looks forward to seeing main carer coming back even after death !
 read the story of this type of dog .
 cos law is up to individual and humans ( pap mp in case of sg)  they will never outlaw smoking or drinking as long as taxes can be gain from it .
 but your local inman can say chiu cannot buy 4d ( gambling ) or drink alcohol   .
 both is bad for chiu .
 guan yin mah can tell chiu to go apply for more jobs ( next week will be better) when u kena reject for 6 months but law cannot tell u to go apply for jobs and stop be a char siew .
 psychologist will not see chiu when u have no jobs and no money
 if u really see technology and human intelligence no up ,  then nothing i can say .
 or we can plan to change social order and society for future generations .
 the suffering oni comes from expectations and inefficient / unsustainable systems .
 please note that the other way round oso happens ,  just notch usually reported cos parents are usually considered to be always  &apos;right &apos; .
 if they are suffering from some kind of disease ,  better let them go !
 i envy singles nowadays ,  now can even buy fully paid up a 2 room flexi ,  low maintenance and canrenovate it up like 1 bedder pte condo .
 once everyone can fly overseas even go genting ,  never stay home liao .
 of course must stay fit - at least aim  target running fitness ,  best if can play music instruments ,  have good hobbies like photography/painting ,  try cooking and baking .
 morality changes with conditions .
 if u have a tech to prevent theft then there will be no thieves .
 if u ban marriage then there will be no adultery .
 if u make taxi use apps like grab then there will be no dishonest taxi driver .
 morality and beliefs are just a temporary rule or deterence implemented oni cos the system isnt fool proof yet .
 if u change system ,  people may try to find loophole ,  then religions or gahment will have to come up with new rules and laws .
 if there is no loophole then there is no use for religion or even laws .
 someone else knows the  feeling
 works both ways .
 it has to be a two way process for things to work out properly .
 auntie wendy kena kicked out by siblings before ?
 ts got taste ,  the other 933 djs look like aliens .
 hazel zeh zeh is kids number 1 as she hosts ch8 sunday show  .
 don’t belittle bw kor kor .
 u know his latest stock purchase cost how much or not
 false sense of invincibility will do them in one day ,  if they live longer enough .
 wa this is on a whole new level liao  
 experts say scared chinatown might form large clusters .
 if chiu notice ,  last round was bukit merah ,  now chinatown ,  all is seniors openly gather de areas 
 regardless of vax or not ,  still must adhere to social distancing and personal hygiene measures  
 vaxxed oredi still scared then vaxx for wat
 they not scare death la !
 either fine them or make them xiasuay print their name and photo big big on wanbao to shame them then they scare .
 those smoking never shower and change clothes unkers oso same !
 seems like it starts to spread again .
 gonna be an interesting week for the reporters
 well the message now is vaccinated dua kee ,  vaccinated means can do this do that ,  non vaccinated keeps dying .
 public just hear vaccinated means they are safe and covid over .
 don’t know who pawn who ,  vaccinated or non vaccinated
 why vaccinated still got clusters ?
 a new narratives are needed .
 waiting for hexjinx to release the explanation .
 yall dont jjww !
 dont blame them .
 many still think vaccination means they are fully protected .
 u know who to  &apos;thank &apos; for this .
 no scared la cos gahment said one what .
 they are the one that declared covid is endemic
 cox the old people thought vaccinated leow all superman .
 all they hear is unvaccinated can protect u from serious illness and maybe death .
 however they 4get 1 thing which can kill them called underlying conditions
 why suddenly so many feel unsecured ,  doubtful ,  fearful ,  troubled .
 what happened to all the confidence for the future; more good years; for chiu with chiu inside you;  always here for chiu .
 they finally realized it was oni a mirage ?
 even old people oso think vaccine is bulletproof .
 wait till they find out the truth
 they are superman .
 on edmw suan and laugh quah zheng wen but ownselves never even go for gold test in swimming before  .
 in ns kena tekan then can’t wait for him to suffer just like bbfa past time
 heng no wife and children  ,  if not pass down 3 high genes other than diabetes  ,  heart disease etc
 then iz a good deal 
 actually the 50m crime affects more life than the 1 robbery so yes ,  the punishment doesnt align with the crime .

 how do chiu explain when the interviewer asks  &apos;why did chiu leave your previous job ?
 say chiu left bcuz too stressful ,  pay not enough ,  shit boss ,  etc .
 seems hard to give a convincing answer .
 later i ask my ex colleague .
 he think anyhow apply will get job .
 now see him play games everyday .
 i said family commitment .
 but i will not resign without a job again .
 really will get lazy as time goes by .
 skmwmore old le .

 then what if they ask why need break ?
 will come across as lazy ?
 left my previous job ,  took a one month break .
 started applying ,  within a week got interview and job offer next day .
 think if they want chiu ,  u give any reason oso can one
 just say u take a break to help with family business .
 very risky move
 usually i say the office is haunted .
 my lan par and lan par ji felt most uncomfortable with the ongoing  haunting
 wth chiu dam heng .
 i still fighting tooth and nail to get an offer .
 yolo is the oni way
 just say that chiu feel the ex-company wasn &apos;t a right fit for chiu .
 throw letter without securing a job before .
 one of the best decision of my life .
 say chiu tio toto .
 now very bored at home .
 want to come back to work .
 then why chiu quit without a job ?
 just tell the interviewer the truth .
 what if they ask chiu why company can tahan haunted office ,  why never hire priests to clean the office or shift office to another place ?
 sometimes ,  chiu just gotta do it  .
 got enuf money tong why not
 say chiu own 20 bitcoin and is oni looking to work for passion .
 there &apos;s no such thing as a stupid dog .

 i think all your effort to gym gone down the drain liao  .
 ts why eat peasant food ?
 satki nus graduates dont eat peasant food hok

 this ts trying to stir shxt again .
 mass report coming for chiu again

 everything belongs to cheena .
 fish oso belong to ccp .
 our education system has failed badly .
 moi tiong corlick no study in sinkieland la .
 but he gotch study maozzzzdong and xijinnnnpi thoughts .
 siam is which country ?
 why stop there got cheekon rice
 cheekon rice from hainan chu dunno ?
 kimchi from cheena cos cheena got paochai ,  sushi oso from cheena cos cheena oso got eat raw fish ,  chicken rice oso from cheena cos it &apos;s got hainan in it ,  nasi lemak oso cheena cos the rice used is from cheena ,  .
 everything we have are all from cheena cos it &apos;s all  &apos;made in china &apos;  .
 precisely poor choice of example .
 might as well use tea too
 love your parents to the fullest .
 once gone ,  forever gone .
 it is inevitable ,  take care of them as best as chiu can till then and start planing for your next phase of life  .
 i &apos;ve decided not to stay in singapore in the long run
 forever jab isn’t a solution
 can i know why chiu are so negative ?
 it &apos;s chiu yourself who do not want to go to vietbu marriage agency to find a life partner .
 then chiu come and kpkb here .
 no one can help chiu here ,  sorry .
 travel around ,  rental ,  and  &apos;passive &apos; income should be sufficient to cover my needs .
 hope the vaccine requirement nonsense will be stopped in the coming years .
 using my free time to brush up on the language(s) ,  oso making overseas friends
 if chiu dont believe in any religion ,  then what going to happen to your ashes ?
 its not about my religion .
 i asked cos i have an old friend .
 his bro passed away .
 during the wake ,  they engaged a taoist monk to perform the ritual .
 by the way not all religion believe in hell .
 i said hell or whatever .
 i dont care lor .
 i mean some westerners think it symbolic to scatter the ashes .
 but i dont even see the value of doing that .
 can flush in toilet for all i care .
 bro how old are u again ?
 u know about other religions yet u cannot see similarities in the silly beliefs ?
 then u believe the chinese who burn paper house and money ?
 u know when our other bros here talk about it they are actually joking and not serious believers right ?
 thats what free thinkers would say that they dont care .
 afterall oredi dead ,  why worry so much .
 kind of hypocrite ,  imo .
 my friend case is just one of the many examples .
 another example when they are in pain/ill and doctor couldnt find any form of sickness ,  they start looking for divine help .
 seen many cases leow .
 not all religion are similar .
 some dont believe in heaven and hell .
 some dont believe in rebirth .
 see chiu did not do your research .
 and chiu start saying all religions are silly .
 diff belief diff practices .
 i respect their beliefs cos my faith told me to respect them .
 most of the bros here whom i had discussed with are serious with their beliefs la .
 aiya u just finding fault with me .
 u think as a chinese i never heard of reincarnation ?
 this is another obvious indicator u dont even want to talk sincerely .
 hey forget it la .
 thats why this problem has never been resolved for ages .
 i can tell u that u oso stick to your religion cos of competition .
 if everyone in the world had same religion as u ,  u would change religion .
 just a friendly discussion .
 no right or wrong cos we are still breathing .
 oni when we breathe the last breath then we will know the truth .
 well maybe u are even wrong about that last sentence .
 who are u to make that statement ?
 what makes u so sure u will learn anything when u die ?
 when u have not in a whole lifetime .
 u think u are some deity or prophet ?
 or maybe more humbly u simply been brainwashed .
 but dont chiu think so ?
 i mean chiu and i say we are right .
 so when we kick the bucket then we will know the truth ,  no ?
 at least i am insured .
 if i am right ,  then chiu chia lat leow .
 i learnt alot fm my belief .
 not so selfish and arrogant .
 more humble than before .
 i know theres reward for me in the hereafter ,  god willing .
 people said i seow lang .
 but when they see something which science cant even prove ,  they keep quiet .
 now let me ask chiu .
 what did science say about human creation ?
 how were they created ?
 sigh i dunno why i bother when u are so insincere .
 but i will try one last time .
 are u saying religion has answered something science has not ?
 science has very high standards of accuracy u know ?
 this is not about me u know bro ?
 u are making this chiu vs science ?
 u sure u so confident ?
 by then singapore occupied by ceca
 singapore is not sustainable and so fake ,  even the garden by bay tree made of stainless steel ,  it &apos;s better singapore merge with bigger country ,  everything here looks like a hard-pressed illusion turned reality
 i &apos;ve decided that there is no point sitting around lamenting about an environment one is powerless to change .
 better to go find one that suits oneself
 say want to endemic .
 then this restriction that restriction .
 need so high meh ?
 1 million liquid asset should be enough .
 i oni need my 4cubs to become president scholars then finish uni get on to work get married breed grandchildren for me to play then i can retire
 correct ,  thats my plan this friday .

 if single no kids still enough .

 means dont retire lor .
 lifelong working is good
 paiseh tomorrow $5m is mine  
 for normal bbfa 1m can liao .
 what more u want oredi quite comfy .
 tio cancer time sell property 2 for medicine money wait die
 assume he live for another 50 years .
 78 for meals daily for the rest of his life .
 i dunno why people here think they can retire with 300k .
 its just completely unrealistic and asinine
 when he wanna retire ?
 how much is his basic salary per month
 got home to stay in and not married can lean retire .
 maybe work part time
 chiu do know that hdb 99 years later become 0 value 
 so far this month all died are unvaxed .
 an impt new narratives starter news pc .
 tomorrow ,  follow up with sm interview an experts: vax oso can get infected; this is going to confuse the hell out of the oldies .
 let them be inside icu then they will learn
 propaganda works like a charm
 no one died locally .
 ignore the rest of the world .
 the data oso appeared to show a waning effectiveness of the pfizer-biontech shot ,  however ,  with the vaccine oni 16% effective against symptomatic infection for those individuals who had two doses of the shot back in january .
 but for people that had received two doses by april ,  the efficacy rate (against symptomatic infection) stood at 79% .
 more danger for oldies ahead .
 israel jan full vax ,  by aug 16% efficacy for symptomatic; asymptomatic much less .
 ask yourselves la  .
 do they look like the kind of people who chiu tell “if chiu take the jabs chiu can still catch corona like anyone else but your chances of falling very ill are lower” and they will be convinced to go ?
 if any of these are unvaccinated and chiu tell them that as of today there are 3 seniors above 60 who are fully vaccinated but are in icu  .
 how many of them do chiu think will still go ?
 before people question what are they thinking ?
 the first question should be what was the message delivered to them to convince them to go get jabbed .
 they oredi took the vaccine ,  so educate them instead of shaming them la 
 they go icu oso cos of underlying conditions .
 not cos of covid .
 why still restrict ?
 endemic ,  new normal ,  we cannot stay closed forever ,  it &apos;s ok to see more cases and more deaths .
 papship coming in soon .
 gahmen say their lives are worth oni $30 !
 so far records show oni unvac will die  .
 so no need to scare .
 vax alrdy 100% wont die of covid .
 at most underlying nia .
 who is responsible for this sense of security ?
 the problem is its  not a true vacine is it ?
 its quite balrdy obvious .
 vacicine is preveintion .
 this one is jab and jab for one to get get less symptoms .
 on top of that can still spread and spread .
 really twsiting the word  &apos;vaccine &apos;
 old people die nvm .
 gahment will just say underlying condition de
 me ,  she jin sexy 
 am so very tempted to post another  &apos;close laptop gif &apos; here again tbh

 ask chiu just take 20k per month salary job .
 chiu want to wait for 30k per month salary job .

 satki nus graduates command more allowance .

 but if moi started werking oredi ,  then have to pay moi own way  
 chiu have not answer my question ?
 what did science say about creation of humans ?
 fm where humans came from ?
 uh why ask me when u can google ?
 i have the answer and its from my scripture .
 how about your answers ?
 what did science tells chiu ?
 oh i not even interested in that topic haha .
 so what have u built with knowledge gained from your scriptures ?
 quickly find your future edmw flat mate here .
 next time can rent hdb room with him .
 then chiu wont be alone anymore .
 everyday pcw with him live .
 see what i mean .
 chiu dont even know the answers .
 yet chiu comment so much on religion .
 all your info are from google .
 chiu not interested in religion ,  no ?
 but chiu can google mah .
 ah is see what u doing .
 like i said it &apos;s not about me .
 its chiu vs science .
 chiu call believers disillusion .
 so i want to know how much chiu know about science .
 tell me what did science say about chiu .
 where did chiu come from ?
 i never claimed to be science expert leh .
 aiyo i am disappointed with how your religion has  &apos;helped &apos; mould your character to be honest .
 i hope for your religion &apos;s sake u are one of its worst examples .
 or are u the best ?
 @oreoiceblended mentioned about archiving pictures and voice in hard drive or cloud .
 i never belittle chiu nor praise chiu .
 just a simple question .
 oso go one big round .
 its an honest question .
 yet chiu not willing to answer .
 we stop here since chiu are not serious in discussion .
 u are just a troll la .
 u dont talk about things that have actually use in this world .
 i have given more real life examples to the benefits of science that u simply chose to not reply long ago .
 very typical cos u have no clue about whats happening in the real world .
 much less how to solve any problems .
 u too busy patting yourself on your back and condemning others for not obeying tour rules .
 a friendly discussion and i end up being a troll in your eyes .
 u said religion is rubbish .
 but i did not say science is rubbish .
 cant even answer a simple question .
 either chiu know or chiu dont .
 dunno then to google la .
 then i will take it from tere .
 thats how we discuss mah .
 not by calling names .
 i dont belong to science club leh .
 there is no gang of science people leh .
 u are the oni defensive one .
 u defensive of your  &apos;club &apos; .
 i am not science expert leh .
 u argue that your religion knows more than science cos u think u are expert see ?
 but chiu anti religion .
 so lets not talk about religion .
 its meaningless to chiu anyway .
 lets talk about science .
 so i am still waiting for your answers ?
 if unable to answer ,  then chiu are just as disillusion .
 ah ok i think u are finally starting to answer a little mmore intelligently .
 so yes u are right that i dunno enough about science anyway .
 but i have  &apos;faith &apos; in science compared to the scriptures or whatever bible or other superstitions .
 thus is cos all around us i see evidence of its great works and standards .
 and u may not admit it but u too have more faith in science than religion .
 but u just wanna be special since most people believe in science .
 thats why u are nothing but defensive .
 want to find new opportunities and do something different lor
 just say chiu left cos of family commitment .
 say something personal ,  they wont probe chiu much one if they want chiu and chiu have the skill sets .
 just give a very brief reply and move on talking about what chiu can offer .
 eng eng >6 months and <12 months before .
 depends how long chiu are jobless .
 chiu may tell them what chiu were doing during those times .
 some are ask ,  don’t really need to work .
 i have friends ,  can just play games all days .
 if resign without next job secure ,  why will have interviewer ask u thing ?
 if people ask u reason , anyhow say can oredi .
 they wont check one .
 is it legal for interviewer to ask so many probing questions ?
 got mentioned before i felt that the stuff i was doing was contradicting to what i suppose to do ,  and the role and responsibilities .
 and i’m not comfortable with that .
 wonder why they ask such stupid question  .
 if oredi happened liao and they have stereotype thinking no matter what ans see how they think lor .
 depends if chiu are looking for similar job/role
 i quit without a job previously .
 i just told the hr/hiring managers straight that i left cos the culture was toxic .
 dunnid to pretend it &apos;s something else cos if they are not understanding enough to understand that toxic bosses exist ,  and eliminate u for it ,  it shows that they are not good people to work with as well and u dodged a bullet
 “i spent some time doing soul searching” 
 best decision ever
 i resigned without a job previously and this is the top 1 question that i get asked by interviewers .
 i feel that chiu can be honest but to sound nicer and should be able to provide the justification .
 1) taking courses to upgrade urself .
 if working quite hard to do so .
 2) need to take a break after so many years of working .
 1) boss is a moron .
 2) i kena fired .
 3) workload too much cannot handle .
 4) the ol collick i like dont like me back .
 5) collicks all dont like me .
 true that ,  talking to interviewers that oredi stereotype candidates are a waste of time .
 choosing to focus on the past instead of the future ,  why chiu have left or are leaving instead what chiu can bring and add value to them .
 prejudiced and myopic .
 im intending to quit cos the culture here at my coy is getting from bad to worse .
 but worry that this reason isnt good enuf for hiring manager to accept .
 chiu can oso ask them back if dulan .
 i dont like interviewers asking stupid stuff .
 they question chiu ,  chiu oso can question back .
 some they dunno how to reply chiu and u will feel shiok .
 at least try to tahan awhile for the resume 1st .
 now quite risky to run road without a job offer secured on hand .
 is there a quota to the amount of sperm an average male can shoot in his lifetime ?
 hypothetically ,  an average male with average nutrition and average life span .
 use the formula multiply by length of kukujiao and divide by age
 for ts chiu can oni shoot once
 very confusing leh but look nice need time get use to it
 ts triggered the glassheart dickson in this thread liao  .
 dickson is a traitor .
 this is 98% of ccp tiongs way of thinking n logic leh include moi corlick n ccpibs leh .
 hainan ji fan oso from hainan right .

 lai liao lai liao .
 own camp got people compile lists and spread sheets suddenly become the other side doing  .
 tiagong even got radicalised telegram group  .
 jin scary mens ,  getting ready to submit lists for  &apos;kempeitai &apos; next time 
 jav is tiong de too .
 ts = tiong colleague .
 i want sug ts cok !
 this should be the way else risk jabbing for what .
 so many kumgongs jab so can dine in .
 before vaccines oso can dine in .
 what is the difference .
 30 dollars not enough to buy groceries lah
 lol u think these ah gong ah mas care ?
 most of them dont care about social media or even read newspaper    .
 i understand their mentality la .
 i so old aldy ,  even if dont die from covid ,  how long more can i live ?
 might as well enjoy life while i still can
 old people will know the word vaccine means prevention to geting the diseases .
 not this so called vaccine where chiu can still still get and spread .
 oredi said many times ,  this  &apos;vaccine &apos; is not a true vaccine and it aint the miracle cure
 we still have edmw ,  netflix ,  social media to kpkb and pass time .
 most of these seniors oni pass time is gather at void deck and play games .
 if stay at home all day oso will go crazy .
 not saying they are right ,  but can understand their behaviour
 endemic mah and vaccinated ,  what u want
 at least they got real friends to chit chat .
 bbfa oni hermit at hm pak game and pcc .
 uplorry oso no one noes  .
 please take the vaccine and take precautions at the same time .
 but those that reject vaxx entirely are just plain stupid
 ah gui pris untiong
 acherly they make more sense .
 vax liao just carry on normal lifestyle .
 how well your body reacts with the vax is leave it to fate liao .
 unlike anti vax ,  scared of vaccine but not scared of virus .
 i think water went into their brain .
 best thing is ,  if new cluster form they will start blaming unvax
 justice league warriors created by media since media keep reporting serious conditions for those unvax one
 even without jab .
 those lao funkers will still gather one la .
 cb i report to police so many times abt the chao lao uncles at my downstair drinking .
 sometimes got 15pax .
 knn police come and record statements then few days later the lao funkers come back again .
 scared dont vaccinate .
 vaccinated dont scare .
 if vaccinated still sama nose vaccinated then vaccinate for fark ?
 i always said ,  if a vaccinated person kena the covid ,  can he/she spreaded the covid or notch .
 if he can spreaded the covid ,  then he is as much a danger to others as unvaxxed .
 as far as swabbing is concerned ,  please swab him saem as swab unvaxxed .
 if he cannot spreaded the covid ,  then please no quarrantine him and let him run loose in society as normal .
 i was on the way to having 5m won .
 i just another 1m .
 please let me win tomorrow toto 1st prize plsssssss 
 gogogo surely need
 i would say i need $10m to retire
 factor in the spiral inflation probably need a billion in 40 yrs time
 depends on his expenses ,  4% withdrawal rate on stocks/bonds/etc means ~200k per annum .
 need this type of sorhai to contribute to the national tax to help the jobless(no work but millions in the bank ?
 some people live simply can retire with $200k .
 some people retire and still want to spend like no tomorrow $10mil oso not enough .
 so dunnid to listen to anyone .
 chiu decide how chiu want to retire and do your own math .
 tell him to wait next life loh .
 maybe after 100 years inflation can .
 just mean he doesn’t intend to retire soon .
 50 is a nice age to retire
 chiu can quit from full time employment anytime chiu want .
 there are people who have enough but continue to work cos they enjoy the work .
 i know a person save money everyday go home eat cai png ,  go running every week ,  dont smoke dont touch alcohol ,  dont even take coffee or tea .
 put every spare cent he have into unit trust .
 well he died before he reach his retirement and his son help him spend his fortune .
 told them that we teochews originated  from chaozhou .
 grandpa took a ship here many years ago .
 we have very rich traditions that stretched back thousands of years .
 told them in very stern voice that we are chinese and that we must remember our roots and traditions .
 engrish was never our mother tongue .
 that the british abandoned us when japan invaded us and killed many of us chinese brutaly .
 my son and daughter nodded their heads in deep thoughts…
 why chiu typing in engrish ?
 chiu must teach them how to eat teochew muay .

 from what i heard from my colleague who is ns police ,  they sometimes do that on purpose in order to test that the red light camera is indeed working .
 if he is right ,  then this could be one of the case .
 u guys must be dreaming if u think something is going to happen .

 and need to take side or make alot of enemies  .
 but i dont dare to resign without a job  .
 but i have been looking for past 2 years  .
 and simply cannot find  .
 anything close to my current income  .
 and my age will definite be my barrier when come to looking for job  .
 so many xmm and xdd  .
 and graduate and low pay   .
 even if i willing to forgo 50% of my current pay i may still not get the job lor
 not yet ,  but can feel just need a slight push to throw letter .
 half my team resigned oredi .
 how old are chiu bro ?
 what’s your current drawn and sector ?
 sunset industry or your current too high ?
 politics is always about choosing your enemy .
 choose wrongly and chiu suffer 
 nothing wrong de .
 its your privilege right ?
 called me troll .
 disillusion and the above .
 guess we stop here .
 not productive at all discussing with chiu .
 find something to occupy your time .
 for example learning something ,  and creating something .
 but of course if chiu don’t like learning ,  then can’t help .
 i am lucky to be endowed with a passion of learning .
 i find myself lack of time to catch up with my learning .
 well hope u feel better .
 time is precious to me .
 which makes no sense considering u supposedly have eternity in afterlife .
 just ignore my common sense .
 it is up to chiu .
 if chiu and your family members who take photos all the time ,  then it is good .
 or else there is no point .
 i dont do it for myself or my family .
 treasure every moment while it lasts ,  no regrets
 hate to say this .
 chiu oni have one mother/father .
 if chiu can afford to have a wife ,  then grant their wishes .
 spend more time ,  instead warang at the ceremony .
 it &apos;s like saying i know i am gonna have 50 billion dollars tomorrow but today im gonna treasure my 5 cents .
 bro its inevitable .
