 Despite the success of sequence-to-sequence RNN and Transformer models in Machine Translation (MT) tasks, most tasks still require a large parallel corpus. However, the progress in Unsupervised MT research has allowed for building of MT models without the need for parallel data, solely relying on monolingual corpora. This repository serves to explore the implementation of Undreamt, an unsupervised neural translation model, on Singlish-English translation tasks. The complete model is able to successfully learn Singlish-English word translations, but was unable to go beyond word-to-word translations. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first significant work done on Singlish-English machine translation.
