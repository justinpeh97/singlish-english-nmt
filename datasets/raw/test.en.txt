Don't act like you're innocent, I know you took my stuff.
How much salt to use for this dish? Just estimate!
Damn, why is this bus taking so long to arrive?
Damn! The tickets for the concert are all sold out!
The task got pushed onto me again.
She doesn't care about things at work and only does the bare minimum.
How could you go clubbing and not invite me?
You're so bored, wasting your time doing things your boss didn't even ask for!
Dinner at 7pm? Is that okay?
Can you explain the concept again, I couldn't understand it just now.
This exam question is so complex.
You better rush and complete this project before the deadline tomorrow.
Can you reserve a seat for me?
This design is really bad, even my toddler can draw it.
I'm not kidding, this place has the best laksa. It is a must to try it.
Don't just watch, come help us move the furniture.
Oh, it's raining again today? The weather's been so bad recently.
It's my problem, no need for you to be a busybody.
I have no plans this weekend, just going to chill and rest at home.
I'm looking for new kitchen appliances. Do you know where can I get them?
For this project, do it at your own pace.
Sorry, can you lend me some cash?
He stood us up to go on a date with his girlfriend again.
Do you want to skip work tomorrow?
You sabotaged your friend just to win the competition.
I'm feeling so tired after the 10km run.
This plate of chicken rice is so satisfying.
Crazy, how did oyu manage to eat five burgers in one go?
He's so annoying, I cannot tolerate his attitude.
I'm going to get takeaway lunch from the hawker centre.
The meal we had at that fine dining restaurant was so posh.
The weather is very warm in this country.
You cannot trust the person over there.
You don't need to bring a camera tomorrow.
He's very good at playing footbal too.
Damn, I am craving some chicken rice.
I will be waiting for you at the bus-stop.
That isn't good.
You can't just go like that.
Why didn't you show up?
I play badminton every weekend because I like it.
He's not feeling well, so he decided to rest at home and sleep!
He can play the piano.
I like to read storybooks.
Does your computer have a virus?
This one only cost 10 cents.
I am very naughty.
This house is very nice.
I am still finding.
Why are you playing music when it is already so late?
Are you looking for trouble?
That lady is his wife.
This boy is the class monitor.
His house is in Toa Payoh.
He talked for so long without stopping and wouldn't even stop when I asked him to.
When I was young, I went to school every day.
When he was in school, he always achieved good marks.
Last night I studied so much that I became very tired.
Oh dear, I cannot wait any longer. I must leave immediately.
They already went there yesterday.
Ah Song has gotten into trouble, what will you do?
He has already thrown it away.
I have eaten.
As for this new game, have you played it yet?
I want to.
This can be done.
Why didn't you hand in homework today?
Why didn't you pay just now?
Do you want this book?
Is this possible?
Did they not study?
Do you not like that?
What? Haven't you guys ever read a newspaper?
Go and think over it for a while, and then you might understand.
So I sat down, thought, thought and thought, until I understood.
Let's go sightseeing at Orchard Road.
Please don't mess with my things.
My son is about to enter Primary One.
We are close friends.
Retrieve the larger item, please.
He was scolded.
He was scolded
If you don't listen to me, you will be punished, after which you will know that you were wrong.
You will be punished unless you do your homework.
If you don't listen to me, you will be punished.
If you don't listen to me, you will be punished.
He was diagnosed with cancer.
He struck the jackpot.
I got fined, couldn't help it.
I got fined, couldn't help it.
How sad, he was diagnosed with cancer at such a young age.
Oh my gosh! He's so stupid!
I always do everything by habit.
He doesn't go to school.
It is how it is.
I did not do my homework, that's why I got a scolding.
I was really tired, which is why I knocked into that car.
When I'm late, only then do I take a taxi.
I will call you when I reach home.
We'll discuss this later.
You're the stupid one.
You're the late one.
If you want to see Justin bieber, then go!
Just drink!
I just don't have any of that!
I don't know any more than what I told you!
DOn't worry, he will be capable of doing it.
Don't tell me that he punched her?
But he is very good at Mathematics.
You didn't give it to me!
I did not punch him!
There good there is not bad, it is worth trying.
Can't you see that this choice will also work?
He knew about it as well.
If you don't do the work, then you're dead!
Fine, go ahead and do what you want.
If you're done working, you should go home.
Please, just give it to me.
Why aren't you giving it to me?
Argh, the tickets are really expensive.
The thing is, I believe it's better to be safe than sorry.
You didn't you give up your seat?
If you ask her to go ther eon foot, it will be a rather long distance.
And then, another person came out of the house.
This shopping centre is very nice isn't it?
Oh, yes!
So can it be done that way?
This boy is always so rude!
Why is it like that? 
Are you going again?
What? Is it true that he played truant yesterday?
What? How did he end up being caned?
Didn't they study?
You don't like that?
Is that really so?
He's damn capable.
Wow, we were lucky.
Are you crazy?
I am not so old, I am only 18.
Ah boy, don't go running around everywhere, otherwise you will regret not heeding my advice.
Any questions?
There were so many people at Marina Bay Sands yesterday.
Does this bus have air-conditioning?
There aren't any!
Can you please give that to me?
Sure!
No way.
He really seems pretty stupid, you know.
He's really acting like a one-year-old baby, you know.
Why is he acting this way?
I like this one too.
I tried so hard, and still I can't do it.
Do you know where he is?
Why did he go to the party alone yesterday?
Let's split up and eat.
When I played a game just now, my character died!
Of course, otherwise would it be at Woodlands?
Don't feign ignorance, where did you hide my phone?
Damn, my computer got affected by virus once again.
My dream is to eat an A5 Wagyu steak at an expensive restaurant with Joseph.
This guy is someone who is always confused.
He is someone who doesn't care.
Wow, you guys didn't invite me.
That girl at 9 o'clock is not bad.
I am unable to make it this Friday, I need to study for finals.
Wow, the weather is so hot, it is really intolerable.
That asshole came and annoy me once again.
This Kelly is someone who studies very hard.
Don't talk in such a sophisticated manner.
I really wish that the pretty girl is my girlfriend.
Faster rush to the canteen, otherwise there will be a long queue later.
Faster finishy our work so we can go home early.
I can't make it this Friday, I have a wedding to attend.
Help me to get take away good, I am very lazy today.
Shut up!
He is definitely in trouble this time.
Don't fool around!
Stop stealing my food, otherwise I will get annoyed. 
He is faking it. One look and you already know that he is lying.
Remember to check safety when you go backwards.
This Henry is very annoying, telling me that everything cannot be done.
You got full marks for Mathematics and now you're here to show off!
I don't care, I'm just going to confess to Sarah after our date tonight.
Don't be scared! If you want to fight, bring it on!
Henry is very nosy, constantly asking me about what I do with my girlfriend.
Jerry got scolded by his teacher for failing his test.
Wow, parents nowadays are very scared of losing. Their children have started going tuition at only five years old.
Ah boy, do you want to drink coffee with grandpa tomorrow morning?
Just suck it up.
If you don't know anything, just ask Timothy. He is experienced.
I lost an arm-wrestling challenge to a girl, very embarrassing.
This is my last warning! Don't disturb me. I want to study.
My friends and I like to chill at JEM after school.
Don't be like that! Shall we go drink beer to cheer up?
Do you have any opportunities to earn money?
Hey eye bag is so big that it looks like a panda's.
What do you want to eat for dinner?
Wow, our performance just now was very embarrassing!
It's okay if you don't want to help me, I can just ask someone else.
He only earns $3000 every month. How does he afford to buy a car?
What? They are unrelated.
Do you want to go to the beach this Saturday?
Serves you right! I have told you so many times yet you refuse to listen.
Ms Lim is very annoying, no wonder she is not marrid even though she is so old.
Just now, I fell down walking on flat ground, it was very embarrassing.
Sorry, I was bathing just now and couldn't reply your messages.
This Alex stood us up again. He is going out with his girlfriend instead of going out with us.
Very poor now after constantly eating good food this month.
I am going to skip school today.
My workplace is very diverse with people from many different countries.
Don't sabotage us later. It will be okay if we just keep quiet.
Can we take cab later? What if the MRT breaks down again?
Damn! His father just bought him a Lamborghini for his 21st birthday!
Move away, stop blocking the way.
It sucks to have to work again tomorrow.
There is a Barcelona vs Real Madrid match tomorrow! Very excited!
What the heck, he passed his driving in less than two months.
What the heck! The clothes I bought 2 days ago has a discount now.
Don't mock me. I know that you definitely scored better than me.
Very unlucky, bird shit fell onto my head.
I have already prepared everything nicely for you. Better not mess this up.
Xaver and I like to talk about stupid things.
Please, I will return you the money in 3 days.
Wow, lucky! Posted as a clerk to HQ.
This restaurant is very deserted but the food is good!
This guy is a show off, driving a different car to work everyday.
Wow, he is very good. He can memorise everything just by reading once.
They say that the government is giving money again, is that accurate?
There are drinks, fries, meat, vegetables and carbohydrates.
If we order the large quantity, we might get a cheaper price too.
Why do they want to eat dog meat?
You are the reason why Singapore has no creativity.
That's just not a creative script.
Are there still any crazy people watching Mediacorp?
Singaporeans are really scared of losing.
Who is more powerful?
There is no need to fight.
The godzilla will definitely run faster than the runner who got gold in IPPT.
If you throw the merlion in water, will it drown or not?
Why is our national icon a fictitious creature?
Are there any girls that want to date me?
Look at this guy complaining about the local hospital covering up his son's death.
I thought that they reduced the protein standard, hence it is no longer required for melamine to be added?
But without enough protein, is it still considered milk?
Has thread starter gone crazy?
Testing is the only way to know that you are free from COVID-19.
You can now buy the test kit and conduct self-testing if you wish.
In China, they conduct anal swab.
Did your nose get poked until it felt good?
Thread starter must have gotten poked everyday until it felt very good.
I didn't know that there are people who enjoy swab test.
After swabbing, you have to wait half an hour for results?
Just now when I went Guardian to buy my nicotine gums, I saw that the testing kit only cost 15 dollars.
They do not mind hugging and holding hand with other girls.
Are you a male or a female?
At least the Korean government has the balls to admit.
You can get COVID-19 and spread the virus even if you are vaccinated.
Is there full service?
Did the Korean government invest in Pfizer?
Luckily, I use brave browser.
Luckily, I use Microsoft Edge.
What do you mean by "dirty sites"?
Since you say shy to say that it is you.
Now you can use this to read The Online Citizen as well.
Maybe she broke up recently and cannot date her male colleagues who are already married.
1st date is for chit chatting.
Afterwards, try to find activities to fill the time.
Don't listen to your penis.
There are surely some guys chasing her.
Stop taking umbrage and just go for it.
Anyways, you need to provide photo evidence before asserting your point.
This means that her ex-husband(s) chose to divorce her.
I don't know what they put inside the dought that is so fragrant.
When you bite into it, the fragrance is very strong.
It is as if there is some spice or something.
Thread starter, you are very rich.
Do you have a wife?
Looks nice to eat.
Yes, it is correct.
It is allowed to use coins.
You will need to pay more for the one with eggs.
Did you guys not see? It was on Shopee.
Looks good to me.
It is not bad.
It was my first time eating Springleaf and I did not expect it to be so good.
Please, you cannot eat this everyday.
No problem, money can do wonders here.
By constantly appealing, he can surely push all the blame to the taxi driver and deceased, eventually walking away scot-free.
Not appealing is the stupid choice.
Just hang the killer.
You should automatically slow down when you approach an area with many old people or a big junction.
Is it the pretty little girl?
The killer is the taxi driver.
He should just accept it.
There is no need to read a nonsensical thread from some stupid person.
It is because a lot of TraceTogether tokens are now out of battery.
Has safe entry phased out yet?
What more do you want?
Or do you want him to kneel?
You can now ditch old distractions.
The battery can only last 3 to 6 months.
Pushing too much will once again result in backlash and cause headaches.
Any time is acceptable.
I only do not mind if it's a girl.
If it is a guy, I will cut off his penis.
A experienced person is spotted.
I did not even touch him, why is she kicking a big fuss?
Is it a crime to stand too near his table?
It was not like I knocked him or was affecting him in any way.
Saying that I am a timid person with a small penis.
Do you have any problem with that?
The prata is acceptable but the colour and taste of the curry do not go well with one another.
I disagree, everything tasted good.
How is it so cheap?
You should first have sex before discussing.
I am not sure if I can withstand the 2nd shot or not.
Skinny is unacceptable.
The condominium is quite cozy.
Isn't it clear to Singaporeans already?
I heard that it is okay.
Good question, it is Singaporean's graveyard.
Wow, it is so accurate.
It is as if those buildings got demolished using dynamites.
If the battery is dead, you should go and change it.
They will give you the advanced version.
It is not more important to brainwish people to take the vaccination else they expire, resulting in greater financial loss.
Damn, there is a need to change the battery every 4 to 6 months.
Many people took it but kept it at home instead of bringing it out.
It is already unacceptable.
After being badly embarrassed, he still wants to keep talking about it?
Wow, it is bloody violent.
By the way, there is a Singaporean acting in the show!
Furthermore, he is a major character.
Wow, the Singaporeans is acting as Shang tsung.
Whatever, the bluebird jokes have already started.
I no longer have appetite.
If it comes in this type of box, it is definitely expensive.
I thought that it looks more like BMT.
Does Prison food have such variety?
When I was in NS, we used stainless tray to eat.
Just felt weird with 2 penises around.
Where do you go to find that?
Let me have sex with your wife/girlfriend first.
Is there no jail term for killing a person?
So this driver's appeal is really stupid.
There is a child in everyone.
It is already gone.
Some of my actions are still childish.
Wow, you think too much.
Ask her if she wants to have sex.
Remember to show a picture as evidence.
It is fine as long as her husband is a billionaire.
She looks okay for a 46 year old.
As if you guys are vampires who will not grow old.
We have already moved on to COVID-19 passport.
People are unsatisfied if we do not use TT.
People are also unsatisfied if we use TT.
I am only asking.
Do for the sake of doing.
It is only a waste of time.
It is very accurate.
It is to make Israel look bad.
This asshole deserves more punishment.
They are different people.
Why are you the way that you are?
My dream has been totally destroyed today, thanks to you.
Already became nata de coco.
It is just that make-up covers things up.
The little bit of the house that we can see in the video so far is only average.
So pretty and rich with a high standard of living.
It looks like there are no mixed rice stalls over there. 
You must be carefeful with this one.
Do you mean that she calls another guy to come?
Typical Singaporean man.
If you put IMH in Yishun, the staff might also go crazy.
IMH is a nice place for a short walk and catch up over coffee.
It is not that all the crazy people are at Yishun.
It is that staying at Yishun turns you crazy.
Crazy people from Yishun who travel to IMH will self-recover from their mental illness after leaving Yishun area.
Yishun already has an IMH branch.
What trace with Bluetooth?
It is so strange using it.
It is still abit weird.
Anyways, renting a room in her 40s is a minor red flag.
She still doesn't own a house.
The solution is simple: just stay with you in the same room.
It is to satisfy each other's desire!
Can a Malaysian single own a house?
A 40 year old women is no longer considered a girl.
She is surely horny.
In my opinion, just pick someone with better income or is younger.
However, the most important thing is that you are happy.
The one on the left side is a Singaporean.
Is your cousin still alive?
I will see whether I can afford it.
Very cool, man.
Too full from eating.
I heard that there is one case in Taiwan.
Do not waste time, go all in.
I still haven't collected mine.
Most are already using it.
Of course no one will talk about it.
Amazing, they can still post on social media to show off the expensive free michelin meals and branded things they get.
You think that singles can easily buy a condominium?
Be careful of those who have to self-proclaim that they are petite.
If there is no recent picture, do not meet up.
You might get a scare if you see her in real life.
Drag to the toilet and have sex.
It is very fast.
When we were young, time used to pass slowly.
The worst is when you have no money.
At last show why Jax has bionic arms.
Wow, it looks good.
Their exhaust is very loud.
However, the car is still very slow.
I have a good laugh whenever I see it.
Otherwise, who will look at them?
Do you have a picture or video?
At least one has true power.
What does Charles Yeo drive?
It is fine as long as he is happy.
Is there a need to find a carpet?
The carpets these days are still very big.
Opposition party needs to be careful and not get themselves in trouble.
What are all these stupid idiots doing there?
After that, complain about the government.
Queuing in the great outdoors is a disgrace.
It is for them to post on social media and show off that they lead an "active lifestyle".
Did you forget that "active lifestyle" is the current trend?
Luckily, the nature walk near me is not too crowded and there is almost no one, it is very relaxing and you can enjoy the walk.
Also, the air is very fresh and cooling, just like air conditioning.
There are a lot of girls in the photo.
Complain about everything.
Is Darth Vader good or bad?
So on and so forth.
What type of black are you talking about?
Are you referring to those infesting at chennai business park or what?
A white, cool looking caucasian saving the day is not trendy these days.
I still prefer Chinese guys like Liu Kang, those bad guys are more fierce and cool.
The scorpion look is the most fierce and cool.
Looks like the casting is not bad.
The new one is also a Chinese, he is even a black ranger.
Shang Tsung looks terrible.
This guy is Japanese.
The person on the left side is a Singaporean.
He is the Singaporean actor with the most hollywood appearances.
Just saw the trailer, it looks not bad.
Wow, I am impressed, it looks good.
Having a female to have sex with is already very good, do you need to care whether she is pure or not?
According to edmw, finding a local girlfriend is already tough enough for Singaporeans.
Don't worry, they will be considered unvaccinated if they do not take the booster shot after 6 months.
This world is already in a mess.
That will mean that the blood bank has to change their labelling system.
The unvaccinated are unable to dine-in, watch movies or go shopping. They have to chance to date and will forever remain a lonely and fat person.
So, which one is OYK?
Last year, he said that schools have a low risk of transmission and will not close.
Every department has their problems, it's just that some problems receive higher media publicity or scrutiny.
Ministry of Transport is an unlucky job.
Whoever goes in will have bad luck for years.
Waste of money, for what purpose?
No money and yet still want to buy new toys.
Typical Singaporean behavior.
Going to eat Mookata later.
Laughing at simple minded Singaporeans.
Singaporeans are trapped in the rat race and unknowingly getting destroyed by the PAP.
Meanwhile, rich caucasians will talk about culture, sports, music, fine arts, food and travelling.
Damn, you don't even need to talk about rich caucasians.
Even South East Asian people like the Thais and Vietnamese also have more interesting topics to talk about like the Vietnam war, local culture, heritage, history and food.
Even Hong Kong people talk about politics, culture and hiking camping etc.
Why is no one worried that he is even driving in the first place?
She thinks that it is free to hire a lawyer.
Maybe there are car sales around Queenstown.
It is definitely bought but it is good to be thrifty as cars are a depreciating asset.
See who has the weakest connections.
At the rate that he is going, he will definitely be fined.
Only 13 percent of people in the USA are black people.
Luckily, he is fat.
Not so much hated, more like people are jealous.
Not a supporter of the CCP.
What matters is that you are happy.
Which female Singaporean can cook?
It is fine as long as they are good in bed.
Singaporeans only know how to make salad.
Waiting for 9k.
Still waiting for my 23k.
Business owners enjoyed alot.
There is none for the unemployed this time round.
Will there be a mortal kombat crossover soon?
Yeah, the eggs are a little watery but that's the way I like it.
How can you eat oatmeal?
I don't really like it.
Without carbohydrate, how can you gain muscles?
Are you a bodybuilder?
Looks not bad.
No offense, but it looks like shit.
Anyways, I won't believe it until bad things happen to me.
Random guessing gave me the correct answer 50% of the time.
Does it mean that there is already no chance of reverting back to normalcy?
So their plan to open up after the country is fully vaccinated can no longer be realized?
Who do you listen to when people are saying different things?
So, there is no point taking it.
I am now having aches until I no longer have the mood to work.
How heavy are you (in kg)?
I'll only date someone who is unvaccinated.
So the summary is that you decide not to be vaccinated based on skepticism and that you are trying to give me a lesson on intelligence and deceit.
Don't be like this.
Nowadays, is it still possible to overuse?
Data is so cheap?
After charging so high for mobile plans, they still lose profits?
In other words, is it your problem if you die?
Can this horrible logic be explained?
Lost trust in them many times.
Whatever they say or do, there is always an agenda.
From what I gather, most prefer their own cars.
This crazy person can get a Mercedes?
Has he ever won any case?
Your moronic post tell us that you have low IQ.
So, do you mean that lawyers should do cases for free?
It is really very retarded.
Then again, all of them are the same.
What is happening?
I heard that little girls love to hug it.
Who is this crazy person?
He is already getting his bonus next month.
F35 can also deliver tactical nukes.
Don't spout nonsense.
Is Dr Ng going to buy new toys this year?
It is time to buy nukes from USA and observe whether China still refuses to cooperate.
All the old toys were bought from a few years ago.
There is a need to replace and maintain.
Time to buy toys from cheaper alternatives like Russia or China.
After becoming more rich, do you still want to use the same old broken lock to safeguard your wealth?
Weapon suppliers complain that Singapore don't give them business.
They have already spent more than enough.
Singapore cannot use old toys to welcome them.
If we attempt to develop nukes, the first group of people we want to attack is probably the US.
I believe that the original actor is too old and out of shape to play Shang Tsung now, otherwise they would surely ask him.
It doesn't have the catchy OST like last time.
Is Liu Kang still one of the main characters?
It looks sick.
As long as that asshole Michael bay is not involved, it is still watchable.
As long as it is healthy for me and allows me to hit my required macronutrient intake.
Anyways, technically speaking, you don't need carbohydrates to build muscle.
What is this nonsense that you are eating?
Are you trying to lose weight?
Since it is your body, it is your call.
There is time to enjoy before treatment.
You people still go out for shopping.
My uncle advised me to test and catch more people which you know is unvaccinated.
Furthermore, alot of people are unvaccinated not because they do not want it but rather because of their age.
The super spreader is already spotted.
Another expert has started talking.
Take your jab as soon as possible, otherwise we will approve sinovac!
Since this is the case, might as well not do safe distancing measures.
Don't restrict gathering limits!
Since he now says that taking or not taking it does not make a difference.
Is it so hard to believe that someone who is unvaccinated can disagree with another unvaccinated person?
No matter the vaccination status, please make more babies as Singapore needs it.
So, you may have to wait very long.
How many people have died in the past two weeks?
He is really famous in Singapore and the rest of the world.
It must feel good as clients withdrew voluntarily so there is no need to refund.
Don't be surprised if he gets charged for CBT next month.
I just watched it yesterday at PS.
But I still prefer the 1995 Shang Tsung.
Very cool and fierce.
Who is the debate against?
Singaporeans don't vote the opposition party in and give PAP the supermajority.
A waste of money when our neighbour is not upgrading their military.
Big gains for the SAF.
Big gains for this year?
Why are they wasting so much money when our country keeps raising tax?
It is only a waste of money.
It has never gotten this bad in Singapore.
Without air conditioning, it is impossible to sleep.
However, you will feel the pain when the end of month utility bills comes.
Is it very hot today?
Have you ever experienced Dubai?
However, they have winter.
Is is quite cold but it feels good.
My room has never had an air conditioner.
Now, not all Macdonalds are open for 24 hours.
No egg is unacceptable for me.
By the way, how do you swallow if it is so dry?
The meat looks nice.
After eating for 2 months you will surely get bored and go back to delicious hawker food.
But how do you make it?
I also eat something similar.
I have to admit that it is not to everyone's taste.
Don't know about the rest.
Singaporeans, are you satisfied?
I think that many fat and lonely people are happy to avoid Chinese New Year.
There is a legitimately reason to avoid.
India have cooler lawyers than Singapore.
Unable to sue because of CECA.
Not sueing would mean a lack of guts.
Even if you sue them, they will not entertain you.
It is more embarrassing for Singaporeans to have this kind of defamation law.
I go there very often.
But luckily, I did not go at the same time as the cases.
Do not start a cluster and cause others to die.
Since this is the case, I will not get tested.
Are you scared of buying a test kit yourself?
It is the fault of the stupid Singaporeans.
Just remove the hoop, that's what they did to the one near my house.
Just using a sheet of metal to block the backet will suffice.
If it is not more than 2 pax playing, it is acceptable right?
I believe the experts, so I feel that it is compulsory to be vaccinated.
I think we already know about this one.
There is no need to a doctor or a minister to say it.
Otherwise, it is fake news.
Not being scared will also cause death.
Singaporeans just need to wear mask, wash hand and perform social distancing for the rest of their lives.
Pay all the useless paper generals and their toys.
How much will fighting a war cost?
It only looks good on paper.
I felt so lucky that she didn't notice my superman underwear, I will surely strike toto tomorrow.
I have never bought it before.
How much do you need to buy?
The toto for this week is tomorrow.
It's not a secret, it's just that normally when we buy tickts, we will win.
Where is the fun in that?
Can your computer flirt with you?
I wonder how many trials do you need before winning.
I think that the most unpleasant for me is when a fat uncle keeps squeezing and squirming beside me when the bus is super packed from town.
Old uncle take out shoes and shake his leg, airing his feet.
Dig his nose and stick the booger on the window.
If a crazy person can drive, I will avoid his car whenever I see it.
It's good business to be the preferred lawyer of choice for crazy people in Singapore.
Once you get used to it, it is no longer complicated.
You worry about road hogging, I worry if he becomes a crazy person and drives against traffic or stop in the middle of the road.
Do you belong to a high socio-economic status or a low socio-economic status?
To summarize, reduce travelling time as much as possible.
Youngsters nowadays are very weak, scared of abit of rain?
The website has already broken down.
Luckily I sleep naked on the marble floor.
50 bucks can get you 12-15 plates of mixed rice.
If not, what is Gen Y?
Is there evidence that it is a result of the vaccine?
Put baby powder and see if it can still stick.
Rub baby powder and see if it can stick.
Does this mean that she got the real vaccine?
If it is so low, can't you just hop over it?
It must be that someone complained, right?
I think that it was around back in secondary school.
The metal itself already cost quite abit, not the mention the cost of the necessary welding work.
I realize that nowadays new flats do not seem to have basketball and soccer courts.
Just removing the rim will suffice.
Do these people have a brain?
You will know how wasteful SAF is.
The store has a lot of ancient stuff left in one corner.
HOTO to a point where everything is lost.
That is why they keep spending.
Cut the defence budget by 1/3.
3 billion is a lot of money.
I would believe if it is Vivian saying it because he really is a professional doctor.
They should only be paid normal wages.
Visitors french kiss with the supermarket auntie.
All the old people in Bukit Merah already took Pfizer in March but they are sitll getting COVID-19 like nobody's business?
Why are they not linked?
Always see people not wearing mask properly.
This time, it will surely spread.
It it is not closed, it means that we can go.
This time, it is really bad.
I forgot to check out after leaving.
Me french kissing with the cute daughter?
I heard that the 44 year old guy that passed on works there.
If I am an elite scholar, do you think that I care about Bukit Merah?
It is more important to grow GDP.
I needed to take boat to school.
I would say that it is an acquired taste.
Last time, it got worse after I put condense milk.
There is no point to eat 100% clean for just 1 week and give up, right?
HDB still have it.
So, is it already dead?
Having cloth is already very good.
It can be worse than this.
Is there a difference?
This is the standard of people in Malaysia.
At my side, it drizzled for 2 minutes and then stopped.
Only drizzling and a bit of wind.
Bedok is experiencing big wind, hope that rain will arrive soon.
Finally, I can save $1 on air conditioning tonight.
You are jealous because you want to stand in my spot but you can't.
Dig nose and randomly sticking their booger.
The stupid excessively loud and squeezy earphones noises coming from those young punks, disrupting the otherwise peaceful ride.
I despise those people who air their feet and I feel like kicking their slippers very far away.
I haven't taken bus in a long time.
My mother said it.
Not cold, but cool.
My increase is around $20, furthermore it is April hence a need for more air conditioning.
It already feels hot.
Hope that it will rain the whole day tomorrow.
Don't attack me like that.
Armpit very sweaty.
I go for a walk or a jog after putting the kids to bed.
Do you want to smell?
My thermometer shows 30°C in the room without air conditioning.
Putting my air conditioning on dry mode until 27°C feels quite comfortable.
Useless piece of trash who only comes out and scare people.
If they say that there is no risk, that means there is really no risk.
If you die after vaccination or if there are side symptoms, it is never related to the vaccine!
You cannot blame them because all they do is say and encourage you to take it but they did not force you.
The government did not force you to take.
So, before I got jabbed, I checked and he already said that you can drink beer after the jab.
Moh says that it is not allowed.
No symptoms or problems for me.
There is no choice but to trust the government.
I want to have power similar to Quicksilver.
Then, there is no need to take the bus or mrt.
Running will also lead to sweat and becoming smelly.
What if this is the new variant?
Alot of people with nothing better to do.
Abit higher up and the armpit can be seen.
Who is Magento?
Those vintage cars are also very unique.
Yes, she has to stop damaging the image.
Furthermore, staying at a condominium now.
Wow, can he sleep well at night?
Damn, there is really a side of him that I now see.
I thought that COVID-19 is over.
It is still a pandemic, alot of Singaporeans are earning less and PAP sitll wants to spent $16B for USA.
Actually, whats the difference between spam and luncheon meat?
Its similar but different.
It is very nice to eat.
The one in Singapore is not bad.
Remember this and do what's necessary when the time comes, otherwise we are all ignorant people.
Wow, so racist!
If this is the result of cleaning, might as well not clean.
Nothing new from Malaysia.
Very common lazy attitude.
Whatever, on both sides of the causeway, the politicians also don't take public transport.
I wouldn't jump to such a conclusion so quickly.
Whatever, there are alot of naysayers.
I get that you are very strong and the rest of us are weak people who will be blown away but abit of wind.
You keep quiet and go to sleep.
Once again, the sky is very dark.
No sun, no rain, very windy.
Only for a short while.
Even without rain, they are carrying umbrella.
Are you referring to a time when policemen were wearing shorts and HDB only cost 30k?
The wind direction today is different.
Can you recommend which car to drive?
The worst is when I open the window and the old auntie behind complains that the wind is making her hair messy.
Uncle takes out his shoe and rub his toes using his fingers.
I ever experienced a driver who closed the back door while people are still waiting to alight from the upper deck.
Singaporeans look down on me because I take bus.
The auntie is unhappy that the kuay teow I bought has a smell.
Uncle molest my butt.
That's my list.
Can the bus window be opened?
I think I haven't taken the bus in more than 35 years.
Cannot stand people watching videos without earphones.
Anything also sticks.
I want to be a mutant too!
Phase 3 is already coming soon.
Already going down.
By end of August, I think that victory can be declared.
Singaporeans are all letting their hair down since the Friday announcement.
COVID-19 has been defeated once again!
If is okay for many group of 2s to be playing at the same time?
Similar to jogging, right?
Check if it is grassroot.
I like that you are very naive.
Classic Singaporean style, as Singaporeans don't know how to take initiative.
Only when they get caught and fined then they will cry and complain.
Just keeping the ball will do.
Kids can also climb over to play, right?
I also use slang when rich white passengers board my taxi.
So that rich white passengers can understand Singaporeans better?
This is a skill, not everyone can do it.
Singaporeans land workers only estimate using eyesight.
Since it is more straight, then it is okay.
Too horny, unable to take it anymore.
Next week rush to KTV.
I think COVID-19 will give us a chance to have a rest day.
National day is tomorrow.
After opening up and allowing dine in, the numbers will rise up quickly once again.
It is already under control.
I let the picture do the talking.
Do you want proof?
There are really many crazy people.
This is why I'm waiting until at least 50% of the population here is fully vaccinated, I will only go if there are no problems.
So be it, I am a crazy person acording to my haters here.
It is worse than flu.
Making it in Taiwan is way better and cheaper, need 20,000 pieces of these.
The article is only one day old.
Police firing missile is very cool and fierce.
Is it like when you wake up you don't feel good or did not get enough deep sleep?
I remembered that after a marathon, my sleep was really good but I woke up with pain everywhere.
I haven't had more than 5 hous of continuous sleep for god knows how many years.
I will surely wake up after 4-5 hours and try to go back to sleep.
In the long term, it will lead to dementia.
All the goodies under $10 have already been snatched.
I enjoy watching people play games and tip them.
I am more tempted for ROTK14.
Damn, time to buy games that I'll never play.
Can no longer take it.
Why don't the women go to his room instead?
There is a fine line between being a cheapskate and being down to earth.
Because many things are sponsored.
Leaving them with a huge debt that they take their whole lives to repay.
Of course, everything is sponsored.
There are definitely people who sponsor alot of things.
I want to find a girlfriend like Kim Tae Hee.
MOH should just hire more people to do contact tracing.
Althought everyone is vaccinated, they still get infected by COVID-19?
I have a friend who everydays tells me that she exercises or goes to the gym, but she is still chubby.
Has already doing for this 1 to 2 years.
Only wasting their time.
Did your friend really go to the gym or goes there just to take selfie and look at young girls in yoga pants?
After gym, reward themselves with bubble tea at 120% sugar level.
Most go to the gym only to use the toilet.
But still fat.
I have seen many, so far the true successful slim down stories are due to diet.
It means that it is just the wrong method.
Have the toilets installed it?
This way, I can deter burglars without spending money out of my pocket to install CCTVs.
Can it be installed at every front door?
It can also reduce dispute between neighbours.
Isn't he the leading local expert on infectious disease?
If not, what do you want him to say?
He did mention in an interview.
Because people in full PPE can also get be infected.
This is proof that experts are useless.
He always appears on CH8 news.
He might appear on the 630pm news tonight.
These days, it feels like it is always the big team who will win the FA cup or at least finish as runner up.
A huge waste of time and money for the clubs.
It also sucks if it is the always the big 4 winning.
They really went one big round.
Definitely no need to spend so much.
It is good to save money.
Is there none this year?
You have obviously never committed crime.
All murders in Singapore are unsolved.
Which murderer doesn't have a brain?
Nowadays, secondary school kids already look so mature.
You cannot cure stupidity.
Very budget meal today.
Takeaway from food court back to eat.
How to finish eating so many of them?
Where can this be bought?
Trust me, no matter what film it is, as long as it is from China, there is more or less some propaganda.
Some are very nice.
What kind of nonsense is NOC?
They should blatantly say that it is to generate more income, instead of saying that is is more entertaining for the fans.
What stupid cup is UEFA Conference League, another 3rd tier cup for UEFA to make TV money?
Always exercise but unable to control diet, hence they cannot lose weight.
Frustrating to see.
I see a lot of girls going to the gym only to run at the threadmill, their main purpose should be going there to find a rich boyfriend.
After that, secretly eat potato chips and chocolate in her room.
Diet is very important.
Of course not.
Like this, do I have to put on make up and dress nice at home everyday?
Is his penis itchy?
Can both of them be deported?
If they had, I think it should be okay.
Stop trying to cause trouble.
What if the government comes up with something worse?
Propaganda already coming.
It can be finished.
I am already halfway there.
Looks very nice to eat.
Damn, already sold out.
I think this meal of yours cost more than mine.
Maybe slightly more.
Yes, I too have such a friend.
We are not close but I always see her showing off her gym moments with her friends on IG, then going to eat afterwards.
But I'm not fat or anything.
Disclaimer: this is not a pretty girl.
Luckily, I have already taken Moderna.
It was okay the next day.
What lucky? They will release news saying that you need to replenish your jab every few months.
Everyone so obedient?
Which one is nice to eat?
Heard that it can cure any illness.
No discount, pay full price.
No longer a rare gem.
Or do people think he will be gone?
Not satisfied if PM shows his face or doesn't show his face.
Used to be my dinner place.
Not cheap yet use MSG.
If those cheap "cook and fry" stalls use, you cannot complain.
Wow, you are a big eater.
Can treat me the meal?
Takeaway and slowly eat.
If it's not hot, it's not nice to eat.
Even if you get it, you will not need to go to ICU.
What are they selling?
Go to KFC just to eat chicken?
Getting chubbier despite working out everyday.
It already exist.
Do you have something to hide?
When it is real, they will definitely complain.
I heard that is just pink.
If not, what did you eat?
Frappes are very sweet.
What an asshole.
It is definitely a Singaporean.
Couldn't believe that it is Singapore until I saw that bus.
Nothing better to do, what a waste of time.
The bare minimum requirement for a leader is to show face.
He needs to show that he is still the one making decisions.
Otherwise, it will give the impression that he has handed over to LW.
Great, just go.
There are people who are already triggered.
Are you dreaming?
However, there still exist people who visit each others' houses for social activities.
Is today a good day to go JB?
I eat very casually for the rest of the week.
Bro, how is this sinful?
The vortex campaign is also pretty interesting.
A great value for money.
I assume that there is no harm, right?
It won't happen.
I'm a typical Singaporean.
When there are free stuff, I just take them first and then talk about it afterwards.
Really temping us to eat until we get fat.
Is the minion potato nice to eat?
It is nice to eat when it is hot and crispy as it is soft on the inside.
Does it taste like hash brown?
It is really hard to slim down.
By the way, how much is one?
Heard that it is not bad.
It is still expensive.
I heard that doom eternal is very fast.
I also haven't gotten it.
Okay, it is already reported to the police.
The reason is that the next exit is 500 miles away.
Are you not a burger person?
Did she threaten to tell her husband?
This type should just result in a death sentence.
Very tempting to get it.
There is a difference.
Some people complain about everything
How much is the damage?
Just save petrol oil.
Going the wrong way is very bad.
Wow, really taking it to the next level.
Crazy, hope the crazy person gets exposed.
Does the driver suffer from brain damage?
To be honest, it's like Singaporeans.
Wow, you all are so supportive?
But worry about diarrhoea the next day.
Which female star will he be co-staring with?
This is really extreme.
Booster also expires?
This is really very sneaky.
I can only say that they asked for it.
TS, have you already tested putting it on?
Did you forget or do you not know?
Yes, it has already been tested. L is abit too tight-fitting for me. 
I see many auntie looting L too.
Walk down and saw that there were no people so I quickly went to take.
Those folks are extremely sick.
I think that the physical abuse is even worse.
No other choice left.
You all are rich.
Buy to collect and never play it.
Even if you want to save petrol, it is not done this way. 
Luckily I wear a wig.
Rarely get diarrhoea after eating chili.
What kind of girl do you like?
Why all pay the same price?
Don't you have to pay more for master bedroom?
Why did you expose people's secret?
What matters is that he is happy. 
Going to eat this until Wednesday.
Tell me, how do you resist it?
Which type do you buy?
Is the quality good?
Just play casually first.
Played for a short while and then returned it.
Felt like vomiting afer playing it.
But don't know if I want to buy again or not.
Do you really belong to my generation?
Wow, already so old?
Ask him wait until you have finished eating before talking.
Just display!
There is no use complaining now.
By the time elections come, Singaporeans would have already forgotten.
Her Instagram has these as well.
I'd love to slap her butt cheeks until they become red.
The liquid is warm.
I have already confessed.
Please give me a chance.
Heard that its a female driver.
A lot of people are like that.
It is fine as long as they are happy. 
Or maybe they are just gay.
Wow, rent costs so much now?
Need to support rental market.
Luckily, I haven't taken the booster jab.
If they say that you must jab, it means that you have to jab. 
I thought that it is only 6 months.
Wonder how much they are going to charge.
So what do we follow?
How many Mcspicys have you gotton so far?
Ate 4 yesterday for lunch and dinner.
I bought many 1 for 1 KFC banditos instead.
Haven't gotten it yet.
TS did not have diarrhea 4 times today?
Built by her construction friends?
Did not cut ribbon?
There is nothing impressive about her past career.
They are older than your grandmother and yet you are masturbating.
Crying without tears.
She appears to be very impressive.
Definitely break through all defences with one spike.
Are you such an auntie, collecting so early?
Just show.
I thought that it is allowed?
Does the person mind that something is wrong?
So dangerous.
Is there a need to put make up to go exercise?
I suspect too.
Anyway, these people are really immoral.
Not just a burger.
Diarrhea after eating.
Food that will definitely cause diarrhea for me.
I had a lot of diarrhea just now. 
I think that I no longer want to eat Mcspicy for dinner.
Eat too much and soon pants cannot be buckled.
This is so similar to JAV.
But young people are like that.
Stupid university students.
Already told you all. 
Been wanting to get this for the longest time.
I think that it is the winter sales.
PS5 is already out.
Only the one on the left is acceptable.
But still, not bad.
Really nice body.
In Singapore, anyone, regardless of high risk, low risk or no risk, can get the booster jab.
Just say that phone has no battery.
Everyone is talking so confidently but will just obediently show the vaccination status when asked.
The tables at hawker centres are all fixed to the floor.
Many crazy people.
Wow, very cool.
Is his girlfriend his mother's friend?
Singaporeans are too stressed.
There is a smell.
Ok, go ahead.
Many little boys are already watching JAV.
Noah Yap kind of looks like a gangster.
Really very immoral.
Wow, female Egyptian in Singapore.
Mcspicy is still yummy.
Eaten 2 so far.
Where is the promotion?
Equally nice to eat.
Luckily, I just managed to order 1-for-1 Mcspicy before outlet closed.
They don't want to treat their parents as maids.
These Singaporean men are really a disgrace.
Want to behave like rich caucasians.
Want to show women that he is already matured.
Maybe they had sex with many girls before turning 28?
Not even referring to you.
Maybe will ask mom how to have sex with girls.
Maybe he already had sex with the aunties?
Have you tried the stretch beside h81?
There are no more raw fish.
How can we identify?
Are condominiums undervalued now?
Do you think that people will buy condominium or landed property?
You really behave like a drunk elephant.
Just buy, there is no need to wait.
In my opinion, it is cheaper than steam.
What cheap games are there?
They did mention, but in the fine print.
So are we going to die?
Is there another choice?
Don't worry!
Has it been released?
Yes, can start collecting.
Go to the counter to buy.
You people should avoid eating too much western food. 
Give chance food a chance!
What coupon is there today?
I only saw the one with the ice cream.
I have already redeemed my sausage egg mcmuffin. 
Will it refresh again the next day?
Most little boy have watched porn in primary school.
Forgot what it is called.
Are you jealous that I get paid more than you to do nothing?
No need to be jealous, I definitely earn more than you.
Need to close the lights for sex.
Does her real face look like this?
Luckily, handphone did not drop into the toilet bowl.
Singapore has a lot of crazy people.
So what is the Singapore court going to do?
He just needs another sex toy!
Are you following me?
Need to embrace as it is an open society.
This deal is not bad.
Which payment method do you all use to pay?
Xbox controller.
Really a waste of time.
It has already crossed 1 million.
You may call him a crazy person, but he provides much hidden information that we don't know about.
Why did you scold her?
Another very hot day.
It is very hot everyday.
So are we also going to die?
Please, they don't even have US $23?
Is it still available tomorrow?
Her makeup is very thick.
Can it be pulled up and down?
Came in thinking that there is a pretty girl.
The masked got stucked so it didn't drop.
But luckily, I think that it doesn't count.
The legal system in Singapore is not good.
Why has the penis shrunk?
She should've taken it out on the husband too right?
Luckily, there is no worldwide demand for Sinovac vaccines, so it could be cheaper.
Parents are surely very angry.
I thought that it expires after 180 days?
Does it mean that we have to jab every year?
Got tricked?
It is a known fact.
SecretLab is making big wave overseas but getting flak over here.
Creative has support.
No need to stay away.
Can it win the caramel frappe?
Trouble, seems like the app cannot be opened now.
But it must be a lot.
What mexican burger is coming?
I saved the cheese sauce and eat it with fries, it is really nice!
Do you have time to play?
Weather so hot, there will definitely be sweat.
Unable to withstand even for half a day.
I think the mask turns mouldy after 1 week.
Wash once a week?
All the rent money is wasted.
Don't know why there are morons talking about learning to do house work and cooking by moving out.
All crazy people from top to bottom.
You also bought it right?
They are only imagining.
How much did you lose?
Next time, there will be no more Chinese New Year in Singapore.
Is it hotcakes 1 for 1 tomorrow?
Heard that his mother is a teacher?
Ended up being influenced by online rubbish.
As simple as that.
Singapore is too comfortable for her.
Expected a picture of a pretty women wearing mask.
This one is indeed very ugly.
Has the penis buldge shape.
Unfortunately, the mixed rice stall was not open yesterday.
Are there cute ghosts?
Singapore hotels not doing any better.
Scared that there is not enough time to clear after buying.
Only 3 weeks jail?
Why is it that I do not know?
You all tell me!
Can save red packet money as well.
It is better if you worry about yourself.
What is the purpose of worrying?
Now it as if they print 3 trillions in 3 months.
No pretty women in Starbucks.
Not fair to say that people are stupid.
Luckily you all mentioned.
I have Aftershock as well.
All along they say that taking the jab will suffice.
Big is more comfortable than small.
Please don't talk about her in that manner.
Watching it will cause headache.
You can google and see if I am lying to you or not.
Happiness is more important.
Seeing it causes frustration.
Almost killed her.
It is fine as long as he is happy.
No wonder there is a need to move out.
But did he worry about you?
Long queue everywhere.
After striking, there is no need to work anymore.
Is there such thing as a surge down?
There is the PAP to hold up USD.
TS, are you guilty when you sell junk to people?
Why did people say that Macbook has a battery life of 9 hours?
To him it might be treasure.
Luckily I treasure it.
Are you from Nepal?
In this case, how to go to Starbucks?
Quite true as well.
Mine is definitely L size.
There are also some predictions that in December, there will be a deadlier virus.
Do you think river ang bao bazaar and performance will also be cancelled?
Seeing it makes you feel like vomiting.
So they know a few meaningless skills and then laugh at people who don't know or are not so skilled in it.
From my perspective, really very meaningless.
TS posting meaningless threads.
This TS has nothing better to do.
I got blacklisted.
I was a bit shockd when I saw Allen Wu as he was only similar height as me.
I was very shocked.
The day is unlucky.
Can the famous kueh survive now without tourist?
Him being the winner shows how rigged the award is.
I think Salah doesn't care.
They are using last season's contribution for the award.
Give up, TS.
Are the breasts getting bigger?
The voice is very bad.
Looks very saggy.
How many tissues has she stuffed inside?
It's super slim and the touchbar is very sexy.
Carousell has a lot of funny people. 
But too bad it is already sold. 
What model are you using?
Carousell has alot of crazy people.
I don't entertain anymore.
Can't go visiting during Chinese New Year and can't go holiday.
Heard that end of this year is going to be phase 3?
Luckily, saved a lot on red packet money.
If the government ask you to jab, just go jab!
I put it in the freezer for many months.
My math is very bad.
No need to explain much.
Think that's already the best one in the location.
That one is not bad, right?
Why are there no hotels here going bankrupt?
Why have we yet to hear similar news over here?
I didn't want to read anymore after reading halfway.
Play innocent and carry on.
Or feign ignorance and don't mention him.
I went there and the guy acted innocent and say that he doesn't know.
Don't feign ignorance that this is the first time you know about this.
Just feign ignorance.
Our governemnt likes to feign ignorance.
If they buy from shop run by gangsters, it will be much cheaper.
Some of them from gangster shops are used ones.
This gangster is as fat as a pig.
No gangster or crazy people.
I want to grow up to be like him, a gangster.
This one is the gangster version.
He was previously scouted when he acted as a gangster with Joanne Peh.
Gangster shops cannot be trusted.
I am a Singaporean gangster through and through.
I am not a gangster.
She has  PhD but has less wisdom than a gangster that roams the streets.
They can knock out those Singaporean young punk gangsters anytime they want.
Gangster look.
Her ex also resembles a gangster, she is definitely attracted to this kind.
Had sex with gangster boyfriend too?
Probably had sex many times with young punk gangster.
The guy looks like a typical gangster.
My BMT buddy is very weak, he hang there and cried when he couldn't do a pull up.
Not sure if it's a girl, boy or a transgender women.
No wonder I saw a transgender women cross dress there.
Oh my god, I meant Louis Armstrong.
Oh my god, I became fat.
Oh my god, did not properly read.
Oh my god, who asked him to call?
Oh my god, say clearly!
Oh my god, the videos can no longer be watched.
Oh my god, missed it.
Oh my god, he is very busy.
Oh my god, the Facebook post has been removed.
Oh my god, yet to wake up?
Oh my god, I have eaten there before and used the toilet.
Oh my god, wanted to live bet but it was too late.
Oh my god, that girl doesn't know what is shame.
Oh my god, why hasn't she gotten married?
Oh my god, why didn't you marry her last time?
Oh my god, next time, don't get married.
Oh my god, another round of fraud?
Oh my god, I realise that I posted in the wrong thread.
Do you think people will be more forgiving if he is Andy Lau instead of looking like his face got run over by a lorry?
I see many social media comments solely attacking the perverts.
Doesn't change the fact that he is a pervert.
There is no way all the perverts will not be perverted anymore. 
What will happen to the perverts?
Looks like a pervert.
Everytime I see him I only think of perverts.
Don't tell me that there are no perverts in the same area.
Reminded me of some pervert here.
So many perverts.
I guess the next video will be the number of ladies that he prey on.
Lucky I don't have friends that are perverted and creepy.
Perverts do not check in when they go KTV.
She gave the perverts in Singapore a booster shot.
She might just be doing an honest living and infected by the perverts around her.
This fat caucasian definitely has health issues.
Maybe just to differentiate from Japanese green tea from western tea.
There are other caucasian who criticised China, should we take those as truth as well?
Asians are not so crazy about heights, unlike caucasians.
They don't believe in these because they are caucasians right?
Why do western countries not have any chinese ghosts?
He claimed to have hooked up with many caucasian ladies.
And it's like why caucasians still celebrate halloween.
Caucasians who come to Singapore automatically become cool.
My sister's caucasian boyfriend is the type of nerdy caucasian.
So these caucasians do not need to quarentine when they go back?
You have caucasian friends too?
Looks like a caucasian.
This kind of backstabber must be condemned.
This thread has a lot of big talk but until now the backstabber has not been revealed. 
Backstabber in this thread trying hard to shift the discussion away from finding out who he is.
Faster go snitch, don't wait anymore!
Purposely report him to the police.
Must be backstabbed by people she know.
Maybe her niece backstabbed her?
Don't know who backstabbed him.
Annoying snitch.
Time to snitch to MOM.
